Rock fragments\nof quartzite, limestone and phyllite range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 40 percent in the C horizon.\nMost pedons have flakes of mica that generally increase with\ndepth.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma\nof 2 through 4.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine, medium or coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 4.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth."

The Belmore and Chili soils have water worn gravels throughout.  Blackhammer soils have a solum greater than 60 inches thick.  Chenault soils are formed in old alluvium. Coggon, Hayden, Leroy, Pecatonica, Renova, and Westville soils formed in glacial till.  Conestoga soils have a Bt horizon with values higher than 5 and chromas higher than 4.  Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Hebron, Kalamazoo, Kanawha, Kendallville, Martinsville, Nodine, Ockley, Princeton, and Sisson soils are stratified in the lower part of the solum.  Grellton soils have more sand in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Hickory and Rawson soils are mottled in the solum.  High Gap, Military, Norden, and Whalan soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Hollinger, Relay and Strawn soils have a thinner sola.  Kidder, McHenry, Miami, and Theresa soils have free carbonates in the series control section.  Lindley soils have rock fragments of glacial pebbles.  Mandeville soils have rock fragments of micaceous shale.  Kosciusko, Mifflin, Owosso, Riddles, and Wawasee soils have more sand in the control section.  Rockbridge soils have 35 to 70 percent rock fragments of gravel and cobbles in the lower part of the solum.  Summitville and Richland soils have rock fragments of siltstone, sandstone, and shale.  Woodbine soils have an upper solum formed in loess and glacial till and a lower solum formed in weathered residuum of limestone."
