The underlying outwash may contain up to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy coarse sand, sandy loam or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The lower subhorizons may have Fe depletions and concentrations. Texture is typically stratified with coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand but averages sandy loam or coarse sandy loam with less than 30 percent fine and very fine sand. The clay content averages 8 to 18 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.

Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 29 inches. The frost-free period  ranges from 90 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1280 to 1610 feet."
