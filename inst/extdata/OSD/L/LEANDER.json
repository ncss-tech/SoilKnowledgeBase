  "OVERVIEW": "The Leander series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy sediment or colluvium and underlying outwash. They are in closed depressions on pitted outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
