  "OVERVIEW": "The Limber series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone bedrock.  These soils are on upland hills, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
