  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Levyville soils are on Karst uplands of West Central Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 54 to 64 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Archer, Hague, Mabel, Micanopy, Shadeville, Williston, and Zuber series.  Archer, Shadeville, and Zuber soils are in the thermic temperature regime.  In addition, Archer soils are on higher positions, are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, and have more clay in the subsoil, the moderately well drained Shadeville soils are on lower positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness, and are deep to limestone bedrock while Zuber soils are on similar positions and have more clay in the control section.  Hague soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The somewhat poorly drained Mabel and Micanopy soils are on lower positions and have more clay in the control section.  In addition, Mabel soils have bedrock or boulders within a depth of 60 inches.  Williston soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, and have more clay in the control section."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Levyville soils are used for cultivated crops or tame pasture.  The natural vegetation consists of laurel oak, live oak, magnolia, loblolly pine, cedar, and scattered cabbage palm.  The understory commonly consists mainly of bluestems, panicums, greenbriar, sand blackberry, pineland threeawn, and a variety of other perennial and annual forbs."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic Horizon - the zone from 8 to 80 inches depth (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\nLevyville soils were formerly included in the Zuber series.\nThe type location was moved to its present location due to lab data of sampled pedons indicating little decrease in clay below a depth of 58 inches.  The classification was changed from Hapludalfs to Paleudalfs.\nThese soils are very moist to saturated at depths of 5 to 6 feet for 1 to 3 months during most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Citrus County, FL; S9-25-(1-7).
