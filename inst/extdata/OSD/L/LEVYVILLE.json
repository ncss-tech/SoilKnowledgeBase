  "OVERVIEW": "The Levyville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on Karst uplands of west central Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 59 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Archer, Shadeville, and Zuber soils are in the thermic temperature regime.  In addition, Archer soils are on higher positions, are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, and have more clay in the subsoil, the moderately well drained Shadeville soils are on lower positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness, and are deep to limestone bedrock while Zuber soils are on similar positions and have more clay in the control section.  Hague soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The somewhat poorly drained Mabel and Micanopy soils are on lower positions and have more clay in the control section.  In addition, Mabel soils have bedrock or boulders within a depth of 60 inches.  Williston soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, and have more clay in the control section."

The natural vegetation consists of laurel oak, live oak, magnolia, loblolly pine, cedar, and scattered cabbage palm.  The understory commonly consists mainly of bluestems, panicums, greenbriar, sand blackberry, pineland threeawn, and a variety of other perennial and annual forbs."

The classification was changed from Hapludalfs to Paleudalfs.\nThese soils are very moist to saturated at depths of 5 to 6 feet for 1 to 3 months during most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Citrus County, FL; S9-25-(1-7).
