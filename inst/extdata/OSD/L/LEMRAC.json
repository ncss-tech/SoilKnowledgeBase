  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemrac series consists of moderately deep to paralithic contact, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed dominantly in residual deposits derived Carmel formation alabaster gypsum.  Lemrac soils are on structural benches and dissected sideslopes with slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and mean annual air temperature of about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are formed in residual deposits of alabaster gypsum, commonly from  the Carmel formation.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The freeze free period is 120 to 150 days."
