  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lemrac soils are on structural benches and dissected sideslopes. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. These soils are formed in residual deposits of alabaster gypsum, commonly from  the Carmel formation.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The freeze free period is 120 to 150 days."

Progresso soils are on low knolls and small benches, over sandstone.  Rizno soils are on hills and knolls ande are shallow to hard sandstone bedrock."
