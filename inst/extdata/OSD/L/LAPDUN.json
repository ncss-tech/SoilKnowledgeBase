  "OVERVIEW": "The Lapdun series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sediments derived from rhyolite, andesite, and latites.  These soils are on alluvial fans with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
