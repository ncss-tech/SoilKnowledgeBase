  "OVERVIEW": "The Lecyr series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. The Lecyr soils are on ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
