    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass, 2 to 6 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 75 to 100 percent phosphate retention.  The particle-size control section averages over 50 percent rock fragments, consisting mainly of andesite cobbles, stones and boulders.  Stones and boulders may cover up to 30 percent of the soil surface.  Base saturation is less than 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A and AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy sandy loam or ashy loamy sand.  It contains 5 to 20 percent andesite gravel, 0 to 5 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 10 percent andesite cobbles, 0 to 5 percent andesite stones, and 0 to 2 percent andesite boulders.  It has 15-bar water dry of 10 to 15 percent.  Acid oxalate silica is 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry.  It is medial loamy sand or medial sandy loam and it contains 0 to 20 percent andesite gravel, 10 to 30 percent andesite cobbles, 20 to 50 percent andesite stones, and 0 to 10 percent andesite boulders.  It has dry 15-bar water of 15 to 25 percent.  Acid oxalate silica is 3 to 5 percent."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic ash and andesite from Mt. Mazama and Union Peak, respectively.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 80 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period ranges from 0 to 50 days."
