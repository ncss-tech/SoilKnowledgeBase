    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The solum is 15 to 40 inches thick.  Typically, these soils are calcareous throughout but are leached for a few inches in some pedons.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 0.8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 60 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Rock fragments are usually less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it has fine granular or crumb primary structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline (pH 7.6 to 8.2) and is generally calcareous except for the surface few inches.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4.  It is usually light silty clay or clay and clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 40 percent with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon has moderate strong prismatic primary structure that parts to angular blocks.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6) and has 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Collbran, Harney, Nunn, Richfield, Sofia, Valmont, and Wormser soils have lithochromic hue no redder than 7.5YR.  Valmont soils have loamy-skeletal substratums at depths of less than 40 inches.

The soils formed in eolian or eolian-modified reddish calcareous sediments high in very fine sand and originating from redbed formations.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
