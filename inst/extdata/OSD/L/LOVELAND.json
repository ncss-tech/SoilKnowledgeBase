  "STATES": "CO,NM,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Loveland series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from a variety of rock sources.  These neaarly level to sloping soils are on flood plains and low terraces along the smaller streams draining the Rocky Mountain areas.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
