  "OVERVIEW": "The Lulude series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basic extrusive rocks, tuff, and breccia, with accompanying volcanic ash and cinders.  Lulude soils are on hills, ridges, mesa summits, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

This is based on the general pattern indicated by lab data for western Colorado.\nThis series could be in both the Typic and Ochreptic subgroups based on the given range in thickness of the argillic horizon (5 to 22 inches).  The classification will provisionaly remain as Typic pending a proposed change in the Alfisols to exclude moderately deep soils such as Lulude from the concept of the Ochreptic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon: from 3 to 17 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: from 25 to 33 inches (Bt horizon)\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 25 to 33 inches (the entire argillic horizon)\nLithic contact: at 33 inches.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Seventh Edition, 1996."
