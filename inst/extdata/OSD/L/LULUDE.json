  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lulude soils are on hills, ridges, mesa tops, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in material weathered from basic extrusive rocks, tuff, and breccia, with accompanying volcanic ash and cinders.  Elevation ranges from 9,000 to 11,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 34 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 32 to 38 degrees F and mean summer temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 25 to 60 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision adds the superactive clay activity class to the classification.  This is based on the general pattern indicated by lab data for western Colorado.\nThis series could be in both the Typic and Ochreptic subgroups based on the given range in thickness of the argillic horizon (5 to 22 inches).  The classification will provisionaly remain as Typic pending a proposed change in the Alfisols to exclude moderately deep soils such as Lulude from the concept of the Ochreptic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon: from 3 to 17 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: from 25 to 33 inches (Bt horizon)\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 25 to 33 inches (the entire argillic horizon)\nLithic contact: at 33 inches.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Seventh Edition, 1996.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
