Cuddeback soils are dry continuously in the moisture control section from April through October and have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Nealy soils have a calcic horizon with 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate and overlie unconsolidated alluvium at a depth of 26 to 60 inches. Tenwell soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments and are strongly alkaline in the control section. In addition the control section is characterized by the presence of secondary carbonates."

The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation occurs in winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is  4 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."

Arizo soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and do not have a duripan or an argillic horizon. Crackerjack and Fortirwin soils are on similar landscape positions. Crackerjack soils have a loamy particle-size control section, are shallow to a cambidic duripan and do not have an argillic horizon. Fortirwin soils are shallow or very shallow to a duripan and have loamy particle-size control sections."
