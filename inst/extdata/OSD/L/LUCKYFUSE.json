  "OVERVIEW": "The Luckyfuse series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The Luckyfuse soils are on erosional fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",

Cuddeback soils are dry continuously in the moisture control section from April through October and have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Nealy soils have a calcic horizon with 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate and overlie unconsolidated alluvium at a depth of 26 to 60 inches. Tenwell soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments and are strongly alkaline in the control section. In addition the control section is characterized by the presence of secondary carbonates."
