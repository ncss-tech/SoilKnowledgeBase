    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Klossner, Medo, Natchaug, Palms, Philbon, and Shalcar series. Klossner and Palms soils formed mainly in herbaceous fibers. Medo soils have sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section. Natchaug soils have a mean annual precipitation of more than 940 mm (37 inches). Philbon soils have peat and mucky peat in the upper 30 cm (12 inches). Shalcar soils have a 2Bg horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Linwood soils are in drainageways and depressions on lake plains, end moraines, ground moraines, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Linwood soils formed in former lakes or ponds that range in size from a few acres to several hundred acres. The soils formed in highly decomposed woody, organic materials underlain by loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 940 mm (28 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F)."

Edwards soils are underlain by marl at depths less than 130 cm (51 inches). Willette soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the C horizons at depths less than 130 cm (51 inches)."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic layers and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic layers and moderate or moderately slow in the loamy material."
