  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  Depth to hard and soft shale or sandstone bedrock is 40 to 72 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Fragments of sandstone and shale less than 2 inches across make up 0 to 5 percent by volume of the A, 0 to 10 percent in the Bt horizon. Fragments from 1/2 inch to 5 inches range from 10 to 70 percent of the C horizon.\nThe A and Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.\nTexture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, and 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles are few to common in shades of brown, yellow and red.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or rarely silty clay or clay.  A lithologic discontinuity may be evident in some pedons, but it is not a requirement of the series.\nThe BC or C horizon has color and textures of the fine earth fraction as those in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Some pedons are mottled in shades of these colors without a dominant color.  Some pedons have a Cr horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alonzville, Bailegap, Beersheba, Gunstock, Hambrook, Harmiller, Jefferson, Keener, Lily, Marr, McCamy, Raftville, Riney, Sassafras, and Sunnyside series in the same family. Alonzville soils are on stream terraces. Bailegap soils have more coarse fragments in the solum and bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Beersheba, Gunstock, Lily, and Raftville soils are less than 40 inches to a lithic contact. Hambrook, Marr, Sassafras, and Sunnyville soils formed in Coastal Plain sediments. Jefferson soils formed in colluvium and have a higher content of rock fragments in the A and B horizons and are more than 60 inches to bedrock. Harmiller and McCamy soils formed in metasedimentary rocks. Keener soils formed in colluvium of arkose, metagraywacke, and quartzite.  Riney soils are very similar and have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR throughout the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lonewood soils are on broad smooth plateaus and convex ridge tops.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent, but are commonly 2 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in a silty mantle, 1 to 3 feet thick, and in the underlying residuum of shale and sandstone.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is 57.8 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 56.2 inches."

Clarkrange soils are on gentle slopes and have a fragipan.  Alticrest and Crossville soils are on similar positions, are less than 40 inches to bedrock and lack argillic horizons.  Ramsey soils are commonly on steeper slopes, are less than 20 inches to bedrock and lack argillic horizons"
