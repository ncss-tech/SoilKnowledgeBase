  "OVERVIEW": "The Livonia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy over loamy glaciolacustrine deposits typically covered by a surface mantle of sandy or loamy human transported material. These soils formed on low beach ridges, deltas, drainageways, nearshore zones, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

They are on level or nearly level surfaces and typically have slope gradients of 0 to 4 percent but range to 6 percent. The soils formed in sandy over loamy glaciolacustrine deposits typically covered by a surface mantle of sandy or loamy human transported material except for pedons located in forest preserves and cropland areas that typically do not have human transported material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",

The Livonia series will likely replace the Tedrow soils with a loamy glaciolacustrine substratum on deltas, drainageways, beach ridges, and nearshore zones.\nA substratum phase of dense till with 32 to 52 percent clay is recognized within a depth of 150 to 200 cm."
