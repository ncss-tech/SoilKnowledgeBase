Danabrook and Saybrook soils form a drainage sequence with Lisbon soils. The poorly drained Drummer and Elpaso soils are on lower positions on the landform. Herbert and Odell soils are on similar landform positions nearby. Herbert soils lack a mollic epipedon. Odell soils formed in a thinner mantle of loess."

Possibly a new soil series will be established.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 43 to 99 cm (17 to 39 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 91 cm (36 inches) - the contact between the Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
