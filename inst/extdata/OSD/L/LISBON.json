    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lisbon soils are on nearly level to gently sloping till plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 351 m (679 to 1152 feet) above sea level."

The moderately well drained Danabrook, Parr, and Saybrook soils and the well drained La Rose soils are on higher positions on the landform. Danabrook and Saybrook soils form a drainage sequence with Lisbon soils. The poorly drained Drummer and Elpaso soils are on lower positions on the landform. Herbert and Odell soils are on similar landform positions nearby. Herbert soils lack a mollic epipedon. Odell soils formed in a thinner mantle of loess."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. An intermittent perched water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1.0 foot to 2.0 feet) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material."

    "content": "REMARKS: The type location was moved from DeKalb County, Illinois to Boone County, Illinois in May 1997. A silty clay loam substratum phase is recognized. This soil will be investigated during MLRA update activities. Possibly a new soil series will be established.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 43 to 99 cm (17 to 39 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 91 cm (36 inches) - the contact between the Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
