  "OVERVIEW": "The Lochsa series are deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered from granited, mica-schist, gneiss, or similar acidic rock. Lochsa soils are along canyon breaks and on mountain slopes and have slopes of 25 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
