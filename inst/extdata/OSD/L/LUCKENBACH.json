  "OVERVIEW": "The Luckenbach series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in ancient loamy or clayey alluvium. These nearly level and gently sloping soils are on alluvial plain remnants or stream terraces and along narrow valleys on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 ,mm (26 in) and mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in rangeland. The remainder is used for cropland, orchards or wildlife. The major crops are forage sorghums and small grains. The climax plant community is a tall grass prairie. The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other plants include sideoats grama, vine mesquite, yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, Canada wildrye, live oak, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, hairy wedelia, Texas cupgrass, tall dropseed, and plains lovegrass. The dominant forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and bushsunflower. The woody plants include elm, live oak, hackberry, bumelia, green briar and elbowbush. The site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, and buffalograss. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as tumblegrass, hairy tridens, Texas grama, red threeawn, western ragweed, broomweed, prairie coneflower, and Ashe juniper, will dominate the site."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Luckenbach soils were formerly in the Pedernales series which does not have a mollic epipedon. This soil was changed from a Typic Argiustoll to Udic Argiustoll in August 1989 because of change in Soil Taxonomy. However, most of the acreage and the typical pedon are located in the Typic Ustic moisture regime. Other areas are mainly on the Udic/Ustic and Typic/Ustic line. Therefore, we are classifying this soil in the Typic subgroup in 1990. NSSL lab data near the series type location in Gillespie County, Texas identified high shrink swell and slickensides suggesting a vertic subgroup.  Classification was not changed pending a study over the entire series extent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 46 to 97 cm (18 to 38 in) (Bt horizons)\nIdentifiable calcium carbonate: Secondary forms of calcium carbonate in all horizons below 76 cm (30 in)."
