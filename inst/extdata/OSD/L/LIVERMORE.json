Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Livermore soils occur at elevations of 100 to 1600 feet in a dry subhumid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 14 to 22 inches with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winter; an average January temperature of 48 degrees F.; an average July temperature of 71 degrees F.; a mean annual temperature of about 59 degrees F.; and frost free season is 185 to 250 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Livermore soils are geographically associated with Pleasanton, Yolo, Cortina and Positas series and they are similar to Pleasanton, Cortina, and Millrace soils.  Pleasanton soils are gravelly and have moderately fine textured B horizons. Cortina soils are very gravelly coarse textured alluvial soils, lacking B horizons.  Millrace soils, developed in very gravelly coarse textured alluvium from basalt and andesite, have coarse textured sola but are otherwise similar."
