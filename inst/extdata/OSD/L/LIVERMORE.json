  "OVERVIEW": "The Livermore series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Livermore soils are on low nearly level terraces and gently sloping alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Pleasanton soils are gravelly and have moderately fine textured B horizons. Cortina soils are very gravelly coarse textured alluvial soils, lacking B horizons.  Millrace soils, developed in very gravelly coarse textured alluvium from basalt and andesite, have coarse textured sola but are otherwise similar."
