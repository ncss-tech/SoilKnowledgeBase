  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates ranges from 35 to 65 inches. The particle size control section is 35 to 55 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent sand. Rock fragments, mainly pebbles, range from 0 to 2 percent in the solum and 0 to 5 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Clay content ranges from 15 to 40 percent. Sand content averages 3 to 15 percent. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky. It is strongly acid to slightly acid, except where limed.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 0 to 2. Below a depth of 30 inches, some pedons have subhorizons 2 to 16 inches thick that have chroma of 3 to 6 and low chroma redoximorphic depletions. Texture is clay, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 30 to 55 percent. Average sand content ranges from 3 to 15 percent. Structure is weak or medium, fine to very coarse angular blocky, subangular blocky, or prismatic. It is strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and slightly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Clay content is 30 to 55 percent. Sand content ranges from 3 to 15 percent. Some pedons have loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam below a depth of 40 inches. In these areas, sandy, loamy, or silty substratum phases are recognized. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lorain soils formed in Wisconsin age glaciolacustrine sediments in depressions on lake plains, terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Frost free days range from 133 to 198 days. Elevation ranges from 575 to 1300 feet above sea level. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 29 to 43inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 54 degrees F."

Canadice soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have the dark surface layer. Caneadea soils also do not have the dark surface layer and are on slightly higher topographic positions. Ellsworth, Mahoning, Miner, Rittman, and Wadsworth soils formed in till and are on adjacent till plains. Valley soils are on similar landscapes as Lorain but have glaciolacustrine sediments underlain by till within 35 to 60 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Permeability is moderately slow in the surface soil and very slow in the subsoil and substratum. In undrained sites depth to the apparent water table ranges from +0.5 to 0.5 foot from November to June in most years and commonly ponds sometime during this time."
