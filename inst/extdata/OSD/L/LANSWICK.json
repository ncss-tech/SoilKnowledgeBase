  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanswick series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.   Lanswick soils are on  flood plains, drainageways, and flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
