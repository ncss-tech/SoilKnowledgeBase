  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil moisture - Usually dry, but is moist in some part 25 to 35 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Soil temperature - 48 to 53 degrees F.\nParticle-size control section - 12 to 18 percent clay with more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Depth to duripan - 20 to 40 inches. Sodium adsorption ratio is 0 to 10 in the surface and 20 to 60 in the B horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  However, it is not darker than value of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, both broken and crushed.  The horizon is slightly calcareous or moderately calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures is loam or silt loam.  Pebbles range form 0 to 10 percent.  It is slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Pebbles range from 5 to 30 percent but commonly are less than 10 percent.  It is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bqk horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 5 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent pan fragments with the combined rock fragment total not exceeding 35 percent.  Textures is cobbly loam or gravelly loam.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and the freeze-free period is 120 to 160 days.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F."
