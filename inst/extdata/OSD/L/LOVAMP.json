  "OVERVIEW": "The Lovamp series consists of deep, somewhat excessively well drained soils that formed in loess over glacial moraine deposits from metamorphic and volcanic rocks. Lovamp soils are on upper elevation mountain backslopes. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

They formed in loess over glacial moraine deposits from metamorphic and volcanic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,590 to 3,350 meters. Climate is cold, semiarid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 900 mm that occurs largely as winter snow. Snow load is persistent from late October through mid-June. Additional moisture occurs as late summer thunderstorms. The mean annual temperature is 2 to 5 degrees C and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."

Daphsue soils have a mollic epipedon that is 18 to 36 cm thick and averages 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Jackmore soils have a clay content of 2 to 10 percent and an ochric epipedon. Lowemar soils average a clay content of 5 to 10 percent in the particle-size control section, have a base saturation of 15 to 45 percent, and an umbric epipedon that is 50 to 100 cm thick."
