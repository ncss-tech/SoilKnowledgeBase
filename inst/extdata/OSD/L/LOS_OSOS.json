  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of sandstone or shale is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees to 67 degrees F. and the coldest temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F.  All of the soil between depths of about 4 and 12 inches is continuously dry after some time in May until some time in October.  Some or all of the soil between these depths is moist all the rest of the time.  There is 6 to 15 percent clay increase (absolute) from the A horizon to the B2t horizon and the soil lacks an abrupt A/B horizon boundary.\nThe A1 horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, brown, or dark brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and has moist value of 3 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and it has weak to strong structure.  This horizon has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, dark brown, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown, brownish yellow, pale brown, light olive brown, light brown, or light brownish gray in 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y hue.  In most pedons it has one unit higher value and one or two units brighter chroma than the A horizon.  This horizon is heavy clay loam, clay, or silty clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has weak to strong angular or subangular blocky structure or is prismatic in the upper part and is massive in the lower part in some pedons.  The B2t horizon is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a C horizon consisting of a weathering front.  The C horizon is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam."

Fagan and Todos are underlain by soft sandstone or shale at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Gabino soils have 5YR hue in the argillic horizon and have 10 to 30 percent pebbles and cobbles. Gridley soils are moderately well drained and are neutral to moderately alkaline. Marcum soils have paralithic horizons at 40 to 80 inches and are neutral to moderately alkaline. Sespe soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon.  Sween soils have 10 to 15 percent (absolute) increase in clay from the A horizon to the B horizon, and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Los Osos soils are at elevations of 100 to 3,500 feet.  They formed in material weathered from firm to hard sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry, somewhat foggy summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 40 inches.  Average annual temperature is 56 degrees to 63 degrees F., average January temperature is about 51 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is 200 to 320 days."
