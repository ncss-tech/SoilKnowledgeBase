  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlespring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over beach sand derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff. Littlespring soils are on stream terraces and basin-floor remnants. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
