These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over beach sand derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 1,740 mm. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
