  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlegray series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced slope alluvium over basalt. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
