  "OVERVIEW": "The Labu series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residuum weathered from clay shales.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum is typically 25 inches and ranges from 16 to 28 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum averages between 45 to 60 percent clay.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Cracks 1/2 inch to 1 1/2 inches wide and several feet long commonly extend through the solum when the soil is dry.  Tongues of the A horizon material are common in the Bw horizon and some extend through the solum when the soil is dry. A horizon material is common in the Bw horizon and some extend into the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It commonly is silty clay, but includes clay.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  Pressure faces are common to many.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay or shaly clay.  Some pedons contain fine gypsum crystals.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Platy shale fragments are medium or coarse."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Boro is the only series in this family.  Similar soils are Boyd, Bristow, Lakoma, Monowi, Millboro, Norrest, Okaton, Opal, Promise, and Sansarc.  Boro soils lack bedded shale between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Boyd, Opal, and Promise soils have mollic epipedons and Opal, and Promise soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Also, Promise soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedded shale.  Bristow, Okaton, and Sansarc soils are less than 20 inches to bedded shale.  Lakoma soils lack vertic characteristics. Monowi soils lack montmorillonitic mineralogy and have higher amounts of gypsum.  Millboro soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. Norrest soils have mixed mineralogy and argillic horizons."

Labu soils formed in clay residuum weathered from dark colored shales.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 56 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

Boyd soils are generally on lower slopes.  Bristow and Sansarc soils are on steeper slopes.  Monowi soils are generally lower in the landscape.  Promise soils are on lower foot slopes.  Mariaville soils formed from siltstone and occur above Labu soils.  Reliance soils are deep and formed in silty materials and occur generally above Labu."
