Badwater soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 36 to 40 degrees F.  Dailybasin soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Delhew soils have the base of the argillic horizon between 24 and 40 inches from the soil surface.  Keman soils have mean summer soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F.  Parkalley soils have the base of the argillic horizon between 28 and 35 inches from the soil surface, average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and are dominated by flagstones.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 52 to 58 degrees F.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostcannon soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope positions below avalanche chutes.  They formed in colluvium derived from granodiorite.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 7,500 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
