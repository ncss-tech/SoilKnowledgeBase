  "OVERVIEW": "The Loup series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, rapidly peremable soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 53 centimeters (21 inches).",
