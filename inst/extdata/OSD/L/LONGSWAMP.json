  "OVERVIEW": "The Longswamp series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in till and alluvium from mixed sources with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These\nsoils are on footslopes and gently sloping drainage sideslopes of mountains.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Depth to redoximorphic features range from 30 to 45 inches.  These soils have a water table 36 to 60 inches from the soil surface, March through June.

It has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.25 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.\nThe 2AC horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is cobbly sandy clay loam, gravelly loam or clay loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 2.5Y and 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.
