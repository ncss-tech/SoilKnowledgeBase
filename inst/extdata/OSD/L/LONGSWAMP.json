    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to redoximorphic features range from 30 to 45 inches.  These soils have a water table 36 to 60 inches from the soil surface, March through June.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 30 percent rock fragments and 20 to 30 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 25 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has chromas of 1 or 2 moist.  It has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.25 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.\nThe 2AC horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is cobbly sandy clay loam, gravelly loam or clay loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 2.5Y and 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly loam or clay loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Cg horizon has hues of 2.5Y and 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longswamp soils are on footslopes and gently sloping drainage sideslopes.  These soils are usually on southerly aspects at elevations of 3,600 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in till and alluvium from mixed rock sources with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 120 days."

Burget soils are 10 to 20 inches to weathered granite on shoulders and ridges of open south slopes.  Crocamp soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock on open south slopes.  Myerscreek soils are very deep formed in till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  Sitdown soils are very deep formed in sandy-skeletal outwash and till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  Toats soils are very deep and have an umbric epipedon on open backslopes with southerly aspects."
