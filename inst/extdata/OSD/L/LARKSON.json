  "OVERVIEW": "The Larkson series consists of deep, well and moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in materials weathered in place or only locally transported from soft noncalcareous sedimentary deposits.  Larkson soils are on fans, footslopes, valley sideslopes, hills, and ridges with slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Ranges in color listed below are those normally found for crushed color of the composite horizon.  Actual variation is often greater than indicated.\nA horizon\nHue--2.5Y through 7.5YR when crushed\nValue--4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist\nChroma--1 through 4\nReaction--pH 6.4 to 7.4\nE horizon\nHue--2.5Y through 7.5YR when crushed\nValue--5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist\nChroma--1 through 4\nReaction--pH 6.2 to 7.2\nBt horizon\nHue--2.5Y through 7.5YR\nValue--5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma--1 through 6\nTexture--heavy clay loam or clay\nReaction--pH 6.4 to 7.6\nC horizon\nHue--2.5Y through 7.5YR and is commonly variable but some pedons have uniform colors\nTexture-- heavy clay loam, loam or light clay\nReaction--pH 6.4 to 7.6"

Fortwingate, Osoridge, and Pylon soils have bedrock at a depth of less than 100 cm.  Campspass, Citadel, and Rolla soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon, have subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation, and lack the variability of soil color found in the Larkson soils. Goldvale soils have uniform color of 5YR or redder in the major part, have a solum thicker than 140 cm to the base of the argillic horizon, and more than 60 cm to the top of the argillic horizon, and have a sandy loam C horizon.  Zuni soils have uniform hue of 5YR or redder in a major part of the solum.  Virkula soils formed in a silty mantle over residuum from igneous and metamorphic rocks and are more acid."
