  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F.  A thin A horizon generally is present but is absent in some pedons.  The soils are calcareous below 40 inches in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Sediments of the parent Dawson and Arapaho formations occur above depth of 40 inches in some pedons, but are of such low contrast that they cannot be consistently recognized from the C horizon.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter and range from 1/8 to more than 10 inches in diameter. The A and E horizons typically are uniform in color but the rest of the solum ranges in hue from 2.5Y through 2.5YR as a natural feature of the parent materials.  Ranges in color listed below are those normally found for crushed color of the composite horizon.  Actual variation is often greater than indicated.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR when crushed, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR when crushed, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR and is commonly variable but some pedons have uniform colors.  It is heavy clay loam, loam or light clay to a depth of more than 60 inches.  The horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Campspass, Citadel, Fortwingate, Goldvale, Osoridge, Pylon, Rolla, Virkula and Zuni series. Fortwingate, Osoridge, and Pylon soils have bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Campspass, Citadel, and Rolla soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon, have subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation, and lack the variability of soil color found in the Larkson soils. Goldvale soils have uniform color of 5YR or redder in the major part, have a solum thicker than 55 inches to the base of the argillic horizon, and more than 24 inches to the top of the argillic horizon, and have a sandy loam C horizon.  Zuni soils have uniform hue of 5YR or redder in a major part of the solum.  Virkula soils formed in a silty mantle over residuum from igneous and metamorphic rocks and are more acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Larkson soils are on fans, footslopes, valley sideslopes and hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  They formed in materials that have weathered residually or have been only locally transported from the soft noncalcareous sedimentary deposits.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F."
