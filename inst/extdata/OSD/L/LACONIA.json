  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ginat and Sunken series. The Ginat soils have have no appreciable differences from this series other than a lower calcium carbonate equivalent below 2 meters. Sunken soils have an organic surface layer 2 to 8 inches thick and formed in slack water tidal coastal plain alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Laconia soils are in depressions within karst landscapes. They formed in 20 to 40 inches of silty alluvium derived from loess and the underlying local fine-textured lacustrine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 53.2 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is 47.9 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bedford, Bromer, and Crider soils, all of which are on higher positions. The moderately well drained, very deep, Bedford soils have a fragipan in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained, very deep, Bromer soils have fragic soil properties. The well drained, very deep, Crider soils do not have redox depletions in the solum."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible to ponded in some areas. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low to moderately high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. In drained areas, an apparent water table ranges from 0.5 feet above the soil surface to 1.0 feet below the surface from December through April in most years."
