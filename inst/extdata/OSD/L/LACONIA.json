The moderately well drained, very deep, Bedford soils have a fragipan in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained, very deep, Bromer soils have fragic soil properties. The well drained, very deep, Crider soils do not have redox depletions in the solum."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low to moderately high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. In drained areas, an apparent water table ranges from 0.5 feet above the soil surface to 1.0 feet below the surface from December through April in most years."
