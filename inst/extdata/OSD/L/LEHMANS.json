These soils formed in slope alluvium from andesite, basalt, rhyolite, tuff, and volcanic breccia.  Elevations range from 1700 to 4000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July and August and as gentle rains in December-February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days."
