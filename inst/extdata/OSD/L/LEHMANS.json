  "OVERVIEW": "The Lehmans series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium from volcanic rock.  Lehmans soils are on pediments and hills and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

These soils formed in slope alluvium from andesite, basalt, rhyolite, tuff, and volcanic breccia.  Elevations range from 1700 to 4000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July and August and as gentle rains in December-February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days."
