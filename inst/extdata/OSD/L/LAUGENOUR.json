  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are calcareous between the depths of 10 and 20 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is between 60 and 65 degrees F.  Lime is present above 10 inches.  Where undrained, it is saturated with no oxygen during part of the year.  The average clay content of the 10 to 40 textural control zone is less than 18 percent and there is more than 15 percent coarse, medium and fine sand.  Organic matter content is less than 1 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, or 5Y 6/3 or\n6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 3/2.  Distinct or prominent mottles and moist chroma of 2 occur within 20 inches.  It is loamy fine sand to silt loam.  It is subangular blocky or massive.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y 5/4, 5/2, 7/6; 5Y 5/2, 6/3, 6/4; 10YR 5/3 or 4/3.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/4, 4/2, 3/2,2/2; 5Y 4/2, 3/2, 4/3, 4/4; 10YR 4/2 or 4/3.  Distict or prominient mottles are common.  It is stratified loamy sand to fine sandy loam with lens of gravel, sand, silt loams and silty clay loams.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline and lime is usually present except for loamy sand or sand horizons."

Hueneme soils lack mottles within a depth of 20 inches.  Lemoore soils have sodium in the series control section.  Piper soils lack stratifiction in the series control section.  Tyndall soils have thin dark surface horizons and lack stratifications in the series control section."
