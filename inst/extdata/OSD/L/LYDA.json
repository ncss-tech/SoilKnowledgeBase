  "OVERVIEW": "The Lyda series consists of very shallow and shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from mainly volcanic sources. Lyda soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
