Lougee soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years.  Lougee soils that occupy depressions frequently pond during spring and fall in normal years and after periods of heavy rainfall. Lougee soils on flood plains flood frequently for brief to long duration during spring in normal years and after periods of heavy rainfall."
