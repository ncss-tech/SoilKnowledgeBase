  "OVERVIEW": "The Lougee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in 40 to 130 centimeters of moderately decomposed organic material over sandy glaciolacustrine, outwash, or fluvial deposits. These soils are on flats and depressions within glacial lake plains and outwash plains and less frequently on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

Lougee soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years.  Lougee soils that occupy depressions frequently pond during spring and fall in normal years and after periods of heavy rainfall. Lougee soils on flood plains flood frequently for brief to long duration during spring in normal years and after periods of heavy rainfall."
