  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy eolian and/or glacial lake sediments on glacial lake plains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

The particle-size control section has less than 25 percent medium sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon (when present) is as much as 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand but thin subhorizons of sand or loamy sand may occur. Some pedons may have suhorizons of loamy very fine sand,  fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam below 60 inches. The C typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."
