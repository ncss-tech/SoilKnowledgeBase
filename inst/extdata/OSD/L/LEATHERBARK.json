Siltstone, shale and sandstone rock fragments range by volume, from 5 to 20 percent in the A and E horizons, 5 to 35 percent in the BE, and Bw horizons, and 20 to 55 percent in the C horizon.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.  The BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E horizons).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 37 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons).\nc.  Aquic moisture regime - redoximorphic features in the horizon below the E horizon.\nPrior edits: DGF-WFH-ART-MEM 01/2002.  Current changes were to update depths.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record - WV0125\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
