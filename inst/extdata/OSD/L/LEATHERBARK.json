  "OVERVIEW": "The Leatherbark series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone, sandstone and shale on broad ridgetops and upland depressions on mountains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
