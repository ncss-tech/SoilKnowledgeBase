  "OVERVIEW": "The Latahco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from the surrounding loessal uplands. Latahco soils are on low terraces, flood plains and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
