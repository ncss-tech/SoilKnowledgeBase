They formed in alluvium or eolian sand over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,867 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
