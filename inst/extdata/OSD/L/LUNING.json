  "OVERVIEW": "The Luning series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian sand over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Luning soils are on fan aprons, fan skirts, inset fans, alluvial flats, alluvial fans, sand sheets, beach plains, and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
