  "OVERVIEW": "The Ludington series consists of moderately well drained soils moderately deep to a paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale.  They formed in siliceous sandy alluvium and loamy residuum on pediments.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the sandy alluvium, moderately slow or moderate in the loamy residuum, and very slow to moderately slow in the interbedded sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum and depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to loamy residuum from interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 15 to 39 inches.  The sandy mantle has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (0.02 to 2 mm fraction).  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon.  Coarse fragments are mostly sandstone channers but, in some places, these soils occur near higher lying glacial soils and igneous fragments are in the upper part of some pedons.   Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the residuum.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle but ranges to neutral in the upper part\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neytral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.   Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Thin strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.

The poorly drained Elm Lake soils and the somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Ludington soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Merrillan soils and the moderately well drained Humbird soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the sandy mantle is absent.  The moderately well drained Rockdam soils are nearby on landscape positions similar to those of Ludington soils where the sandy mantle is more than 5 feet thick."

Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the sandy mantle, moderately slow or moderate in the loamy residuum, and very slow to moderately slow in the interbedded sandstone and shale. Ludington soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Although the perched water table occurs fairly high in the soil, the duration of saturation is relatively short and the soil is moderately well drained."
