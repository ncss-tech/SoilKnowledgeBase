    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum and depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to loamy residuum from interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 15 to 39 inches.  The sandy mantle has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (0.02 to 2 mm fraction).  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon.  Coarse fragments are mostly sandstone channers but, in some places, these soils occur near higher lying glacial soils and igneous fragments are in the upper part of some pedons.   Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the residuum.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle but ranges to neutral in the upper part\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neytral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.   Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Thin strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on pediments underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale (Eau Claire and Mt. Simon formations of the Elk Mound group).  Slope gradients range from 1 to 20 percent. Ludington soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium and in loamy residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Elm Lake, Fairchild, Humbird, Merrillan, and Rockdam soils.  The poorly drained Elm Lake soils and the somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Ludington soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Merrillan soils and the moderately well drained Humbird soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the sandy mantle is absent.  The moderately well drained Rockdam soils are nearby on landscape positions similar to those of Ludington soils where the sandy mantle is more than 5 feet thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is medium or rapid.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the sandy mantle, moderately slow or moderate in the loamy residuum, and very slow to moderately slow in the interbedded sandstone and shale. Ludington soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Although the perched water table occurs fairly high in the soil, the duration of saturation is relatively short and the soil is moderately well drained."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for woodland. Second growth forest is common with  northern pin oak, jack pine, and some red maple and paper birch the common trees.   Some areas are used for cropland.  Corn, small grains and hay are common crops.  Some areas have been planted to pine trees."
