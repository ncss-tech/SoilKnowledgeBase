  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lowlein series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of outwash sediments and in the underlying loamy calcareous till or lacustrine sediments. These soils are on nearly level or convex slopes on ground moraines, glacial lake plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
