  "OVERVIEW": "The Lepoil series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Lepoil soils are on nearly level to steeply sloping, dissected marine terraces and have slopes 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lepoil soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping dissected marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent. Steep sloping terrace sides have had the riser component replaced by a hillslope component.  Elevations are 12 to 183 meters (40 to 600 feet). These soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2085 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). Mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 325 days."
