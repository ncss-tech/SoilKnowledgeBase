  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlepete series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks. Littlepete soils are on flood-plain steps of glacial-valley floors and basin floors of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 920 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
