  "OVERVIEW": "The Lolo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Lolo soils are on stream terraces and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
