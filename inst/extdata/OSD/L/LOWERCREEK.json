The Corbett soils have a paralithic contact of weathered granodiorite at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Juniperbute soils have mollic colors and .3 percent organic carbon below the A horizon to a depth of 60 inches.  Sacheen soils have mollic colors to 12 inches and are loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand below the A horizon.  The Shellrock soils are loamy coarse sand throughout the profile, have 30 to 40 inches of precipitation and have a frost free period of 10 to 80 days.  The Sisters soils have 20 to 60 percent volcanic ash in the control section and 30 to 50 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section."

These soils formed in sandy alluvium outwash or eolian deposits.  The climate is characterized by cold winters; moist springs; moist falls; and dry, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches, most of which falls as snow or as rain late in fall or early in spring.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 125 days."
