  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 183 cm.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume to a depth of 100 cm and up to 50 percent below 100 cm.  Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically comprise 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments.  Unless limed, reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper 100 cm and ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid below.\nThe O horizon, where present, consists of slightly, intermediately, and/or highly decomposed organic material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Disturbed pedons have an Ap horizon that includes chroma of 3.  The A or Ap horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a thin Eg horizon below the A horizon.  It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture, structure, and consistence are like the underlying B horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Chroma of 3 and 4 are limited to subhorizons. Chroma of 1 or 2 is in some subhorizons within a 50 cm depth.  The horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has redoximorphic features that typically decrease in abundance with depth.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction, but may range to loamy sand at depth.  Some pedons have pockets or thin lenses of silt loam, loamy sand, or sand.  The horizon is massive or it has weak plates.  Consistence commonly is very friable or friable but some pedons have lenses or layers that are firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series currently in the same family.\nThe Fredon, Lamson, Lyme, Mansfield, Massena, Menlo, Neversink, Newstead, Raynham, Raypol, Red Hook, Ridgebury, Stissing, Sun, and Whitman series are similar soils in related families.  Fredon, Lamson, Red Hook, and Raynham soils formed in water sorted materials and are nonacid.  Lyme soils are in a frigid family. Mansfield, Menlo, and Whitman soils have a dense substratum and are very poorly drained.  The Massena, Newstead, and Sun soils are nonacid. Raypol soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Ridgebury and Stissing soils are nonacid and have a dense substratum. Neversink soils have rock fragments dominated by sandstone, siltstone, and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leicester soils are nearly level to gently sloping and are in low-lying depressional areas and drainageways of glaciated hills.  Slope commonly is less than 3 percent but the range includes 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in acid coarse-loamy till derived from granite, gneiss, and/or schist.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 13 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 910 to 1800 mm. The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 240 days."

The well drained Charlton and the moderately well drained Sutton soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Acton soils are sandy and moderately well drained.  Broadbrook, Essex, Montauk, and Paxton soils are well drained with a dense substratum.  Brookfield, Canton, Narragansett, and Stockbridge soils are well drained. Chatfield and Hollis soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm and 25 to 50 cm depths, respectively.  Georgia and Wapping soils are moderately well drained.  Gloucester soils are sandy and excessively drained.  Rainbow, Scituate, and Woodbridge soils are moderately well drained and have a dense substratum."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are wooded.  Some areas are in brushy unimproved pasture.  Cleared areas are used for hay or pasture.  Tree species include alder, gray birch, red maple, eastern hemlock, American elm, and spruce.  Shrub species include northern spicebush, winterberry, and silky dogwood.  Herb species include skunk cabbage, green false hellebore, sensitive fern, cinnamon fern, jewelweed, and water-tolerant sedges and rushes."
