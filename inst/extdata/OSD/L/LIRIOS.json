They are strongly or very strongly acid throughout.  Quartz crystals vary from none to many.  Base saturation by sum of cation ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Organic carbon content in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon varies from 0.6 to 0.9 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam and is nonsticky and slightly plastic.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 and higher.  It is clay or silty clay and consistence is slightly sticky and slightly plastic, clay films vary from few faint to many prominent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 10R with reddish yellow, yellowish brown or brownish yellow mottles.\nThe C horizons are silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam."

The Consumo, Consojo, Corozal, Corozo, Ingenio, Jagueyes, Maricao, Moca, Patillas and Rio Piedras series are similar soils in related families.  The Consumo, Maricao and Patillas soils have argillic horizons thinner than 16 inches.  The Consejo soils are yellower and finer textured throughout.  The Corozal soils are wetter and have low chroma mottles in the upper B horizons.  The Corozo soils have sandy surface layers.  The Ingenio and Jagueyes soils have lower CEC values, less than 24 meq/100 grams of clay."

The soil formed in fine over mucky-fine textured, very highly weathered residuum weathered from plutonic rocks, mainly granodiorite or quartz diorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 90 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F."
