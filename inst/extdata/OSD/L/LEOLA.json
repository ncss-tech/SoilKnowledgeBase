  "OVERVIEW": "The Leola series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash on outwash plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum. Redox accumulation typically are throughout the soil below the A horizon.

Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The dominant texture is sandy loam or the gravelly analog but subhorizons are loamy sand or the gravelly analog.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.
