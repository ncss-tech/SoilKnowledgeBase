  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 26 to 50 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent of the solum and substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum. Redox accumulation typically are throughout the soil below the A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation occur within a depth of 30 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The dominant texture is sandy loam or the gravelly analog but subhorizons are loamy sand or the gravelly analog.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or gravelly sand."

Near the generalized mesic-frigid line, the somewhat poorly drained Meehan soils and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Newson soils, both of which are classified frigid, are associated with the Leola soils.  The Meehan soils are on nearly level slopes and the Newson soils are in depressions or drainageways."

Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the substratum. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for some time in most years."
