  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 58 degrees F. and is above 47 degrees F. from early February until late December.  Soil below depth of 12 inches is usually moist in some part from about December 1 until June 1 and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  Gravel size rock fragments are 3 to 20 percent and larger rock fragments make up an additional 5 percent of the profile.  Texture throughout is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and the soil is neutral to medium acid.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent.  The A horizon is brown or grayish brown in 10YR hue.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent to a depth of 10 to 19 inches.  This horizon is massive or has granular structure and is soft or slightly hard.  The lower horizon is weathered granodiorite."

Francis, Neptune, and Wasatch soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Mottsville soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Shaver and Sheridan soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches.  Also, Shaver soils are coarse-loamy and Sheridan soils have mean annual temperature above 59 degrees F.  Sheephead soils have fractured micaceous schist at depths of less than 20 inches.  Tollhouse soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The La Posta soils are moderately sloping to very steep and are in hilly mountainous areas at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet. The soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches and comes in the winter.  Average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 170 to 225 days."
