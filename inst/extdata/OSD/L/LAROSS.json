  "OVERVIEW": "The Laross series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic tuff.  The Laross soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
