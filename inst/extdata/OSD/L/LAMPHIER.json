    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lamphier soils are on alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and alluvial drainageways in the mountainous areas. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent. The soils formed in local alluvium derived primarily from reddish brown sedimentary rock and conglomerate. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches with generally uniform precipitation occurring throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is 33 to 40 degrees F, and the frost-free season is 50 to 85 days.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 8,600 feet."
