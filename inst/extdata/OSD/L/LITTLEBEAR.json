  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to the sandy IIC horizon ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 10 to 30 percent in a majority of subhorizons of the control section and there is some subhorizon above depth of 20 inches that is at least four inches thick and contains at least 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the control section is usually sandy loam but clay averages 5 to 18 percent.  The lower and predominating portion of the control section is loamy sand or sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8  dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline and has 3 to about 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Littlebear soils are on alluvial fans or terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvial parent sediments.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 degrees F."
