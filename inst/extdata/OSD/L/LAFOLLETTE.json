    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is usually dry and is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days (cumulative).  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The upper mantle (depth to the discontinuity 2AC horizon) is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The upper mantle contains 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates, a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent and an acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.40 to 0.80 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.  It is neutral throughout.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent rock fragments with the upper part containing less than 15 percent and the lower part containing 35 to 60 percent.  The upper part of the particle-size control section contains 50 to 70 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 5 dry and chroma of 2 moist and 3 dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent clay (estimated).\nThe 2AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 moist and 6 dry and chroma of 3 moist and 4 dry.  It contains 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent clay (estimated).\nThe 2C and 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  The upper portion of the C horizon contains 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent clay and the lower part contains 60 to 80 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent clay.\nIn some pedons, there is a thin layer of welded tuff between the 2AC and the 2C horizons."

The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Mazama.\nThe 2AC and 2C, 3C material is unconsolidated alluvium from the Deschutes Formation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
