  "OVERVIEW": "The La Lande series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately\npermeable soils that formed in calcareous mixed sediments. These soils are on terraces, hills, alluvial fans and piedmont slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, with a marked summer maximum characterized by heavy thunderstorms of short duration. Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,300 feet."
