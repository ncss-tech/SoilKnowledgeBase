    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed calcareous mixed sediments derived principally from \"redbed\" formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian Age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, with a marked summer maximum characterized by heavy thunderstorms of short duration. Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,300 feet."
