  "OVERVIEW": "The Legray series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid and/or sedimentary rock. The Legray soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm (8 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
