    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 7 to 14 inches.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 6 to 13 inches.  The particle size control section contains less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 0 to 20 percent in the 2B horizon.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue ranging from 10YR to 2.5YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is commonly silt or silt loam but ranges to include loam and very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue ranging from 10YR to 2.5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam."

Glugulch soils lack silt loam textures in the upper part of the solum. Goodview soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle size control section. Olathe soils are coarser than very fine sandy loam in the upper part of the solum."

Liesnoi soils formed in a thin silty loess mantle overlying residuum from bedrock of various origins.  The climate is humid maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 110 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 1500 feet."

Mitkof soils are deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on concave slopes and in depressional areas.  Blaquirre soils are moderately deep soils on similar positions."
