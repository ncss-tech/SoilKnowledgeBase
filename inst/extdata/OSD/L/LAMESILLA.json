  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamesilla soils are on inset fans of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Horcado soils are sandy-skeletal, have thin mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Latierra soils are coarse-loamy, have thin mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Levante soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on narrow flood plains of valley floors.  Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on narrow beveled summits and shoulders of erosional fan remnants."
