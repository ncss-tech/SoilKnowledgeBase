  "OVERVIEW": "The Lowder series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and alpine glacial till from hard fine grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, moraines, swales and flood plain steps.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
