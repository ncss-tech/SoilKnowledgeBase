These soils contain free carbonates throughout. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. The clay percentage ranges from 12 to 27 percent.  Thin strata of coarser or finer texture are commonly present."

Leta soils occur on slightly higher areas of the flood plain. Myrick soils occur on similar landscapes and Parkville soils occur on slightly higher areas of the flood plain. Waldron soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a fine particle size control and are on slightly higher areas of the flood plain."
