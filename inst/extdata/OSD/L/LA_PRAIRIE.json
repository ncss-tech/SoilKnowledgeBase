  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to over 40 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  Channeled and nonflooded phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Ab horizons are in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Secondary carbonates, as threads or fine to coarse masses, are in the lower B horizon in some pedons.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Sandy clay loam is allowed below 40 inches.  The C horizon has faint or distinct redoximorphic concentrations in some pedons.  Some pedons below a depth of 40 inches contain strata with up to 5 percent rock fragments and textures of very coarse sand to clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are the Darnen, Delette, Everts, Frolic and Southhaven series.  Darnen soils are well drained, have a thicker solum and generally are deeper to carbonates.  They occur on moraines, formed in alluvium from till and are not subject to flooding.  Delette, Frolic and Southhaven soils do not have carbonates within 40 inches.  Everts soils have sandy textures below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  La Prairie soils are on level to gently sloping terraces, bottom lands and in swales of intermittent streams.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 15 to 23 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aastad, Barnes, Cashel, Fairdale, Forman, Gardena, LaDelle, Lamoure, Ludden, Svea, Wahpeton and Walsh soils.  Aastad, Barnes, Forman and Svea soils are on nearby till uplands and Gardena and Walsh soils are on nearby deltas, fans and lake plains.  These soils have a regular decrease in organic matter content with depth.  In addition, Barnes and Forman soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches in thickness and Gardena soils are coarse-silty.  Cashel, Lamoure and Ludden soils are on nearby lower lying bottom lands.   Cashel soils are somewhat poorly drained and have fine textures.  Lamoure soils are poorly drained and are fine-silty.  Ludden soils are poorly drained and have fine textures.  Fairdale and LaDelle soils are on similar positions as La Prairie soils.  Fairdale soils have fine stratification below the A horizon.  LaDelle soils are fine-silty.  Wahpeton soils are on higher lying levees and have fine textures."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is negligible to low depending on slope.  Permeability is moderate.  The soils are flooded for short periods when streams overflow.  A seasonal high water table is at depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time during the period of April through June."
