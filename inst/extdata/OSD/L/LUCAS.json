    "content": "REMARKS: Lucas was formerly classified as Typic Hapludalfs.\nThe loamy and sandy substratum phases that were mapped in earlier surveys have substrata at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). These phases will not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be correlated as new series during future modernization projects.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 63 cm (Bt horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 51 cm."
