  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lucas soils are on dissected areas on lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slopes commonly are 6 to 18 percent but range from 0 to 45 percent. The soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low. Permeability is slow or very slow."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Lucas was formerly classified as Typic Hapludalfs.\nThe loamy and sandy substratum phases that were mapped in earlier surveys have substrata at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). These phases will not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be correlated as new series during future modernization projects.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 63 cm (Bt horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 51 cm.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
