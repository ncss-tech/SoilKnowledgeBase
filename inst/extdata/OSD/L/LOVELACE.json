The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.\nThe A horizon is very pale brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown or light brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 6/4).  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C1 horizon (or upper part of the C horizon) is pale brown, brown or light brown (10YR 5/3, 6/3; 7.5YR 6/4).  The C2ca and C3ca horizons are sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Some pedons are weakly cemented but can be penetrated by auger or spade.  Some pedons below the C3ca horizon to depths of 60 inches are loamy sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lovelace soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 5 to 8 percent and elevation is 3,000 to 3,300 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources but mainly granitic rock.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches, falling mainly as rain in late autumn and winter though some occasionally falls as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 61 to 65 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 to 250 days."
