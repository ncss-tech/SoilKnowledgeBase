The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 15 to 26 inches.  The mollic epipedons is 10 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent clay.  Most pedons have a thin 1 inch layer on the surface that has a dry value of 6.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons are loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The upper part is noncalcareous with the lower part slightly to strongly calcareous.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe Bk and C horizons have 5 to 10 percent clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."
