  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The solum ranges from 20 to 35 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 7 to 15 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 0 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 2 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 10 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon.  It commonly is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist.  It is very gravelly loamy s and in some pedons.  It is 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostcreek soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, and toeslopes of hills and mountains.  These soils formed in alluvium and glacial till with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  Slops are 3 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Apex, Barnell, Louploup, Merkel, and Stapaloop soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Scoap and Stevens soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick, and Sanpoil soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 24 inches thick.  Barnellcreek  and Louploup soils are ashy over loamy, and Merkel and Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal. Donavan, Goldlake, and Stevens soils are mesic.  Sanpoil soils are poorly drained.  Barnellcreek and Goldlake soils are moderately well drained, and the other soils are well drained.   In addition, all of these soils, except the Barnellcreek, Goldlake, and Sanpoil soils, are dry in the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice."
