These soils do not have a densic contact within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches). In addition, Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, and Loudon soils have sola greater than 51 cm (20 inches) thick. Tarlton soils have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

The poorly drained Brookston and very poorly drained Kokomo soils have mollic epipedons and are in depressions or on nearly level areas. Celina soils have thicker sola but are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby soils have thicker sola and are on nearly level areas or on gentle slopes. The well drained Miamian soils have thicker sola and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Pyrmont soils are on lower topographic positions or on more gentle slopes."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and slow in the substratum."
