  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewisburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow to dense till. These soils formed in till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
