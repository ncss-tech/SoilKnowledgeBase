  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 45 inches. Bedrock is unconforming, at depths of 4 to 10 or more feet. Rock fragments of chert range from 10 to 30 percent in the solum and 20 to 35 percent in the C horizon. The soil is medium acid to neutral and acidity decreases with depth. Base saturation in the lower part of the C horizon is greater than 50 percent.\nThe A horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. They are silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 through 6, chroma of 0 through 2 and are mottled. BE and Bt horizons range from silt loam to silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. The Bx horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or their gravelly analogues.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2/5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chromas of 0 to 2. Fine earth texture is loam or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Frenchtown, Hasbrouck, and Towhee soils are in related families. The Frenchtown soils have an albic horizon and rock fragments dominated by sandstone. Hasbrouck soils have less than 10 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. The Towhee soils have 5 to 30 percent rock fragments dominated by diabase in the argillic horizon.\nThe Abbottstown, Ravenna, and Venango series are similar soils in related families. The Abbottstown, Ravenna, and Venango soils have chroma of 3 or more in the upper part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loysville soils are on colluvial footslopes, branches and in depressions. Slopes are concave to linear. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Loysville soils formed in colluvium from cherty limestones. The climate is temperate and humid with a mean annual temperature of 45 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches."

Other associates are the Albrights, Buchanan, Ernest, Laidig, and Monongahela soils, none of which have developed from limestone materials and all of which are better drained than Loysville soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon -- The zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon -- The zone from about 16 to 36 inches (Btg and Btxg horizons)\nFragipan horizon -- The zone from about 24 to 36 inches (Btxg horizon)\nTypic Aqualf feature -- Dominant chromas of less than 2 below the Ap horizon and slightly acid in the Cg horizon.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\n1/2009  the Loysville series was deactivated. This series was used in two survey areas. The type location was in Allegany County, MD, with a correlation date of 1968 (300 acres). It was not recorrelated with the update of this county.\nLoysville was listed as a minor component in the soil survey of Juniata and Mifflin Counties, PA (correlated 1975) in an Evandale map unit (Ev), resulting in about 45 acres.\nPrevious revision dates: 1/85; 12/2005-EDM, JTH, DLY\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
