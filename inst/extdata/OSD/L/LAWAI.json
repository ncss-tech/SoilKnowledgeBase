The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from weathered basic igneous rocks and soils weathered from basic igneous rocks and influenced by tropospheric dust.  The annual rainfall is 80 to 120 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., average January temperature is about 69 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 76 degrees F."
