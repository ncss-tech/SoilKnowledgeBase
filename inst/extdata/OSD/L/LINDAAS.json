  "OVERVIEW": "The Lindaas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial lake sediments or local alluvium from till.  These soils are in shallow depressions and on broad flats on glacial lake plains, till plains and moraines.  They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",
