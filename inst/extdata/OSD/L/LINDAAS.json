LE is less than 6 cm in the upper meter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay ranging from 35 to 60 percent clay.   It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Clean sand and silt grains coat faces of peds in some pedons.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon contains carbonates or distinct redox features or both.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has distinct or prominent redox features and is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  In some pedons clayey material is below a depth of 40 inches.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Jicarilla soils are somewhat poorly drained, formed in areas where precipitation is uniform throughout the year, and formed in alluvium from sandstone.  Mustinka soils are underlain by till containing rock fragments at depths of 20 to 50 inches."

The soils formed in calcareous silt loam, clay loam and silty clay loam glacial lake sediments or local alluvium from till.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 19 to 27 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 135 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 1600 feet."

Bearden, Colvin, Overly and Perella soils do not have argillic horizons and are fine-silty.  In addition, Bearden and Colvin soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches.  Bearden soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Overly soils are moderately well drained.  Enloe soils have albic horizons.  All the associated soils are above the Lindaas soils on the landscape."
