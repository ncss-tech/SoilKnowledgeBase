  "OVERVIEW": "The Lihen series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively or well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium, glaciofluvial, and eolian deposits that are in places over till or sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on stream terraces, dunes, sedimentary plains, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
