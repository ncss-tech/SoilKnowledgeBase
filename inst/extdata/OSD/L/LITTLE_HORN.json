  "REVDATE": "10/2006",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Little Horn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from limestone, quartzite, or sandstone. These soils are on mountains and foothills. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
