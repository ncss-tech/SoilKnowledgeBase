It is sandy loam and loamy sand and has weak or no structure.  It ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/1, 6/1, 6/2, 5/1; or 5Y 5/1.  Moist colors are 10YR 6/2, 5/4; or 5Y 5/2.  It is loamy fine sand to sand.  Fine stratification within the C horizon or coarse stratification between horizons is present.

The Carteret soils are very poorly drained and the profiles are continuously saturated.  Columbia soils are coarse-loamy.  Dello soils lack coarse stratification in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Hilmar soils have a contrasting sandy over loamy textures in the series control section."
