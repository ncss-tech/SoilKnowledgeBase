  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lino series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash or eolian sediments on outwash plains and valley trains.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 50 to 100 inches or more.  The series control section and C horizon do not have rock fragments.  Quartz comprises about 70 to 85 percent of the sand fraction.  Typically, the particle-size control section averages fine sand, but sand is within the range.  The content of coarse and very coarse sand ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or fine sand.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon ranging to as much as 6 inches in thickness with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It has few to many, faint to prominent redox features.  The reddish brown Fe concentrations commonly are weakly cemented.  Colors with chromas of 2 or less occur as either the matrix or as Fe depletions above a depth of 40 inches. The Bw horizon typically is fine sand, but sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the upper part is within the range.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has common or many redox features.  It is fine sand or sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid."

Aylmer, Poppleton, and Rushlake soils have pH greater than 6.0 in the series control section. Hiwood, Poppleton, and Redby soils are substantially drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Hiwood soils also contain more than 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Meehan and Rushlake soils have more than 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with increasing depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lino soils have slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on glacial outwash plains.  Slopes  range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in sandy sediments of glacial outwash or eolian origin.  The deposits are of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150. Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."

The poorly drained Blomford soils, the well drained Anoka soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Soderville soils are also closely associated in some places."
