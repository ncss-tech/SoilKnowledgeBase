  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series would qualify for a strongly contrasting family of clayey over ashy if such a class existed in Soil Taxonomy.  The mineralogy class of the upper part of the control section would be diatomaceous if the class was allowed in Mollisols, otherwise the class would be mixed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 2.5 to 20 inches (A1, A2, and 2AB horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 74 inches at certain times during normal years.\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (2AB, 2Bw1, 3Bw2, and 3C1 horizons and parts of the A2 and 3C2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A reference pedon of Lousecreek has partial characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S97OR-037-003 (pedon # 98P0141).  The pedon has two horizons sampled at depths of 4 to 12 and 12 to 17 inches.  Volcanic glass content was also determined locally on two horizons of the typical pedon by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
