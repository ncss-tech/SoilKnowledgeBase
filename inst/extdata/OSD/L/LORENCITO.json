  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lorencito series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale and siltstone.  Lorencito soils are on hills, pediments and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
