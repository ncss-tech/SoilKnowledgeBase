It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. It has 1 to 5 percent Fe/Mn 1-10mm rounded to well rounded concretions. It has few to common prominent black (10YR 2/1) manganese films on faces of peds. Reaction is moderately acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It is a silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. It has 1 to 5 percent Fe/Mn 1-10mm rounded to well rounded concretions. It has few to common prominent black (10YR 2/1) manganese films on faces of peds. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It is a silty clay loam or silty clay with 30 to 50 percent clay. It has 1 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 50 percent paragravel, and 0 to 15 percent paracobbles. It has 1 to 5 percent Fe/Mn 1-10mm rounded to well rounded concretions. It has few to common prominent black (10YR 2/1) manganese films on faces of peds.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Laurelwood soils are on hills with long, convex, slopes that are gently sloping to very steep and have gradients of 3 to 60 percent and elevations of 200 to 1,600 feet. The soils formed in homogeneous, silty, loess-like material deposited probably in the middle Pleistocene overlying fine textured nonconforming materials commonly weathered from members of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual rainfall is 45 to 60 inches. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cascade, Delena, Helvetia, Kinton, Kinton and Nekia soils. Cascade, Delena, and Kinton soils have fragipans, lack an argillic horizon and are on hills. In addition, Cascade soils are somewhat poorly drained, Delena soils are poorly drained and Kinton soils are moderately well drained. Helvetia soils are fine textured on lower footslopes. Nekia soils are fine textured and are 20 to 40 inches deep to basalt bedrock and are on foothills."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognize in the pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon from a depth of 0 to 11 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon from a depth of 23 to 52 inches Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons).\nNonconforming material from a depth of 52 to 72 inches (2C1 and 2C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section from a depth of 23 to 43 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nClassification revised 3/2000 to reflect addition of superactive CEC class based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nClassification revised 1/2005 to active CEC class based on laboratory data.\nPossibility exists that the Laurelwood concept is a Mollisol rather than Alfisol. Lab data collected to date (8 pedons) indicate 50% Alfisol and 50% Mollisol. Central concept of the series is located on a north slope and was likely forested in the past, which supports the Alfisol concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from 8 representative pedons with User Pedon ID #s 59OR067005, 59OR067006, 02OR067002, 02OR067003, 03OR071006, 03OR071007, 03OR071008, and 03OR071009.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
