  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The combined thickness of the organic layers exceed 51 inches.  In some pedons there is a surface covering of sphagnum moss up to 18 inches thick.  The layers in the surface tier consist dominantly of hemic materials, but in some pedons they are composed of fibric or sapric material.  Fibric horizons are dominantly sphagnum moss and have hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. These layers are derived from herbaceous plants and sphagnum moss. Structure in the surface tier is dominantly platy but is granular or massive in some pedons.  Layers within the control section have a hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 2 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 4.  Colors commonly become darker on brief exposure to air.  The subsurface and bottom tiers range from platy structure to massive. Reaction throughout the control section ranges from ultra acid to very strongly acid (pH less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride)."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pleasant Lake (T) and Citypoint series.  The Pleasant Lake soils formed in organic material derived from woody plants.  The Citypoint soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Closely related series are the Beseman, Carbondale, Carlisle, Dawson, Greenwood, Houghton, Lupton, and Rifle series.  Beseman soils have loamy mineral material within 51 inches of the surface and the Dawson soils have sandy material within 51 inches of the surface.  .  The Greenwood, soils consist dominantly of hemic materials.  The Carbondale, Carlisle, Houghton, Lupton and Rifle soils are less acid in the subsurface and bottom tiers.  In addition the Carlisle and Houghton soils are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Loxley soils are in depressions on moraines, lake plains, and outwash plains.  In some places they are in depressions on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 22 to 34 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees."

The excessively drained Rubicon and excessively drained Grayling soils, the moderately well drained Croswell soils, and somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils are nearby or border the Loxley soils.  The poorly drained Kinross and Roscommon soils are the most common adjacent soils.  The Dawson soils occupy similar landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.    The representative depth to wet soil moisture status is at the surface to 1 foot below the surface at some time throughout the year.  The representative depth of ponding is from 0 to 1.0 foot at some time throughout the year.  Surface runoff is negligible to medium.  Permeability ranges from moderately slow to moderately rapid."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Very little intensive use is made of these soils because of excess wetness, extreme acidity, and frost hazard.  Soil areas usually lack suitable drainage outlets.  Ground cover consists principally of blueberry, leatherleaf, sphagnum moss, and wintergreen. Trees are limited to a few scattered black spruce, jack pine, quaking aspen, and tamarack."
