  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavate series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils.  These soils  formed in alluvium and colluvium from igneous rocks on alluvial fans and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section in 6 out of 10 years.  They are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick. The combined thickness of the A and B horizons is 25 to 50 inches.  The soils are typically noncalcareous throughout, but in some pedons they are slightly calcareous below a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from sandy clay loam to clay loam and averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and between 30 and 60 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It ranges from sandy clay loam to loam or sandy loam and contains 5 to 25 percent rock fragments. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
