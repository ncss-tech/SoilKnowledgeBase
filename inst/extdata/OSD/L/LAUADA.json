  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 39 inches. Depth to paralithic contact (Cr) is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to lithic contact and hard bedrock (R) is more than 60 inches. Content of coarse fragments is less than 35 percent throughout. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the profile, except where surface layers have been limed. Visual estimations of mica content range from 10 to 30 percent in the A horizon, and 30 to 80 percent in the Bt and lower horizons. Generally, mica content increases with depth.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Value of 3 is limited to thin horizons. Soil materials in this horizon have a higher value when mixed to a depth of 7 inches. Textures in the fine earth fraction are loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Moderately eroded pedons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Textures in the fine earth fraction are clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. In some pedons, mottles occur in shades of red, yellow, or brown. The Bt horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, and may be mixed or mottled in shades of these colors. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, multicolored, high-grade metamorphic rock with a high mica content such as mica schist. It is partially consolidated, with a moderate to high excavation difficulty."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family. The Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, Fannin, Grover, Manor, Micaville, Mt. Airy, and Watauga series are in closely related families. All of these are very deep except the Brownwood, Micaville, and Mt. Airy series. Brownwood and Micaville soils lack an argillic horizon. Mt. Airy soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lauada soils are gently sloping to steep intermountain hills and strongly sloping to very steep, mountain summits and side slopes in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 3,000 feet. They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks having a high content of mica such as mica schist. Occasionally, interbedding with metasandstone occurs along margins or contacts with low-grade metamorphic formations. Slopes range commonly from 2 to 50 percent but can reach to 95 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 65 inches."

Brevard, Saunook, Tate, Thunder, and Tusquitee formed in colluvium, have less mica, and are in coves. Chestnut, Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, and Evard soils contain less mica. Additionally, Chestnut and Edneyville soils lack an argillic horizon. Clifton and Hayesville soils are in a fine particle-size class. Brasstown and Junaluska soils formed from low-grade metamorphic rock and occur along margins or contacts with high-grade metamorphic rock."

Virginia pine, shortleaf pine, and pitch pine are common in the central and southern portions of MLRA 130B. The understory includes flowering dogwood, American chestnut sprouts, flame azalea, blueberry, buffalo nut, huckleberry, mountain laurel, rhododendron, and sourwood. A small acreage is cleared and used for pasture and hayland."
