    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an O horizon present.  The soils are usually moist and are dry in the moisture control section less than 45 consecutive days during the summer following the summer solstice in most years. Depth to the paralithic contact and solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, including both channer shaped fragments (shaly textural modifiers) and angular or subangular fragments (gravelly or cobbly textural modifiers). The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay (see Remarks)  The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is medial loam with 18 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 10 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. It has moist bulk density less than 1.0 g/cm3, phosphate retention of 75 to 95 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 5 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is typically clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 15 to 55 percent gravel, 20 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 30 percent paragravel, and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is typically silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 15 to 55 percent gravel, 30 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones,  0 to 30 percent paragravel, and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 8 moist or dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is typically silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 15 to 45 percent gravel, 30 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 30 percent paragravel, and 0 to 20 percent paracobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lurnick soils occur on summits, ridgetops, shoulder slopes, and backslopes of mountains. Elevations are 1,800 to 4,100 feet. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in fine textured residuum and colluvium weathered from siltstone, shale and sandstone of the Tyee and Flournoy Formations. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 31 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 55 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 180 inches. The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."

Cruiser soils have andic soil properties, are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock, have hue of 5YR, and are medial. Luckiamute and Yellowstone soils are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Luckiamute soils are loamy-skeletal and have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Maryspeak soils are sandy-skeletal and greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Mulkey soils are in a medial family and have andic soil properties. Valsetz soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact, have andic soil properties, and are medial-skeletal. Yellowstone soils have andic soil properties and are medial-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 31 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - from a depth of 10 to 31 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nAndic feature - from a depth of 1 to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParalithic feature - weakly cemented, partially weathered siltstone bedrock at a depth of 31 inches (Cr horizon).\nThe current lower elevational range for this series of 1,800 feet is considerably lower than that of the geographically associated soils (3,000 to 4,100 feet). Upon further investigation and field observations in Polk County, the elevation range is likely to be revised so as to be consistent with all the geographically associated soils.\nThe official type location is located in Polk County and is currently considered as clayey-skeletal. The modal pedon for the adjacent Benton County is loamy-skeletal (based on lab data of 2.5 X 15-bar water = 30 percent clay) and is recognized as a taxadjunct to the series. All associated soils both at the official type location and in Benton County have less than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control sections.  In addition, there is a small extent of the Lurnick soil concept currently recognized and therefore, points to a need for further investigation as to the family particle-size class to use.\nClassification revised 9/03 from clayey-skeletal, isotic Typic Dystrocryepts to clayey-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts based on the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 8th Edition and supporting lab data.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
