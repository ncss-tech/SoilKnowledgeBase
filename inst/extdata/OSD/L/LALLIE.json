  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10-to 40-inch particle-size control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay.  Typically, it is layered or varved in the lower part and contains one or more buried horizons.  Some pedons have surface layers up to 15 inches thick consisting of recent sediments.  Some pedons have an O horizon.  Some pedons are nonsaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or clay.  These textures in the ponded phase may have a mucky modifier.  The A horizon is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons have higher chromas in the lower part.  It typically is silty clay loam or silty clay, but it is clay in some pedons.  It is massive or has weak or moderate grades of structure.  It does not have snail shell fragments and salts in some pedons.  It has gypsum in some pedons.  Layers of coarser materials are at depths below 40 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Silt loam strata up to 6 inches thick are in some pedons."

The soils formed in stratified clayey lacustrine or alluvial sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 23 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 105 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 3600 feet."
