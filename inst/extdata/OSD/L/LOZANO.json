Salinity in\nthe upper 3 feet of soil is less than 4 mmhos/cm and increases\nwith depth.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown\n(10YR 4/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1).  It is fine sandy loam or\nsandy loam and is friable moist, but is massive and hard dry.\nThe Bt horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown\n(10YR 4/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1).  Mottles are few to common, faint or distinct in shades of gray or brown.  It is sandy clay\nloam and neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon is brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light yellowish brown\n(10YR 6/4) with few to common, faint and distinct mottles in\nshades of gray, brown, and yellow.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay\ncontent of 25 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon is pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR\n7/3), or pink (7.5YR 7/4).  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  Accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from barely visible to about 5 percent by volume of weakly to strongly cemented\nconcretions and soft masses.

Lyford soils have less than 10 percent (absolute) clay increase from the\nA horizon to the Bt horizon, and lack prismatic structure.\nBrennan soils lack mottles of chromas of 2 or less within 30\ninches of the surface.  Delfina soils have secondary lime\noccurring below depths of 34 inches and lack prismatic structure.  Nueces soils have sandy epipedons more than 20 inches thick.\nVashti soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 72\ndegrees F."
