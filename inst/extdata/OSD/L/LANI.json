Lani soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over material weathered from granitic rock. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,700 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
