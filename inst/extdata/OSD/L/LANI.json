  "OVERVIEW": "The Lani series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from granite, gneiss, and schist. Lani soils are on backslopes and ridges of glaciated mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",
