  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of 6 to 16 inches usually becomes moist in mid-October or November and remains moist until the end of April.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees to 58 degrees F.  Organic matter is more than 1 percent at depth of 10 inches and less than 1 percent at depth of 20 inches.  Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the profile to a depth of 30 inches.  Small areas have O horizons of leaf and twig litter.  Pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent by volume, except for the horizon immediately above the paralithic contact which may range to 65 percent pebbles.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4).  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, strong brown, reddish brown, or reddish yellow (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 5/4, 6/6).  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  This horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nIn a few places is a C horizon with a color of brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown, or reddish yellow (10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 6/8).  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  This horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lompico soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  They formed in material weathered from sandstone, shale, conglomerate, and granodiorite at elevations from 400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is humid mesothermal having warm, dry but foggy summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F., average July temperature is 65 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 54 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 220 to 240 days."
