  "OVERVIEW": "The Lightning series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level or slightly concave soils are on flood plains mostly in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 15.6 degrees C. (60 degrees F.).",
