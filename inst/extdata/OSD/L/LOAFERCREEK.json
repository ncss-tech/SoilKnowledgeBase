  "OVERVIEW": "The Loafercreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic rocks, mainly greenschist. Loafercreek soils are on foothills. Slopes range from 1 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
