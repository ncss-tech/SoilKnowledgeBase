Disage soils have lithic contacts between 36 and 50 cm from the soil surface.  Grumblen soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 13 degrees C. and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Jung soils have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline argillic horizons and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Pipespring soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 12 degrees C.  Rocconda soils are calcareous in the argillic horizons and are dominated by channers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loomis soils are on rock pediments, plateaus, structural benches, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on summit or shoulder positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 115 days."
