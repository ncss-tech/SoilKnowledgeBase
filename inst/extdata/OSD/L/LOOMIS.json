  "OVERVIEW": "The Loomis series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Loomis soils are on rock pediments, plateaus, structural benches, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Grumblen soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 13 degrees C. and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Jung soils have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline argillic horizons and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Pipespring soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 12 degrees C.  Rocconda soils are calcareous in the argillic horizons and are dominated by channers."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 115 days."
