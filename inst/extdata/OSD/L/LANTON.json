  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanton series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils that are dark in the surface layer and to a depth of 24 inches or more.  These soils formed in alluvium on flood plains and in depressions.  They have moderately slow permeability in the solum and slow permeability in the clayey substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

The mollic epipedon is more than 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 0 to 3 and chroma of 0 to 2, except the Ap horizon also has chroma of 3 in some pedons.  The lower part has mottles in shades of gray or brown in most pedons.  The A horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam with the clay content commonly higher in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  The texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a Bg horizon with colors and textures like the Cg horizon."

Dekoven, Dunning, Lynnville and Roellen soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches in thickness.  Dekoven, Dunning, Godwin and Roellen soils, are all in clayey families.
