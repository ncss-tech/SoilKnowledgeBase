The mollic epipedon is more than 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 0 to 3 and chroma of 0 to 2, except the Ap horizon also has chroma of 3 in some pedons.  The lower part has mottles in shades of gray or brown in most pedons.  The A horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam with the clay content commonly higher in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  The texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a Bg horizon with colors and textures like the Cg horizon."

Hopco soils have less than 35 percent clay throughout the profile.  Wynona soils are slightly acid to strongly acid.  Dekoven, Dunning, Lynnville and Roellen soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches in thickness.  Dekoven, Dunning, Godwin and Roellen soils, are all in clayey families.  Egam and Lynnville soils are moderately well drained."
