Ankeny soils average more than 50 percent fine, medium, and coarse sand in the particle-size control section. Billard (T) soils contain less than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section and have a buried horizon. Eyota soils have in the lower part of the series control section subhorizons with less than 55 percent sand. Hanlon soils have a mollic epipedons more than 91 cm (36 inches) thick. Shellwood soils are less acid and have free carbonates in the control section. Tomall soils have carbonates in the C horizon."

Lomax soils formed in loamy to sandy alluvium or outwash. In some areas it the material has been reworked or redeposited by wind. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 14 degrees C (43 to 57 degrees F.); mean annual precipitation ranges from 585 to 1168 mm (23 to 46 inches), frost free days range from 155 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 480 meters (340 feet to 1570 feet) above sea level."

Illinois and Missouri are dropped from the states using the Lomax series. The Lomax soils in Missouri have been changed to the DeSioux Series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon -- the zone from the surface to a depth of 63 cm (25 inches); Ap, A1, and A2 horizons;\nCambic horizon -- the zone from 63 to 112 cm (25 to 44 inches); Bw1 and Bw2 horizons\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
