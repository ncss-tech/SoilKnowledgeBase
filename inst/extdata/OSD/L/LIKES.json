  "OVERVIEW": "The Likes series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy colluvium and alluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on very gently sloping valley flats or gently sloping to moderately steep valley sides.  Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in), and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
