The soil is usually moist and is dry within all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has a phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent; acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent; and 15-bar water on air-dried sample of 15 to 30 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 45 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is moderately acid or very strongly acid.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter.  It has 2 to 10 percent organic matter and decrease to below 7 percent below a depth of 12 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, cobbly loam, loam, or clay loam with apparent clay content of 18 to 30 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, wet summers.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches.  The frost free period is 50 to 100 days."
