    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  with an O horizon and full shade.  The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is fine sandy loam with less than 10 percent clay and averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, dominantly gravel.  The soils are extremely or very strongly acid in the E horizon, very strongly or strongly acid in the Bs1 horizon and strongly or medium acid in the Bs2 and C horizon.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Stones cover up to 0.1 percent of the surface.  Rock fragments range from 25 to 40 percent by volume.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the upper part and 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR in the lower part, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  The upper part ranges from firm to very firm and the lower part from friable to very friable.  Rock fragments range from 25 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 50 to 85 percent rock fragments, dominantly gravel."

Dinzer soils have an intermittent E horizon less than one inch thick and have a very friable or friable Bs horizon in hue yellower than 5YR.  Homestead and Tenex soils have a drier moisture regime than udic.  Homestead soils have a thin loess mantle.  Mt. Hood soils lack an upper spodic horizon having hue as red as 5YR or 2.5YR throughout and lack firm or very firm consistence.  Conto soils lack coarse fragments in the Bs horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium and glacial till weathered mostly from olivine andesites and olivine-bearing basalt rocks of the Cascade andesite formation mixed with volcanic ash.  The climate is humid and cool.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 145 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 29 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 30 days."
