  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynden series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and glacial outwash.  Lynden soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Thickness of volcanic ash influence and depth to the 2CB LYNDEN horizon is 14 to 24 inches.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  By weighted average the control section has 0 to 15 percent fine pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  Some pedons have an A2.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe 2CBs horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand, coarse sand, or sand.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is variegated, but dominantly 10YR or 2.5Y loamy sand, medium sand, or coarse sand."

In addition, Winston soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Lynnwood soils are sandy throughout the spodic horizon.  Nargar soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section."

The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and sandy glacial outwash.  Lynden soils are in a marine climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 35 degrees F; mean July temperature is 63 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

Edmonds and Woodlyn soils have a spodic horizon and an aquic moisture regime.  Fishtrap and Pangborn soils are Histosols.  Hale soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Kickerville soils are coarse-loamy.  Tromp soils are weakly cemented and are mottled below 20 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to sandy, mixed mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Laboratory data are available on this soil (Sample S81WA-073-14).  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches, and a spodic horizon from 8 to 30 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does have micro morphology, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized or larger pellets."
