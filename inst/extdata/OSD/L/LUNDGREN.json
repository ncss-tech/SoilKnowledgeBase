  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are intermittently moist and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 90 to 110 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the glacial outwash material is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 85 to 100 percent throughout the profile.  The particle size control section contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregate in the very fine sand fraction.  Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The 15-bar water on both dried and undried samples is 7 to 12 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments with the solum containing 0 to 30 percent gravel and the substratum containing 40 to 65 percent gravel and cobbles.  The pumice sand content (.5 mm to 2 mm) of the solum ranges from 20 to 60 percent.  Reaction is neutral throughout.   Field estimated clay content of the solum is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It contains  20 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam with 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments range from 40 to 65 percent."

Laidlaw soils contain less than 5 percent gravel throughout the solum and have 5 to 30 hard firm silica nodules. Wanoga soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Ermabell soils are on stream terraces, have an ash mantle consisting of fine sand or loamy fine sand and a substratum at a depth of 40 inches or more which is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand."

The soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial outwash deposits.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
