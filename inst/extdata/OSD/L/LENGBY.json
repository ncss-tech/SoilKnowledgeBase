The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with dry value of 6 or more.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E/B, B/E, or EB horizon.  The elluvial part is less than 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with subhorizons of silty clay loam in some pedons.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is stratified sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, and silt loam.  Stratification is variable but the sandy textures are dominant below a depth of 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Bonfri, Elmark (T), Fairport, Gateson, Lumpgulch (T), and Rule (T) soils have a lithic or paralithic contact beginning within depths of 20 to 40 inches.   Elbeth, Ferball (T), Onaway, and Plome soils do not have carbonates or stratified materials within the series control section.  Bondoe (T), Haugan, Foreleft, Lakoa, and Regnaps, soils are dry in some or all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  Nebish and Snellman soils do not have stratified material within the series control section."
