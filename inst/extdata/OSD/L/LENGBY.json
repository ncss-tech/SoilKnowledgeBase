  "OVERVIEW": "The Lengby series consists of very deep, well drained soils, that formed in stratified deposits on till plains, outwash plains, and lake plains under forest vegetation.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

The elluvial part is less than 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with subhorizons of silty clay loam in some pedons.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.
