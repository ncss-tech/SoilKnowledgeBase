  "OVERVIEW": "The Lotuspoint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains, hills, ridges, breaklands, and canyonsides. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary bedrock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 32 inches.",
