Elevations range from 2,080 to 4,000 feet in East Benewah and Shoshone Counties and up to 4,950 feet in West Benewah County. The climate is warm, subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches. The frost-free period is from 100 to 140 days."
