  "OVERVIEW": "The Lennep series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, eolian deposits or residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are nearly level to moderately sloping and are mainly on fans, terraces and foot slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 45 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick, and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The hue for the whole soil is 10YR through 5Y.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and value of 2 or 3.  Some pedons lack the thin A2 on the surface and have A1 horizons with granular structure and do not have coatings of clean sand and silt grains on faces of peds.\nThe A&B horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  Clean sand and silt grains may give crushed soil color value of one-half to one unit lighter.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons lack an A&B horizon but have an A12 horizon that has weak or medium prismatic structure.  Some pedons have clean sand and silt coatings on faces of prisms.  Some pedons lack a B&A horizon but have a B1t horizon with blocky or prismatic structure with thick coatings of sand and silt grains on vertical faces of peds.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay or silty clay and has 45 to 60 percent clay.  The estimated exchangeable sodium ranges from 7 to 10 percent in the upper part to more than 15 percent in the lower part.  The structure is medium or strong prismatic and the reaction ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have thick coatings of silt and sand on the vertical faces of peds in the upper part of the horizon.  The B3 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay or silty clay.  Some pedons lack gypsum or other salt crystals in this horizon.\nThe C horizon ranges from sandy clay loam through clay.  Some pedons lack gypsum crystals in the upper part of the C horizon.  Some pedons have shale at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The estimated exchangeable sodium is 15 to 25 percent."
