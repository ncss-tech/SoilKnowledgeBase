  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 degrees to 46 degrees F.  The noncalcareous portion of the solum is 12 to 26 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick, and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The hue for the whole soil is 10YR through 5Y.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and value of 2 or 3.  Some pedons lack the thin A2 on the surface and have A1 horizons with granular structure and do not have coatings of clean sand and silt grains on faces of peds.\nThe A&B horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  Clean sand and silt grains may give crushed soil color value of one-half to one unit lighter.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons lack an A&B horizon but have an A12 horizon that has weak or medium prismatic structure.  Some pedons have clean sand and silt coatings on faces of prisms.  Some pedons lack a B&A horizon but have a B1t horizon with blocky or prismatic structure with thick coatings of sand and silt grains on vertical faces of peds.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay or silty clay and has 45 to 60 percent clay.  The estimated exchangeable sodium ranges from 7 to 10 percent in the upper part to more than 15 percent in the lower part.  The structure is medium or strong prismatic and the reaction ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have thick coatings of silt and sand on the vertical faces of peds in the upper part of the horizon.  The B3 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay or silty clay.  Some pedons lack gypsum or other salt crystals in this horizon.\nThe C horizon ranges from sandy clay loam through clay.  Some pedons lack gypsum crystals in the upper part of the C horizon.  Some pedons have shale at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The estimated exchangeable sodium is 15 to 25 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lennep soils are nearly level to moderate sloping and are on fans, terraces, foot slopes and mantled uplands at elevations of 2,200 to 4,300 feet.  They formed in deep water transported sediment or eolian deposits of clay, clay loam and silty clay loam or deep residuum of these textures over shale.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 18 inches, most of which falls in spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F.  The (32 degrees F.) growing season is 105 to 135 days."
