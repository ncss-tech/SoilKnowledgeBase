In at least one subhorizon within 30 inches of the soil surface, the level of aluminum saturation is 20 percent or more. Brittle bodies near the contact of loess and Coastal Plain sediments ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Sand content ranges from 15 to 20 percent fine and coarse sand in the particle size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Where the color value is less than 3, the thickness is less than 6 inches. Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.  Clay content commonly is 20 to 30 percent, but ranges from 18 to 34 percent.  The sand fraction is mainly very fine sand.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2Bt/E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. The E part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.

Addielou has a ochric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Allen soils have more than 20 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section.  Avilla, Etowah, Ironcity, Minvale, Nella, and Octavia soils have fragments of sandstone or chert in the Bt horizon.  Bama and Pikeville soils do not have lithologic discontinuities within the solum.  In addition Pikeville soils have gravelly Bt horizons.  Dubach, Holston, Leesburg, Noboco, and Warnock soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the Bt horizons.  Ruston soils are bisequal.  Ora and Tangi soils have fragipans.  Lexington soils have mixed mineralogy and are Alfisols.  Smithdale soils are Hapludults."

Guyton, Ouachita, and Ochlockonee soils are on floodplains. Also, Guyton soils are poorly drained. Ruston soils are on similar positions as Lytle soils. Smithdale soils are on steeper side slopes."
