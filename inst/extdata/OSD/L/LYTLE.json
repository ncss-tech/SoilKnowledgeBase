  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid throughout the solum, except in areas that have been limed. In at least one subhorizon within 30 inches of the soil surface, the level of aluminum saturation is 20 percent or more. Brittle bodies near the contact of loess and Coastal Plain sediments ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Sand content ranges from 15 to 20 percent fine and coarse sand in the particle size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Where the color value is less than 3, the thickness is less than 6 inches. Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.  Clay content commonly is 20 to 30 percent, but ranges from 18 to 34 percent.  The sand fraction is mainly very fine sand.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2Bt/E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. The E part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the 2Bt/E horizon is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2B't horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay. Most pedons have few to many pockets of sand or loamy sand in shades of brown or yellow."

Addielou has a ochric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Allen soils have more than 20 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section.  Avilla, Etowah, Ironcity, Minvale, Nella, and Octavia soils have fragments of sandstone or chert in the Bt horizon.  Bama and Pikeville soils do not have lithologic discontinuities within the solum.  In addition Pikeville soils have gravelly Bt horizons.  Dubach, Holston, Leesburg, Noboco, and Warnock soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the Bt horizons.  Ruston soils are bisequal.  Ora and Tangi soils have fragipans.  Lexington soils have mixed mineralogy and are Alfisols.  Smithdale soils are Hapludults."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 55 to 63 inches, and  average annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 68 degrees F."

Fluker soils have a fragipan and are on local stream terraces adjacent to drainageways. Tangi soils have fragipans and are on less sloping parts of the landscape. Guyton, Ouachita, and Ochlockonee soils are on floodplains. Also, Guyton soils are poorly drained. Ruston soils are on similar positions as Lytle soils. Smithdale soils are on steeper side slopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Family classification changed from fine-silty to fine-loamy with this revision of the series. These soils were formerly mapped as Lexington soils. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon...........0 to 11 inches (Ap and E).\nArgillic horizon..........11 to 81 inches (Bt1, Bt2,\nBt3, 2Bt/E, 2B't1, 2B't2, 2B't3).\nLithologic discontinuity...the contact between the loess\nand Coastal Plain material at about 38 inches.  The\nsand fraction in the 28 to 38 inch zone is mainly very\nfine sand.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data on the typifying pedon was obtained from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, NSSC, sample S90LA-003-002.  Additional data from NSSC, sample S89LA037-91.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
