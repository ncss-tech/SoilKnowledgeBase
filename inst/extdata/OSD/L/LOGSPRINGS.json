    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt is 20 to 30 inches. The particle-size control section is 20 to 27 percent clay in the upper part and 40 to 50 percent clay in the lower part.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It is estimated to have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 25 percent clay and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is estimated to have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.15 to 0.35 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.\nThe 3Bt3 horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It contains 60 to 70 percent gravel.\nThe 4BCt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Logsprings soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping concave areas on benches.  The soil formed in alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2600 to 2800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
