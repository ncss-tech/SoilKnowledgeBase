  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Logsprings series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on concave areas of benches.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt is 20 to 30 inches. The particle-size control section is 20 to 27 percent clay in the upper part and 40 to 50 percent clay in the lower part.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It is estimated to have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 25 percent clay and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.
