  "OVERVIEW": "The Loslobos series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from mixed unconsolidated sediments.  Loslobos soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 40 to 100 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
