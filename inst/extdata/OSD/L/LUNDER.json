  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lunder series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  Lunder soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
