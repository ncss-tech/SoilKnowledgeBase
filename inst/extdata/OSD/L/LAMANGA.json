  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamanga series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvial material.  Lamanga soils are on flood plains and old alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Content increases with depth and the IIC horizon contains as much as 35 percent gravel in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Structure is weak to moderate coarse prismatic, or weak to moderate medium to coarse subangular blocky. ph ranges from 6.1 to 8.4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR."
