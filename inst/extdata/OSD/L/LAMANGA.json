Content increases with depth and the IIC horizon contains as much as 35 percent gravel in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Structure is weak to moderate coarse prismatic, or weak to moderate medium to coarse subangular blocky. ph ranges from 6.1 to 8.4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR."
