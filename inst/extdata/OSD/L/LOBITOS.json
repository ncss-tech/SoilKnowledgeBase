  "OVERVIEW": "The Lobitos series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed on moderately hard sandstone and shale.  Lobitos soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 24 to 40 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from June until late October or early November and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments of angular pieces of shale and sandstone include up to 30 percent by volume, with horizons below the A containing the greater amounts.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, dark gray and very dark grayish brown (10YR 5/2, 4/2, 4/1, and 3/2).  It is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or light clay loam.  Angular rock fragments of gravel size range up to 15 percent by volume.  Structure is weak or medium granular or subangular blocky.  Reaction is slightly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is light olive brown, brown or pale brown (2.5Y 5/4, 10YR 5/3, 6/3).  It is clay loam or silty clay loam modified by 10 to 35 percent gravel size angular shale fragments."

Colma, Los Osos, McCoy and Miramar have paralithic contacts.  Colma soils have less than 30 percent clay in their argillic horizons.  Los Gatos soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR hue in the argillic horizon.  Los Osos soils have more than 35 percent clay in their argillic horizon and are thermic.  McCoy and Miramar soils are pachic and McCoy soils are thermic."

The climate is subhumid to mesothermal and has warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature is about 48 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 270 to 300 days."
