These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvial and residual from granitic rocks. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
