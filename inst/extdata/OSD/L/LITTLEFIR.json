  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to shale or interbedded shale and sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Due to the irregular boundary between the lower Bt or BC horizon and the underlying tilted bedrock, it is extremely variable within short distances. Reaction ranges from slightly to strongly acid in the A, E, BA or BE horizons and from moderately acid to very strongly acid in the B and BC horizons. Sandstone, novaculite, quartzite or chert\nfragments less than 3 inches in diameter and shale fragments less than 6 inches in length range from about 5 to 60 percent by volume in the A, E, BA or BE horizons; 0 to 35 percent by volume in upper Bt horizons and 15 percent to 75 percent by volume in the lower Bt and BC horizons. Sandstone, quartzite, and novaculite fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 40 percent by volume in the A, E, BA, and BE horizons. Sandstone and novaculite fragments greater than 10\ninches in diameter range from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. A horizons with value of 2 or 3 are less than 6 inches thick. Textures is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their channery, very channery, gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or stony analogs.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their channery, very channery, gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6 or 8 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 or 6, or value of 5 and chroma of 6 or 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their channery, very channery, gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs.\nThe upper Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some pedons contain iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown, yellow and red. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their gravelly or channery analogs.\nThe lower Bt and BC horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, and iron accumulation and depletions in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray. Some do not have a dominant matrix hue and are varigated in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray. Iron depletions in shades of gray are more than 24 inches below the top of the argillic. Texture is channery silty clay, channery clay, channery silty clay loam, channery clay loam, or their very channery,\nextremely channery, gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs. Some pedons contain lenses of soft sandstone that extend up into the lower horizons.\nThe Cr horizon is soft weathered shale bedrock, or interbedded shale and sandstone or siltstone bedrock in various shades of black, olive, gray, brown, red, and\nyellow. The beds have a dip of more than 20 degrees from horizontal. Some pedons contain lenses or fragments of quartzite that are interbedded between shale and\nsandstone beds or plates."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Littlefir soils are on level to steep hills and ridges within valleys of the Ouachita Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in residuum from tilted, fractured, and folded shale or interbedded shale and sandstone or siltstone dominantly of Ordovician through Mississippian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches with the highest amount being distributed in January to May. Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bengal, Bismarck, Bonnerdale, Carnasaw, Ceda, Clebit, Dela, Kenn, Mazarn, Mena, Nashoba and Sherless series. Bengal soils occur on colluvial uplands and have a lithologic discontinuity in the solum and are well drained. Bismarck soils, which are on similar landscapes, have a 10 to 20 inch solum and are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Bonnerdale soils, which occur in drainageways and concave uplands, are in a\ncoarse-loamy particle-size class and are somewhat poorly drained. Carnasaw soils are on similar landscapes and have a 40 to 60 inch solum and are well drained. Ceda soils, which are on narrow upland flood plains, are greater than 60 inches deep and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size class section. Clebit soils, which occur on similar landscapes, have a 10 to 20 inch solum over hard sandstone bedrock and are in a loamy-skeletal particle- size class. Dela soils, which are on flood plains, are more than 60 inches deep and in a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Kenn soils, which are on flood plains, are well drained and in a fine-loamy particle-size class.\nMazarn soils, which are in upland drainageways and depressional areas, are in a fine-loamy particle-size class and are somewhat poorly drained. The Mena soils, which are on strath terraces, have a solum deeper than 60 inches. Nashoba soils, which are on similar landscapes, have a 20 to 40 inch solum over hard sandstone bedrock, and are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Sherless soils, which occur on similar landscapes, have a 20 to 40 inch solum over soft sandstone bedrock and are in a fine-loamy particle-size class."
