The soils formed in stratified lacustrine deposits derived from diatoms, volcanic ash and extrusive igneous rock.  Elevations are from 4,000 to 4,100 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 to 12 inches.  Snowfall in 10 to 20 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 29 degrees F and the average July temperature is about 66 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 50 to 80 days."
