  "OVERVIEW": "The Lyme series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy melt-out till on hills and mountains in glaciated uplands. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and moderately high to very high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1180 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
