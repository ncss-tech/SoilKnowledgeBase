    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 38 to 91 cm.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Texture of the fine earth fraction of the mineral solum is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Texture of the fine earth fraction of the mineral substratum is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have loamy sand or loamy coarse sand textures below 75 cm. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent of the mineral solum and from 10 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Unless limed, reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout. Consistence is very friable or friable when moist.\nThe O horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 0 to 2, and consists of slightly, intermediately, and/or highly decomposed organic material.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Dry value is 5 or 6.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon that has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 0 to 2.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 1 to 4."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lyme soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping areas in slightly concave areas and shallow drainageways of glaciated uplands. The soils formed in late, Wisconsin aged melt-out till derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The Mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual soil temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berkshire, Marlow, Monadnock, Peru, Skerry, and Sunapee soils. The Lyme soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Sunapee soils and the well drained Monadnock and Berkshire soils. the well drained Marlow soils and the moderately well drained Peru and Skerry soils formed in lodgment till.  The excessively drained Colton, well drained Adams, moderately well drained Croghan, and somewhat poorly to poorly drained Moosilauke and Naumburg soils are nearby soils that formed in water sorted sands and gravel."
