  "OVERVIEW": "The Lapham series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. Lapham soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
