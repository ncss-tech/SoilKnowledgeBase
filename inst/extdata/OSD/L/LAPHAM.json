    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lapham soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,460 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
