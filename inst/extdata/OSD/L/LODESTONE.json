  "OVERVIEW": "The Lodestone series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from calcareous shale and limestone. Lodestone soils are on hills on islands. Slopes range from 20 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F (17 degrees C).",

The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-August to mid-November (about 90 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nThe particle size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.\nReaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nDepth to carbonates ranges from 8 to 40 inches (20 to 102 centimeters).\nDepth to bedrock is 22 to 35 inches (55 to 90 cm).\nCracks wider than 5 mm extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches (50 cm). The cracks close some time in December to March for 60 to 90 consecutive days.\nThe A horizons dry color is 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 3/1. Moist color is 10YR, 2/2, 2/1.\nEffervescence is none or slight\nClay percentages range from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe Bkss1 and Bss1 horizons dry color is 10YR 4/2, 3/1, 2/1, 2.5Y 6/4, 4/6, 4/4.
