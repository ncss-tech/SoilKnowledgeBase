Rock fragments range from 15 to 25 percent in the A horizon; 20 to 35 percent within the upper twenty inches of the Bt horizon and 25 to 40 in the lower part of the Bt horizon; and 25 to 50 percent in the C horizon. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 2 or 3 moist. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline and ranges from 6 to 14 inches thick.\nThe BAt and Bt1 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry. It is dominantly gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam, but is very gravelly clay loam in the lower part in some pedons.

Bly soils are influenced to some extent by ash, and reaction is usually slightly acid in the Bt horizon and not slightly alkaline in any part.  Carey Lake soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and also contain relict mottles from 42 to 72 inches that were evidence of a high water table before a permanent change in drainage.  Dunford are 20 to 40 inches deep to fractured andesite bedrock.  Hades and Krueger soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments within the particle size control section.  Hurryback soils contain less than 20 percent rock fragments in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Mahogan soils are 30 to 40 deep to hard extrusive igneous bedrock.  Marotz soils are formed in glacial drift influenced by loess and have buried argillic horizons.  Moffspring soils are moderately well drained and have a seasonal high water table at 3 to 6 feet from April to June.  Nagle soils are calcareous at depths of 17 to 22 inches.  Sag soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to slightly weathered fractured basalt bedrock.  Strom soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a water table at 24 inches in the spring and recedes to below 50 inches in late summer and autumn.  Tusk soils have mollic epipedons of less than 35 inches."

These soils formed in residuum and alluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost free period is 70 to 100 days. The mean summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches."
