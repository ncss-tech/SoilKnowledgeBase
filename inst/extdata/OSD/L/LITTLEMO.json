The depth to horizons with greater than 35 percent rock fragments commonly is between 25 to 38 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam and is medium acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam and is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 35 percent.

It is sandy clay loam, coarse sandy loam, loam or sandy loam containing 15 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Textures of loamy coarse sand and loamy sand are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Littlemo soils are on level to moderately sloping fans and high terraces of the Little Missouri River.  The soils are on plane or slightly concave positions.  Slopes typically are less than 4 percent, but range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soil formed in loamy alluvium underlain by stratified loamy sediments containing appreciable amounts of gravel.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation from 13 to 16 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

Chanta, Kremlin, and Subwell soils are on similar landscapes.  Chanta soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Subwell soils are loamy-skeletal. Boxwell and Rhame are on adjacent side slopes.  They have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cabbart and Tinsley soils are on crests of hills and steep slopes on uplands.  Cabbart soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  Tinsley soils have sand and gravel at depths of 7 to 14 inches.  Lonna soils are on fans or foot slopes.  They do not have a mollic epipedon."
