Brinnum soils also have ochric epipedons and are located in swales of flood plains.  Logan soils are located in active stream drainages.  Langless soils also have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and are positioned on poorly drained areas of the flood plain."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 1.5 and 3.5 feet (shallow or moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between October and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."
