  "OVERVIEW": "The Lagonot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Lagonot soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
