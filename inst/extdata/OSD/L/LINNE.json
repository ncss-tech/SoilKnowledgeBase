  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F., and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 4 to 12 inches usually is dry all of the time from May until November and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Except for transitional horizons to the paralithic contact, the soil is clay loam or silty clay loam throughout with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Many pedons are moderately high in silt and very fine sand.   The profile is weakly to strongly calcareous and is particularly effervescent in the lower part.  In some pedons the uppermost few inches may not effervesce.  During the summer, cracks 1/4 to 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or more but intersecting slickensides are lacking.  Shale or mudstone fragments usually make up 1/2 to 5 percent of the soil volume, but the amount ranges up to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is gray, dark gray or very dark gray with chroma closer to 1 than 2.  It may have chroma of 2 below depth of about 20 inches.  It contains 2 to 6 percent organic matter in the upper part that decreases regularly with increasing depth and is 1 to 2 percent to a depth of 21 to 35 inches.  This horizon has moderate or strong granular or subangular blocky structure or weak or moderate angular blocky or weak prismatic structure.  It contains few to many thin filaments of lime in the lower part.\nThe lower part of the profile is an AC, C or Cca horizon or some combination of these horizons.  They have value of 6 through 8 and are fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Salinas and San Benito series in the same family and the Nacimiento, Shedd, Sorrento and Zaca series.  Salinas, San Benito and Sorrento soils lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Nacimiento and San Benito soils are brownish with a chroma of 2 or 3 and San Benito soils are not calcareous in the surface horizons.  Shedd soils lack mollic epipedons.  Zaca soils have more than 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Linne soils are on mountainous uplands and foothills.  Elevations are 100 to 2,200 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from light gray or white, fairly soft shale, and sandstone.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 24 inches.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees to 55 degrees F., average July temperature is 67 degrees to 79 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 55 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is 200 to 330 days."

Los Osos soils have a fine textured argillic horizon.  Santa Lucia soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments and a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent."
