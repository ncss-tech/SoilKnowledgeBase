Apperson, Kenoma, Parisian, and Summit series are moist for longer periods of time and have a solum greater than 51 cm (20 inches).  Durant, Foraker, and Tabler soils have a solum greater than 20 inches thick.  Ledru and Graham soils are dry for longer periods of time.  In addition, Ledru and Speck soils have mixed mineralogy.  Purves, Talpa, and Tarrant soils do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, the Talpa soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section, and the Tarrant soils have more than 35 percent fragments larger than 2 mm.  Speck soils have mixed mineralogy.  Tarpley soils have an argillic horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and formed over cretaceous material in a warmer climate than 18 degrees C (64 degrees F)."

These soils formed in material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is moist humid or humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1168 mm (37 to 46 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.8 to 17.7 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F).  Elevation is 165 to 305 meters (541 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 80."
