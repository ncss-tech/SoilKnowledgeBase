  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 10 to 20 inches deep over limestone bedrock.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to calcic horizon is 7 to 16 inches thick. Rock fragments are mainly limestone flagstones, channers or cobbles.   The calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 60 percent, including coarse fragments less than 20 millimeters.  The mean annual soil temperature at the top of the bedrock ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section for less than 80 consecutive days during the 120 days after the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline and is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 40 percent.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist.  It is clay loam or loam with 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Clay content is 18 to 30 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 60 percent.  It is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and shale.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. and the freeze-free period is 70 to 120 days."
