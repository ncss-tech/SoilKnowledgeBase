The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Mean winter is 40 to 45 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum has andic soil properties with 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 30 to 50 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.5 percent.  The solum has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 4, 6, or 8 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely medial gravelly loam.  It has 10 to 25 percent organic matter."
