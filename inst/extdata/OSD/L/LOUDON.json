Celina soils have sola less than 102 cm (40 inches) thick. Eudy soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Hartville soils formed in alluvium or colluvium and do not have glacial erratics within the series control section. Jerktail soils formed in colluvium and residuum and do not have glacial erratics within the series control section. Tarlton soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loudon soils are on glaciated uplands near the margin of the Illinoian till sheet. They are on broad interfluves, narrow beveled ridges below broader interfluves. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of loess 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches) thick and the underlying till and residuum from interbedded calcareous shale and thin strata of limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 112 cm (38 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cynthiana, Eden, Edenton, Fairmount, Faywood, Grayford, Jessup, Morrisville, Opequon, and Rossmoyne soils. Cynthiana, Eden, Fairmount, Faywood, and Opequon soils commonly are on steeper slopes in unglaciated areas, and where limestone is more dominant. The well drained Edenton soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on backslopes and upper shoulder positions, typically on more sloping areas. The well drained Grayford soils commonly are on areas dominated by limestone, contain less clay, and have lower base saturation. The well drained Jessup soils are in a toposequence with Loudon soils and are on shoulder positions or on narrow, beveled interfluves. The Morrisville soils have iron depletions below the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic and are on backslopes and shoulder slopes. Rossmoyne soils are on interfluves having a thicker deposit of till and have a fragipan."
