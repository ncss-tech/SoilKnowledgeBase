  "OVERVIEW": "The Loudon series consists of deep or very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a mantle of loess and the underlying till and residuum from calcareous gray shale and thin strata of limestone. These soils are on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

Cynthiana, Eden, Fairmount, Faywood, and Opequon soils commonly are on steeper slopes in unglaciated areas, and where limestone is more dominant. The well drained Edenton soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on backslopes and upper shoulder positions, typically on more sloping areas. The well drained Grayford soils commonly are on areas dominated by limestone, contain less clay, and have lower base saturation. The well drained Jessup soils are in a toposequence with Loudon soils and are on shoulder positions or on narrow, beveled interfluves. The Morrisville soils have iron depletions below the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic and are on backslopes and shoulder slopes. Rossmoyne soils are on interfluves having a thicker deposit of till and have a fragipan."
