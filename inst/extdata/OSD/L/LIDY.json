Holsine soils have thick very fine sandy loam or silt loam layers below depths of 9 to 16 inches.  Malm soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over basalt.  Matheson soils have a B horizon.  McCaleb soils have more than 40 percent carbonates in the control section.  Medicine Lodge soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section."

The soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits with a high percentage of limestone gravel.  The semiarid climate has a frost-free period of 80 to 115 days and an average annual precipitation of 8 to 11 inches.  Maximum precipitation falls in May and June."
