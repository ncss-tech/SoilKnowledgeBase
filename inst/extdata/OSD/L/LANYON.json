  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanyon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of lacustrine sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are in broad depressions within the late Wisconsin glacial drift plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
