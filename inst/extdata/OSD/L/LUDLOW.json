  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches and typically corresponds to the depth to the dense substratum. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet. Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent by volume in the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the substratum. Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically makeup 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry value is 6 or more. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. The Ap or A horizon is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It has iron depletions within a depth of 12 to 24 inches. The Bw horizon is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak subangular blocky structure or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very\nfriable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon below the B horizon. It has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Typically, it is coarser-textured than the overlying B horizon.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It commonly has redoximorphic features. Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The horizon has weak or moderate, medium to very thick plates, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ludlow soils are nearly level to strongly sloping and are on till plains, hills, and drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in acid till derived mostly from reddish sandstone, shale, and conglomerate with some basalt. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52\ndegrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 130 to 185 days."

Berlin soils are on lacustrine terraces. Branford, Ellington, Hartford, Manchester, and Penwood soils are on nearby outwash terraces and are underlain by stratified sand and gravel. Broadbrook soils are well drained and are yellower. Holyoke soils have bedrock within a 10 to 20 inch depth. Cheshire and Narragansett soils are well drained and do not have a dense substratum. Rainbow soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the B horizon. Wapping soils do not have a dense substratum. Yalesville soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

Ludlow soils were previously classified as Aquic Dystrochrepts and before that as Typic Fragiochrepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 26 inches (Bw horizon).\n3. Aquic feature - iron depletions are within a 24 inch depth (Bw2 horizon).\n4. Dense till substratum - the zone from 26 to 65 inches (Cd horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
