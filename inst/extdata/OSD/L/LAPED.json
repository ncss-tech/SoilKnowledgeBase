  "OVERVIEW": "The Laped series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolitic tuffs, basalt and andesite.  Laped soils are on plateaus, table lands, calderas, mountains, foothill and hill summits, crests, shoulders, side slopes and summits.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
