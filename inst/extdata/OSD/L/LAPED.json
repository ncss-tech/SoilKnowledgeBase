  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in alluvium, residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff, andesite and basalt. Elevations are 1,160 to 1,955 meters.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 to 230 mm; mean annual temperature is about 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Old Camp soils lack a duripan and have an aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.  Osoll soils are loamy-skeletal and lack an argillic horizon.  Puett soils lack diagnostic horizons and are shallow to a paralithic contact."
