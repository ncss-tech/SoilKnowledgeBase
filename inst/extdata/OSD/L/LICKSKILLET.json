  "OVERVIEW": "The Lickskillet series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in stony colluvium consisting of loess, rock fragments and residuum weathered from basalt and rhyolite. Lickskillet soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 120 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F; dry for minimum of 90 consecutive days. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock is 12 to 20 inches. Some pedons have free carbonates in coatings on the lower sides of rock fragments and extending into cracks in the underlying rock. The solum has 10YR or 7.5YR hue.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, and silt loam. Rock fragment content is 5 to 70 percent and are dominantly stones and cobbles. Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent. Combined thickness of the A and BA horizons, or AB horizon when present, is 7 to 15 inches. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist and chroma is 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and averages more than 18 percent clay and 35 to 85 percent rock fragments dominantly cobbles and gravel. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon or a thin Btk or Bt horizon with clay films on some rock fragments, in pores and extending into fractures in the bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lickskillet soils are typically on south-facing canyon and mountain side slopes at elevations of 200 to 4,500 feet. In eastern and northcentral Washington, it is on benches, shoulders of plateaus, canyon side slopes, hills, and ridgetops. Slope gradients are commonly 40 to 70 percent and range from about 0 to 120 percent. The soils formed in shallow stony colluvium mixed with loess and rock fragments weathered from the underlying basalt or rhyolite. Some pedons in north-central Washington, have minor amounts of glacial till mixed into the soil profile. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 9 to 14 inches but ranges up to 20 inches on south slopes in MLRA 43c. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, mean winter temperature is 31 to 35 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 200 days."

Gem soils are fine family and on uplands.  Morrow soils are fine-silty and on plateaus.  Redcliff soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on hills.  Ruckles soils are clayey-skeletal and are on hills and canyon slopes.  Starbuck soils are loamy and are on hillslopes and benches.  Walla Walla soils are coarse-silty and are on hills.  Wrentham soils are moderately deep and are on north-facing canyon slopes."
