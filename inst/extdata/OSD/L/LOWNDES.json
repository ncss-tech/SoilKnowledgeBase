  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Hard white nodules range from none to few in the A, EB, Bt and B/E horizons and from few to common in the B't horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in all horizons except where limed.  Average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  The EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Some pedons may have an E' horizon in colors and textures the same as the E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nIn the B/E horizon, the B part has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam. The E part occurs as common to many medium to coarse pockets with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and chroma of 3 through 6 and texture is sand or loamy sand.  The E' horizon, where present, has the same color range as the Bt horizon.  In addition, it includes hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 8.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  There are none to common mottles in shades of red, brown and gray.  In some pedons there is a BC horizon with colors the same as the B't horizon.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Autryville, Bonneau, Boykin, Briley, Letney, Lovett, Rosalie, and Trep series of the same family and the Albany, Blanton, Darco, Lucy, Ocilla, Pocalla, Troup, Wadley, and Wagram series of closely related families.  All series listed except Pocalla lack a bisequal profile and all lack hard white rounded nodules.  In addition, Albany, Blanton, Darco, Troup, and Wadley soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick, and Troup soils have a kandic horizon.  Bonneau soils have a seasonal high water table and mottles with chroma 2 or less at depths of about 40 inches.  Lovett soils are moderately well drained. Lucy, Troup, and Wagram soils have a kandic horizon. In addition Lucy soils have yellowish red or red Bt horizons, and Wagram soils lack mottles of chroma 2 or less within 60 inches of the surface.  Pocalla soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the surface. Ocilla soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper Bt horizon. Rosalie soils have yellowish red or red Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lowndes soils are on moderately sloping to steep sideslopes on uplands in the Southern Coastal Plain.  They are restricted to that part of the Hawthorn geological formation that has been influenced by the Ocala limestone uplift.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 17 percent.  Elevation is 90 to 200 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 62 to 71 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 24 inches.  (Ap and E horizons.)\nArenic epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 30 inches.  (AP, E and EB horizons.)\nArgillic horizon - the zones from approximately 30 to 40 inches and 48 to 76 inches.  (Bt, B't1, B't2, and B't3 horizons.)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The thesis Characterization and Classification of Some Phosphatic Soils of Georgia is summarized by the author, Raymond Little, with these statements and conclusions:  (1) Study was conducted of some soils of Georgia believed to be phosphatic in origin.  (2) Six of nine pedons studied contained at least 0.1% total p.  (3) Phosphorus usually increased with depth indicating possible influence of phosphatic parent material.\nRevised 1/93\nSIR=GA0039\nMLRA=133A\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
