  "OVERVIEW": "The Lowndes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on Coastal Plain uplands.  These soils are bisequal.  They have thick brownish loamy sand A and E horizons over strong brown sandy clay loam Bt horizons that are underlain by a lower sequence of a strong brown loamy sand B/E horizon and strong brown sandy clay loam and sandy clay B't horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 17 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. and precipitation is about 49 inches.",

Hard white nodules range from none to few in the A, EB, Bt and B/E horizons and from few to common in the B't horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in all horizons except where limed.  Average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  The EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Some pedons may have an E' horizon in colors and textures the same as the E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nIn the B/E horizon, the B part has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam. The E part occurs as common to many medium to coarse pockets with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and chroma of 3 through 6 and texture is sand or loamy sand.  The E' horizon, where present, has the same color range as the Bt horizon.  In addition, it includes hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 8.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay.

All series listed except Pocalla lack a bisequal profile and all lack hard white rounded nodules.  In addition, Albany, Blanton, Darco, Troup, and Wadley soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick, and Troup soils have a kandic horizon.  Bonneau soils have a seasonal high water table and mottles with chroma 2 or less at depths of about 40 inches.  Lovett soils are moderately well drained. Lucy, Troup, and Wagram soils have a kandic horizon. In addition Lucy soils have yellowish red or red Bt horizons, and Wagram soils lack mottles of chroma 2 or less within 60 inches of the surface.  Pocalla soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the surface. Ocilla soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper Bt horizon. Rosalie soils have yellowish red or red Bt horizons."
