Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2100 to 2600 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
