  "OVERVIEW": "The Larioscamp series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and welded rhyolitic tuff.  Larioscamp soils are on calderas and foothills and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
