Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and loess from basalt, welded rhyolitic tuff and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 280 to 330 cm and average annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
