    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to C horizons\ncontaining limestone gravel, cobbles, and stones ranges from 20 to\n40 inches.  Depth to calcareous soil material ranges from 18 to 27 inches.  Volume of fragments of ironstone, in the solum, ranges\nfrom few to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4), or reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4).  A horizons with moist values and chromas of less than 3.5 are less than 7 inches thick.  The A horizon is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges\nfrom slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe B2t horizons are brown (7.5YR 5/4), yellowish red (5YR 5/6), reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4), light reddish brown (5YR 6/4), or\nred (2.5YR 5/6).  Texture is clay loam or clay with a range of 35\nto 50 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B3ca horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or reddish brown (5YR 5/4).  Contrasting mottles of strong brown or reddish brown range from\nnone to common. Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay, or silty\nclay loam.  Concretions, soft masses of calcium carbonate, and fragments of limestone range from few to 50 percent by volume.\nThe Cca horizons are yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), strong brown\n(7.5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3), light brown (7.5YR 6/4),\nor reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6).  The fine earth fraction of the\nC1ca horizon is silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe volume of fragments of limestone ranges from 45 to 80 percent.  It contains 35 to 50 percent fragments of gravel, 10 to 20 percent fragments of cobble, and up to 10 percent fragments of flat\nlimestone 3 to 5 feet long, 2 to 3 feet wide, and 1 to 6 inches thick.  Cobble and stone content is variable within short\ndistances.  Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to 35 percent by volume.  The fine earth fraction of the C2ca horizon is silty clay or clay.  It contains 10 to 30 percent limestone gravel and cobbles and 15 to 40 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bexar, Callahan, Fulshear, Hillco, Lindy, Mingo, and Thurber series.  Bexar soils have 15 to\n35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Callahan\nsoils have a paralithic contact with shale at 24 to 40 inches\ndepth.  In addition, Callahan soils are dry in the moisture\ncontrol section for longer periods.  Fulshear soils have thicker\nsola and lack carbonates within 28 inches of the surface.  Hillco\nand Mingo soils have a mollic epipedon.  Lindy soils lack\nsecondary carbonates within 28 inches of the soil surface and have\na lithic contact to limestone.  Thurber soils have\nmontmorillonitic mineralogy."
