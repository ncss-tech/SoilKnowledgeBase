  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry but moist in some part of the surface 12 inches for a continuous period equal to more than 1/4 of the time that the soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to about 53 degrees F.  The soil is calcareous and ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.  No strongly contrasting textures are within 40 inches of the surface and no bedrock is within 60 inches.  The 10 to 40 section ranges in texture from silt loam to silty clay loam with a weighted average of 20 to 32 percent clay and with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The brittle horizon is less than 6 inches thick, weakly to moderately cemented and occurs at depths ranging from 16 to 36 inches.  Loose gravel, sand or volcanic ash may occur at depths below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR, chromas of 2 or 3, and values of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.\nThe AC and C horizons have color values of 3 to 4 moist and 5 to 7 dry with chromas of 2 to 3 moist and dry.  The upper horizons are moderately affected by excess salt and sodium."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Stanfield soils have a duripan and have less than 18 percent clay in their control sections.  Umapine soils have less than 18 percent clay in their control sections and have sodium saturation that is 15 percent or more in the upper 20 inches and decreases below.  Sagemoor, Shano, and Warden soils lack the brittle horizon and are neutral or mildly alkaline in the surface soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Luce soils occur on gently sloping low alluvial fans.  The regolith consists of stratified medium and moderately fine textured alluvium from mixed materials.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 10 to 14 inches.  The average July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 32 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.  The yearly fluctuation is large with 30 days being common."
