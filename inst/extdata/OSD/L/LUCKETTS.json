They formed in colluvium derived from quartzite and greenstone overlying residuum derived from calcareous conglomerate, in the Triassic Basin of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."
