  "OVERVIEW": "The Lesliecreek series consists of very deep, stratified, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Lesliecreek soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
