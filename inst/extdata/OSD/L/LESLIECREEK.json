Sprone soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments derived mainly from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age and Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age and are on the Southern High Plains (MLRA 77) and are more moist in May and June. Toyah soils are drier with mean annual precipitation of 10 to 16 inches and have hues redder than 7.5YR."
