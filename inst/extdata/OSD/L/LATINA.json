  "OVERVIEW": "The Latina series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable, saline and sodic soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are low coastal plains depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about degrees 22.8 C (73 degrees F)",
