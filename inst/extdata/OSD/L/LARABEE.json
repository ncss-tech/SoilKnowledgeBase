  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Larabee soils are on hill backslopes and shoulders, and canyons of dissected basalt plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. These soils formed largely in material weathered from basalt or welded tuff, with minor additions of loess and volcanic ash. Elevations are typically 3,400 to 5,600 feet but range to 2,800 feet on north and east-facing slopes in Oregon. Average annual precipitation is typically 24 to 30 inches, but ranges to 17 inches in northeastern Oregon. The average annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
