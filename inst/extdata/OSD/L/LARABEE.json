  "OVERVIEW": "The Larabee series consists of well drained, moderately deep soils on hills and canyons. They formed in colluvium weathered from basalt or welded tuff with an influence of loess and volcanic ash. Permeability is moderately slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 90 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

These soils formed largely in material weathered from basalt or welded tuff, with minor additions of loess and volcanic ash. Elevations are typically 3,400 to 5,600 feet but range to 2,800 feet on north and east-facing slopes in Oregon. Average annual precipitation is typically 24 to 30 inches, but ranges to 17 inches in northeastern Oregon. The average annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
