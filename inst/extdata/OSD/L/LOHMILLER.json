The control section averages from 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have value of 4 dry and 3 moist in the upper 4 inches.  It typically is silty clay loam or clay loam but is silty clay in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is clay loam or silty clay loam but is silty clay or clay in some pedons.  It is stratified with thin layers of loamy sand, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have accumulations of carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lohmiller soils are on flood plains and high bottom lands of rivers and streams and on alluvial fans of foot slopes. Slopes are typically less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in calcareous alluvium from sedimentary rock.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 19 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arvada, Haverson, Kyle, Norka, Pierre, Savo, and Stetter soils. Arvada soils have a natric horizon and are on similar landscapes.  Haverson soils have a fine-loamy control section and are on similar landscapes.  Kyle, Norka, Pierre, and Savo soils are on steeper and higher landscapes.  Kyle and Pierre soils are very-fine textured and do not have stratification. Norka and Savo soils have argillic horizons. Stetter soils contain more clay and crack when dry and are on similar landscapes."
