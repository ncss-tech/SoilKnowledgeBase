  "OVERVIEW": "The Lintim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from shale.  Lintim soils are on mountains, hills, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
