  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lilygap soils are typically on lower portions of mountainflanks of lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. Elevation is 900 to 1425 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C. The frost free season is 185 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devilsnose, Iron Mountain, Mantree, McCarthy and Redapple soils. Iron Mountain soils are shallow and occur on mountaintops and steep mountainflanks. Devilsnose and McCarthy (moderately deep) soils are medial over loamy and medial-skeletal, respectively, and occur on the middle to upper thirds of mountainflanks. Mantree soils are fine-loamy, occur on mountaintops and mountainflanks below lahars and formed in residuum from intrusive igneous rock. Redapple soils are fine and occur on stable summits and backslopes of lahars."
