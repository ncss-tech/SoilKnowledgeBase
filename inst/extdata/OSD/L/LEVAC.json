These mounds were leveled and an Ap horizon formed during leveling operations. The type location was moved during the update of MLRA 150A to a location with laboratory data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 48 to 98 cm (19 to 39 in. (Btk and Btkss1 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19in). (Ap1, Ap2, and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80in). (Bt, Btkss1, Btkss2, Btkss3, Btkssg horizons)\nVertic features: The presence of cracks from 0 to 72 cm (0 to 28 in) and slickensides from 72 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in). (Btkss1, Btkss2, Btkss3, Btkssg horizons)\nAdditional Comments: The type location was described when soil conditions were slightly moist and dry consistence could not be observed. When dry, the consistence for these soils are very hard in the surface layer.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data exists from pedon S10TX0714802 at the type location\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
