  "OVERVIEW": "The Lytell series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from siltstone or very fine grained sandstone. Lytell soils are on hillsides and ridgetops and have slopes of 5 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is 10 to 35 percent siltstone parafragments.  It has 7 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe BA, Bw, and BC horizons have value of 3 to 5 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 8 moist and dry. Texture is medial clay loam or medial silty clay loam. Siltstone parafragments range from 15 to 85 percent."
