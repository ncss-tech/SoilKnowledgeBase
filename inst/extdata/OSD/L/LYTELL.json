    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick. Depth to moderately cemented bedrock is 40 to more than 70 inches. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 2.5 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 95 percent, 15 bar water retention of 15 to 20 percent for air dried samples, 27 to 35 percent apparent clay by field estimate and averages 35 to 60 percent siltstone parafragments. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is 10 to 35 percent siltstone parafragments.  It has 7 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe BA, Bw, and BC horizons have value of 3 to 5 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 8 moist and dry. Texture is medial clay loam or medial silty clay loam. Siltstone parafragments range from 15 to 85 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lytell soils are on colluvial hillsides and ridgetops deeply incised by drainages arranged in a weak dendritic pattern. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. Elevation ranges from sea level to 1,700 feet. These soils formed in material weathered from siltstone or very fine grained sandstone. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and relatively cool summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 125 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."

Organic carbon estimates are based on data taken on the Astoria series and are available at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska: Sample Number S77WA25-3. A benchmark soil study by Washington State University is also available. The WSU study has bulk density data and supports the change in classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
