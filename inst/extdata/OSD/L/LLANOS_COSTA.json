  "OVERVIEW": "The Llanos Costa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mountain foot slopes and alluvial fans of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in gravelly sediments that weathered from basalt, chert and rhyolite.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",
