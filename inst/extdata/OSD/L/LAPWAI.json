Coxlake, Endersby, Narcisse, Patit Creek, Plinco, and Tombeall soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Endersby, Narcisse, Plinco, and Tombeall soils have redoximorphic concentrations above 60 inches.  Evans and Leavenworth soils do not have very gravelly textures in the lower part of the series  control section.  Okanogan, Poween, and Threecreeks soils do not have a  Bk horizon above 40 inches.  Pleasant View soils have a Bk horizon with  12 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Redola soils are calcareous throughout."

These soils formed in loamy alluvium from mixed sources over gravelly alluvium predominantly from basalt.  Elevations are 750 to 1,200 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches,  average annual temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F., and the frost free period is 160 to 185 days."
