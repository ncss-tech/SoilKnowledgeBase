  "OVERVIEW": "The Lickinfork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Lickinfork soils are on mountain slopes and in canyons. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 985 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
