Arpatutu soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Asabean soils are weathered from sedimentary rocks, and are likely to have a mean annual soil temperature between 8 and 11 degrees C. Behemotosh soils formed in rhyolitic bedrock and are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Collayomi soils are formed in amorphous material from basic igneous rocks. Hewent soils are formed in metavolcanic rock and are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Hoosimbim soils formed in metavolcanic and metasedimentary rock and are deep to a lithic contact. Marpa soils formed in metasedimentary rock and are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Pendola soils are formed in basic metavolcanic rock and have 2.5YR colors in all parts of the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lickinfork soils are on mountain slopes and in canyons, mostly on mountainflank positions. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 330 to 1240 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 805 to 1220 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 12 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 185 to 285 days."
