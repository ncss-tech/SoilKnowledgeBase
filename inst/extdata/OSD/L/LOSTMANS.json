    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches) (Ak horizon)\n2. Lithic contact - 30 to 56 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) (2R horizon)\n3. Aquic conditions - 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)\n4. Endosaturation - 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches)\nThe mineralogy of this soil is mixed due to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  However, the sand mineralogy is siliceous.  The carbonates are due to recharge from a fluctuating ground water table. These carbonates do not qualify for a Calcic horizon.\nSoil classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nThis soil was formerly recognized as Ochopee soils in the hyperthermic temperature regime."
