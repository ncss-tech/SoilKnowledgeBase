    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches thick and may include the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.  The rock fragment content is less than 2 percent by volume throughout the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1.  A chroma of 2 is allowed in cultivated pedons.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nE horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam or clay loam with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and a clay content of 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Clean sand and silt coatings on ped faces are in the upper part.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 12 to 35 and is higher than the C horizon.\nSome pedons have 2BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loamy very fine sand.  Some pedons have thin strata of fine sand below depths of 40 inches.  Reaction is slighlty alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 12 to 35.\nA moderately wet phase is recognized on slopes of less than 5 percent."
