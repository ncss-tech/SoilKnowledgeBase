  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The lower boundary of the solum rests abruptly on limestone or grades into bedded limestone. The weighted average clay content in the control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  In some pedons there are rounded siliceous pebbles and cobbles concentrated 1 to 2 inches above the limestone.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the solum.  Pockets of soil between limestone fractures extend to depths of 80 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon, where present, is about 1 or 2 units of value more than the A horizon.  E horizon texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral. The combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 7 to 17 inches.\nThe Bt and/or Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Few to common mottles range in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline. Calcium carbonate concretions range from 0 to 15 percent. Black concretions range from none to common.\nThe 2R layer is hard limestone bedrock that is tightly fractured.  Fossils range from none to common.  Hardness is more than 3 on Moh`s  scale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Cisco, Gholson, May, and Personville soils in the same family.  Similar soils are Gasil, Groesbeck, Rosanky and Silawa series.  Cisco, Gholson, May and Gasil soils do not have a lithic contact. Groesbeck soils have a mollic epipedon and are moderately well drained.  Personville soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Silawa soils are underlain by stratified sandy and loamy sediments and sola is 40 to more than 72 inches.  Rosanky soils have a fine textured control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lavender soils are on gently sloping uplands.  These soils formed in loamy Pleistocene sediments deposited over the Tehuacana Limestone, mainly of the Midway group of Tertiary Age.  Slope gradients are mainly 1 to 3 percent but range to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 38 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 250 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 430 to 650 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 56 to 64."

The Axtell and Gredge soils have fine textured argillic horizons and are in similar positions. Groesbeck soils have a mollic epipedon.  Personville soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick.  Rader soils are in concave positions and have gray mottles due to wetness.  Silawa soils have sola more than 40 inches.  Styx soils have a solum of 60 to more than 80 inches."
