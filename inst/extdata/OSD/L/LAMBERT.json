  "OVERVIEW": "The Lambert soils consist of very deep, well drained soils formed recent alluvium on uplands, fans and terraces.  These soils are moderately slowly permeable.  They are on 0 to 65 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Lambert soils are usually moist but are dry in the upper part of the C horizons for cumulative period of three months after late June.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 18 to 35 percent clay and has less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section.  It contains a few lime nodules in its upper part of the profile in some pedons.  A few seams or nests of gypsum occur below 30 inches in some pedons.  Stratification below 30 inches ranges from very fine sandy loam to light silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lambert soils are on steep and very steep slopes of uplands and on level to sloping fans and terraces.  The soils formed in very deep, calcareous silt loam sediments that may be deeply weathered, weakly consolidated bedrock or are deposited by wind as loess, by water as alluvium, or are glaciolacustrine deposits or silty glacial drift.  The thickness of these deposits is usually more than five feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The climate is semiarid.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., mean annual January air temperature 20 to 25 degrees F. and mean July air temperature 65 to 70 degrees F."
