  "OVERVIEW": "The Longsfolly series consists of deep to soft fanglomerate, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from fanglomerate on hills. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",
