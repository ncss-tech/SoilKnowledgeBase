    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Longsfolly soils are on east and north facing hills. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from fanglomerate of the Temblor Formation. Elevation is 950 to 2,400 feet (290 to 735 meters). The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches (432 to 483 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F (15 to 17 degrees C).  The frost free season is 190 to 210 days."

The Ordeal soils are moderately deep to paralithic bedrock on mostly south-facing backslopes of hills under chamise.  The Passion soils are shallow to paralithic bedrock on shoulders of hills under chamise.  The Tuborcio soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and are on backslopes of hills under blue oak savannah."
