  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The range in characteristics includes 50 percent or more of the pedon.  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Amplitude of waviness and thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 40 inches.  In over half the pedon, the dominant chroma is less than 1.5 to depths of 40 inches or more.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth ranging from 5 to 24 inches.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai mirorelief with microknolls 2 to 8 inches higher than microlows.  Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microlow ranges from 12 to 24 feet.  When dry, these soils have cracks from 0.3 to 2.5 inches wide that extend from the surface, or from the base of the Ap horizon, into the Bky horizon.  Electrical conductivity (EC) of the saturation extract above a depth of 40 inches ranges from 0.5 to 4 dS/m and ranges from 4 to 8 dS/m to 80 inches.  Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) ranges from 1 to 6 in the upper 20 inches, 5 to 15 from 20 to 40 inches, and 10 to 20 at 40 to 80 inches.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses range from few to common and gypsum crystal range from few to common in the Bky horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout the pedon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma 1.  Texture of the Ap horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma 1.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bss and Bssk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma 1 or 2.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 6 to 8, and chroma 1 to 4.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buchel, Danjer, Monteola, and Rosenbrock series in the same family.  Similar soils include Benito, Lomalta, Mercedes, Montell, Tiocano, and Victoria series.  Buchel soils do not have accumulations of gypsum in the lower part of the solum. and are on floodplains.  Danjer soils have dominant chroma of more than 1.5 in the 10- to 40- inch control section.  Monteola soils have less than 14 inches of amplitude in the boundary between the A and B horizons and are formed from clay and shale of the Oakville Formation.  Rosenbrock soils are deep to siltstone.  Benito and Lomalta soils have more than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Lomalta soils, as well as Mercedes and Montell soils, have an ochric epipedon.  Tiocano and Victoria soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for cropland.  Crops are grain sorghum and cotton, with some corn grown.  A few gently sloping areas are in improved pastures of coastal bermudagrass.  Some areas are used for rangeland.  Principal native grasses are little bluestem, four-flower trichloris, vine-mesquite, plains bristlegrass, and Arizona cottontop.  Woody invaders are mainly mesquite, huisache, spiny hackberry, and whitebrush"
