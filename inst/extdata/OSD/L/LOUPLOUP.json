    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle and depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 14 to 30 inches. Depth to a densic contact is 40 to 60 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples and 0 to 10 percent gravel. The lower part of the particle-size control section has 5 to 10 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has a value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 1 to 3 moist. Mollic colors are only present in the upper 3 to 6 inches. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or ashy fine sandy loam, and has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2CB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam, and may be gravelly. It has 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw or 2BC horizon instead of a 2CB horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Some pedons have common, large, faint to distinct mottles. It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam. In some pedons, it ranges to very gravelly loamy sand below 40 inches. It has 15 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."
