  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lolak soils are on basin floors and lake plains.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, basalt, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,700 feet.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 15 inches, the mean annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bicondoa, Cuminvar, and Tandy soils.  Bicondoa soils have darker surface colors. Cuminvar soils have 8 to 16 inch thick organic surface.  Tandy soils have sandy over loamy control sections."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible or very high surface runoff depending on ponding; very slow permeability (low or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 2 feet (very shallow to moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between March and July.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  The saturation fluctuates with the level of water in adjacent lakes or playas.  It is highest during spring runoff and drops to about 6 feet in the fall.  Some phases are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods year-round.  Some phases are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from March through May with water up to one foot deep."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Lolak soils are used to provide livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is sparse in the high-lying areas and is mainly black greasewood, suaeda, and some inland saltgrass.  It is fairly dense in the lower-lying areas and consists of inland saltgrass and rush."
