    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 120 to 150 days (cumulative) after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock of the Deschutes Formation is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and may include the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry .  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and contains 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 40 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay and contains 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR but may range to 5YR.  It has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Crkq horizon is paralithic tuff or water laid sediments of the Deschutes Formation.  It is strongly to violently effervescent."

Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1400 to 2400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and moist winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
