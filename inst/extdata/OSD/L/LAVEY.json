  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on upland terraces.  They formed in loess and colluvium over sedimentary rock or tuff of the Deschutes Formation.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock of the Deschutes Formation is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and may include the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry .  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and contains 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 40 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay and contains 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR but may range to 5YR.  It has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Crkq horizon is paralithic tuff or water laid sediments of the Deschutes Formation.  It is strongly to violently effervescent."
