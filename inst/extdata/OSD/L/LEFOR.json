Beartooth, Bullflat, Cortyzack, Dooley, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Felor, Greenway, Hangdo, Livona, Martinsdale, Sponseller, Trag, Ulrant, Vida, Wemple, Williams and Yegen series do not have soft sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Beeno series have 27 to 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Bookcliff series have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Gurney, Maudlin, Moen and Watrous soils have lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Lininger soils do not have carbonates in the solum.  Reeder soils typically have less than 45 percent fine sand and coarser, and contain more clay."

Morton, Reeder and Vebar soils are on nearby uplands.  Morton soils are fine-silty.  Vebar soils do not have argillic horizons and are coarse-loamy.  Cabba, Cohagen and Flasher soils are on nearby steep hills and have soft bedrock within depths of 20 inches.  Parshall and Tally soils are in nearby swales or on terraces and do not have argillic horizons.  In addition, they are coarse-loamy, and Parshall soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick."
