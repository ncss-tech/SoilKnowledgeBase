Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent, but can range up to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, and occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June to September. The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  The elevation is 1,710 to 3,995 feet."
