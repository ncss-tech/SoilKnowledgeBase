  "OVERVIEW": "The Lomapelona series consists of very deep and moderately well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Lomapelona soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans, and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm (11 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
