  "OVERVIEW": "The Ligurta series consists of very deep, well drained, strongly saline soils that formed in fan alluvium weathered from a wide variety of rocks.  Ligurta soils are on fan terraces with slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
