  "OVERVIEW": "The Leeds series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone, limestone and shale.  The Leeds soils are on alluvial valleys and fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

The silty clay loam results from the application of irrigation water that is high in silt content.
