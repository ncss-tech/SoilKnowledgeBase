The silty clay loam results from the application of irrigation water that is high in silt content. The silted material ranges from 4 to 19 inches thick, but most commonly is 8 to 14 inches thick\nC horizon\nHue: 5YR or 2.5YR\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist\nChroma: 4 through 6\nTexture: sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam, and in some pedons is stratified with very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam\nRock fragments: Some pedons contain 5 to 20 percent gravel"

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, limestone, and shale. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 F. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. The frost free period ranges from 190 to 200 days."
