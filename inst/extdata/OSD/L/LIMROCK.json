  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but commonly is less than 30 inches. Rock fragments, primarily limestone boulders and stones with lesser amounts of channers and flagstones, range from 15 to 60 percent by volume in each horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nSome pedons may have a thin E horizon with hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Mottles in shades of brown range from none to common. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons can have hue of 5YR in small pockets. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray range from none to common. Gray mottles are relicts of weathered parent material. Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay or silty clay.\nThe BC or C horizon, where present, have hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to\n6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons are mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray without a dominant color. Gray mottles are relicts of weathered parent material. Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay or silty clay."

Gladeville and Barfield soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  The Ashwood, Carbo, Colbert, Gladdice, Lyerly,\nand Talbott series have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control\nsection.  Colbert and Lyerly soils have a water table or wetness features in the subsoil during parts of the year. Carbo soils are in the mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Limrock soils are on rolling to very steep hillsides in association with numerous outcrops of limestone bedrock.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent, but are commonly steeper than 20 percent. They formed in fine textured residuum of limestone and, in some areas, a thin layer of soil creep. Sinkholes are common. Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is 59.5 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 58.7 inches."
