  "OVERVIEW": "The Leavitt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from crystalline and sedimentary rock.  Leavitt soils are on relict fan aprons, coalescing fans, terraces, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
