  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to more than 20 inches in thickness.  Many pedons contain carbonates to the surface, but some do not have carbonates to depths of 30 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Typically, the series control section averages between 45 to 60 percent clay, 30 to 55 percent silt and less than 10 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It typically is silty clay, but it is clay or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.   It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It contains gypsum in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nSome pedons have a By horizon up to 15 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  It is stratified or laminated in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have thin strata of coarser textures below a depth of 40 inches.  Some pedons have gypsum in the C horizon."

Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 4 percent, but some are as steep as 9 percent.   The soil formed in calcareous clayey sediments.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 19 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."
