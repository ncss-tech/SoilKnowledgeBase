  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawther series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey sediments.  These soils are on uplands, fans and terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

Many pedons contain carbonates to the surface, but some do not have carbonates to depths of 30 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Typically, the series control section averages between 45 to 60 percent clay, 30 to 55 percent silt and less than 10 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It typically is silty clay, but it is clay or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.   It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It contains gypsum in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nSome pedons have a By horizon up to 15 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.
