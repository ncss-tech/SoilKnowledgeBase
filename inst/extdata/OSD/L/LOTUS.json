  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to layers with textures finer than loamy fine sand ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The clay content ranges from 2 to 15 percent and the silt plus clay ranges from 10 to 25 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Reaction of the A horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid and the C, Ab and Cb horizons are very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.  The Ab horizon has the same color and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe C and Cb horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Mottles where present are in shades of brown or gray.  Texture is sand, fine sandy, loamy sand or loamy fine sand."

The Chipley and Pactolus soils do not have buried A horizons within the solum.  All of the remaining competing series also lack buried A horizons within the solum.  In addition, the Alaga, Alpin, Arenosa, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Darden, Foxworth, Fripp, Glentosh, Kershaw, Lakeland, Newhan, Ortega, and Tonkawa soils do not have a water table within 3 feet of the soil surface.  Also the Corolla, Fripp, Kershaw, Newhan, Ortega, and Ousley series have less than 5 percent slit plus clay in the control section."

The climate is warm and humid with a mean annual temperature of 65.5 degrees F., and an average rainfall of 54 inches near the type location."

The Beauregard, Betis, Briley, Ruston, and Smithdale soils occur on higher upland landscapes, have argillic horizons, redder hues and finer textures than Lotus soils.  Guyton soils occur on floodplains at slightly lower elevations, are poorly drained, and have fine-silty control sections."
