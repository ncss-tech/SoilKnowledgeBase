  "REVDATE": "04/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamoose series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in outwash and alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, outwash fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
