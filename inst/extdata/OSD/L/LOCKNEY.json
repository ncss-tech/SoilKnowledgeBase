The soil moisture control section cracks and is dry in some or all parts of the upper 50 cm more than 150 but less than 210 cumulative days in normal years.  July through August and November through March are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June.  The soil receives runoff from the surrounding uplands and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods than normal for the climate.\nMean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 F).\nThickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 50 cm (9 to 20 inches).\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate: 50 to 150 cm (20 to 60 inches).\nDepth to calcic horizon: 150 to more than 203 cm (60 to 80 inches).\nDepth to slickensides: 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 inches).\nLinear extensibility of top 1 meter (40 inches): 7 to 10 cm (2.75 to 4 inches).\nSolum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 inches).\nParticle-size control section (weighted average): 40 to 60 percent silicate clay.\nThis is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 inches) higher than microlows.  Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1.5 to 6 meters (5 to 20 feet). The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate area between the high and low about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent.  Cracks open and close each year, except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years.  When dry, 1.3 to 7.6 cm (0.5 to 3 inch) wide cracks, extend from the surface to a depth of 100 cm (40 inches) or more.  Cracks are more prominent in the microlow.
