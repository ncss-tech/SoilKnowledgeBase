  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lowemar soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on linear/slightly concave, steeply sloping upper mountain backslopes below rock outcrop on all aspects of upper elevations and northern aspects at lower elevations.  These soils formed in loess over colluvium derived from metamorphic parent material.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,680 to 3,050 meters.  The climate is cold. Snow load in the area is thinned due to high velocity winds but persists until June. Summer moisture derives from regular summer thunderstorms in July and August. The mean annual precipitation is 600 cm to 710 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C. Frost may occur at the higher elevations during any of the summer months."

Inpendence soils are frigid with a consistent O horizon development. Tusel soils average greater than 25 percent clay in the particle size control section. Shively soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Tusel, Shively and Hapgood soils have a lithic contact at 100 cm or more and a reaction of neutral to slightly acidic with a base saturation greater than 50 percent."
