  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of soft sandstone is 42 to 52 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 61 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 10 and 18 inches is usually moist in some part from about December 1 until late in May and is continuously dry the rest of the year.  The A horizon is pale brown, light brownish gray or grayish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/2, 5/2).  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  In some pedons the upper 2 or 3 inches have granular structure.  Some pedons are massive throughout the A horizon and are hard when dry.  It is slightly or medium acid.  The B2t horizon is light brownish gray, grayish brown or dark gray (10YR 6/2, 5/2, 4/1).  It is sandy clay or clay.  The upper boundary is abrupt and the clay increase from the A horizon to the B2t horizon is about 18 to 24 percent.  Some pedons have a distinct light gray or gray A2 horizon about 1/4 inch thick.  The upper part of the B2t horizon has medium to strong prismatic or columnar structure.  The lower part has weak or moderate prismatic or moderate or strong columnar structure.  Exchangeable sodium is 5 to 15 percent in the upper 16 inches of the B2t horizon and is 15 to 30 percent in some part below the upper boundary.  It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  A few fine soft lime bodies are present in some pedons in the lower part of the B2t horizon.  The C horizon is light gray, pale yellow or white."

Antioch, Placentia, San Miguel, Solano, Stockpen, and Waukena soils have natric horizons.  Bonsall soils have argillic horizons with chroma of 3 or more.  Milpitas and Tierra soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout the argillic horizons.  Sesame soils have argillic horizons with 18 to 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Las Flores soils are gently to strongly sloping and are on marine terraces at elevations of less than 700 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 13 inches.  Average January temperature is 53 degrees F., average July temperature is 71 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
