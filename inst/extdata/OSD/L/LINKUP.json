These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, conglomerate, shale, sandstone, welded tuffs and quartzite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,825 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual air temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
