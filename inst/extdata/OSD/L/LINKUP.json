  "OVERVIEW": "The Linkup series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, welded tuffs, conglomerate shale, sandstone and quartzite.  Linkup soils are on summits or crests and side slopes of plateaus, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
