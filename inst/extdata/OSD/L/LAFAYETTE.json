  "OVERVIEW": "The Lafayette series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Lafayette soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
