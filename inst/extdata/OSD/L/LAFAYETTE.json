  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lafayette soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep or very deep to calcareous stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9.4 to 11.1 degrees C (49 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Waupecan soils and the poorly drained Drummer and Mahalasville soils. Waupecan soils do not have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the subsoil and are on higher lying positions on stream terraces and outwash plains. Drummer and Mahalasville soils are on lower lying landform positions and have grayer subsoils. Where mapped in association with Lafayette soils, they have gravelly substrata."

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm ( 0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the winter and spring months in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum, and very rapid in the underlying material."
