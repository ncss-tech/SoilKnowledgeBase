  "OVERVIEW": "The Livco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These nearly level soils occur on flats on low coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1042 mm (41 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71.6 degrees F).",
