  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Soil salinity in the A or Ap horizon is less than 2 mmhos/cm.  In the the upper part of the Bt horizon the salinity range is from 2 to 8 mmhos/cm and the lower part ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos/cm.  SAR ranges from 2 to 6 in the A or Ap horizon, 13 to 30 in the upper 16 inches of the Bt horizon and from 13 to 40 to a depth of 80 inches in the Bt and BC horizons.  Depth to layers containing secondary carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  Iron-manganese concretions 1 to 7 mm in diameter range from none to few throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is hard or very hard when dry.  Some pedons have few brownish or yellowish mottles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn and Btkn horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6 and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is clay loam or clay with clay content of 35 to 45 percent in the Btn and 30 to 45 percent in the Btkn.  Most pedons have few to many mottles in shades of brown or yellow.  Calcium carbonate in the form of concretions, masses and threads range from none to about 5 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons the upper part of the Btn horizon is neutral.\nThe BCn or BCkn horizon has color in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  Mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown or gray range from none to common.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam or clay.  Calcium carbonate concretions or masses range from none to few.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon below 60 inches that have color in shades of red, brown or gray.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Livia, Matagorda, Narta and Palacios series.  Livia, Matagorda, Narta and Palacios soils have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Narta soils have greater salinity in the upper Bt horizon.  Matagorda soils have mixed mineralogy.  Palacios soils have moist color values of 3 or less in the upper 7 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Livco soils are on broad nearly level mounded coastal uplands of the middle Gulf Coast.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium on meanderbelt ridges of the Pleistocene Age Beaumont Formation.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F. Frost free days range from 270 to 305.  Elevations range from 20 to 70 feet.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 52 to 60."

Dacosta soils are slightly lower in the landscape and are mapped in a complex with these soils.  Laewest and Edna soils are on similar or slightly lower positions.  Telferner and Texana soils are on slightly higher positions.  Dacosta, Edna, Laewest, Telferner and Texana soils do not have natric horizons.  Laewest soils are clayey throughout.  Texana soils have a mollic epipedon."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland and rangeland.  Most cropland is in a rice-unimproved pasture rotation.  A few areas are used for corn and grain sorghum.  Native grasses are salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass, marshhay cordgrass, little bluestem and Indiangrass.  Woody invaders are mesquite, bushy sea-oxeye and cactus."
