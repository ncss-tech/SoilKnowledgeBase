  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness, and depth to loamy substrata, ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  When dry, the soil has cracks 0.5 to 4 inches wide that extend to a depth of 30 inches or more.  Slickensides begin at a depth of 15 to 30 inches below the surface.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is clay with clay content ranging from 60 to 75 percent.  Soil salinity ranges from moderately to strongly affected.  Electrical conductivity (EC) ranges from 12 to 50 dS/m throughout the pedon.  Exchangeable sodium (ESP) exceeds 15 percent in all horizons.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline throughout the pedon.\nThe A and B horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value 5 or 6, and chroma 0 or 1.  Moist values are more than 3.5.  The B horizons have redox features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma 2 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam."

Mercedes, Montell, Monteola, and Victoria soils have less than 60 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  In addition, Montell, Monteola, and Victoria soils have cracks that remain open more than 150 days most years, and Monteola and Victoria soils have a mollic epipedon."

The soil formed in clayey deltaic sediments.  Slope is less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 72 degrees to 74 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 330 to 350.  Elevation ranges from 1 to 10 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 32 to 38."

Harlingen soils have a epipedon with moist chroma of more than 1.5.  Latina and Sejita soils have less than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Point Isabel soils are Inceptisols.  Benito, Harlingen, and Mercedes soils occur at slightly higher elevations.  Latina and Sejita soils occur on similar surfaces. Point Isabel soils occur on clay dunes."
