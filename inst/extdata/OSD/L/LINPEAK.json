A revision in April 2003 updated the typical pedon and adjusted horizon depths for the Oi horizon as the soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S91NV-033-001 (pedon # 92P0143). Selected data are available for the Bw1, Bw2, and Bk horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
