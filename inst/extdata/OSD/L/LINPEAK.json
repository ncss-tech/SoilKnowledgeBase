These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shale. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,440 to 3,430 meters. The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, the mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."

A revision in April 2003 updated the typical pedon and adjusted horizon depths for the Oi horizon as the soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S91NV-033-001 (pedon # 92P0143). Selected data are available for the Bw1, Bw2, and Bk horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
