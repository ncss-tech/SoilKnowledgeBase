The wetter, poorly drained and fine textured Carbika and loamy textured Warnut soils are in nearby depressions. The wetter, somewhat poorly drained, loamy textured Carway soils are in nearby depressions. Dillhut soils are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, and have a loamy buried soil between 20 and 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters). Solvay soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Dillhut and Solvay soils are in interdunes. Pratt and Turon soils have a sandy argillic horizon which has both more and thicker lamellae. They are on lower sideslopes and undulating areas. Tivin soils do not have lamellae above 80 inches (203 centimeters) and are on similar positions."
