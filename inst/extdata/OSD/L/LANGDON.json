  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Langdon series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments. These soils are on undulating to rolling dunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes are complex and range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters) and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",

The wetter, poorly drained and fine textured Carbika and loamy textured Warnut soils are in nearby depressions. The wetter, somewhat poorly drained, loamy textured Carway soils are in nearby depressions. Dillhut soils are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, and have a loamy buried soil between 20 and 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters). Solvay soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Dillhut and Solvay soils are in interdunes. Pratt and Turon soils have a sandy argillic horizon which has both more and thicker lamellae. They are on lower sideslopes and undulating areas. Tivin soils do not have lamellae above 80 inches (203 centimeters) and are on similar positions."
