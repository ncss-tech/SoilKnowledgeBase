  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture of the soil to a depth of 40 inches is silty clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam with clay content of 18 to 35 percent; and sand coarser than very fine sand comprises more than 15 percent.  Stratification consists of 1/2 to 3 inch layers of clay through fine sandy loam.\nThe A and C horizons to a depth of 60 inches have value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Thin layers at depths below 20 inches in some pedons are darker than the surface layer.  Below 40 inches the texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Some pedons contain as much as 15 percent gravel and have dark staining below 50 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series.  Similar soils include Camargo, Clairemont, Colorado, Pulaski, Rio Grande, Yahola, and Zavala series.  All these soils except Camargo, Rio Grande, and Zavala have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F. Camargo and Clairemont soils have fine silty control sections. Pulaski, Yahola, and Zavala soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Rio Grande soils have coarse-silty control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Loire soils are on nearly level flood plains of rivers in the Rio Grande Plain that have upper drainage areas in the Edwards Plateau.  These soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent, but are dominantly less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 36 inches and mean annual temperatures range from about 71 to 73 degrees F. Frost free days range from 260 to 310 days and elevation ranges from 200 to 700 feet; Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 31 to 44."

Aransas soils have mollic epipedons and more than 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Colibro and Saspamco soils do not have stratification and have cambic horizons, and in addition, Saspamco soils have coarse-loamy control sections."
