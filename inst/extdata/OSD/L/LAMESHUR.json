Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon, and slightly acid to neutral in the C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 15 to 35 percent, by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Content of pebbles, cobbles, and stones ranges from 35 to more than 80 percent, by volume."

Carib soils are on flood plains, are fine-loamy, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Cinnamon Bay and Glynn soils are on similar positions but have Mollic epipedons.  Redhook soils are on lower, vegetated beach areas and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Sandy Point and Sugar Beach soils are in lower saline marshes, ponds, and flats and are very poorly drained.  In addition, Sugar Beach soils are organic.  Solitude soils are on slightly lower positions, are fine-loamy, and somewhat poorly drained."
