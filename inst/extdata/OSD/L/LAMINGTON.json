  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches and the base of the fragipan is below 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The upper part of the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume, of gravels and cobbles and the lower part from 0 to 25 percent. Rock fragments in the substratum range from 0 to 90 percent.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have silt loam BA or EB horizons up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 with high chroma mottles.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btxg horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8 with high chroma mottles.  Texture is clay loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is stratified and ranges from silty clay loam or silt loam to sand and gravel."

Shelmadine is a poorly drained soil formed in glacial or periglacial material with angular or flat rock fragments.\nThe Andover, Cokesbury and Nolo are soils in closely related families. Andover and Cokesbury soils are 10YR or yellowier within the solum. Nolo soils have angular or flat rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamington soils are on nearly level stream terraces which are seldom flooded.  They formed in old sediments derived largely from red and gray Triassic shale and sandstone.  The climate is humid and temperate.  Average annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, and a growing season of 170 to 200 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Lamington soils are a member of a drainage sequence which includes the well drained Birdsboro and the moderately well drained Raritan soils.  Bowmansville and Rowland soils are on nearby flood plains.  Both of these soils lack fragipans and are frequently flooded."
