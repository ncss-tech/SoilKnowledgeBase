  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamington series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in old sediments derived primarily from red Triassic shale and sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high.  Mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches and the base of the fragipan is below 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The upper part of the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume, of gravels and cobbles and the lower part from 0 to 25 percent. Rock fragments in the substratum range from 0 to 90 percent.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have silt loam BA or EB horizons up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 with high chroma mottles.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btxg horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8 with high chroma mottles.  Texture is clay loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is stratified and ranges from silty clay loam or silt loam to sand and gravel."
