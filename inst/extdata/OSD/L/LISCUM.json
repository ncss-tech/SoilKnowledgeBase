  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Liscum soils are saturated below a depth of about 10 inches from the mineral soil surface in mid-summer. Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 8 to 16 inches. Sand and gravel are present at a depth of more than 40 inches. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.\nThe O horizon ranges from peat in the upper part to muck in the lower part. The reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has matrix hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or N; value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Mottles are secondary colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 where present. Texture is stratified silt loam, fine sand, or very fine sandy loam. Buried O or other horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe C has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or N; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Redoximorphic concentrations have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; Value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 5.  Total coarse fragments range from 0 to 59 percent rounded gravel. The reaction class is slightly acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Liscum soils are on alluvial plains in broad valleys with slopes of 2 percent or less. They formed in stratified silty and sandy alluvium in areas where the regional water table is near the surface. Sandy or gravelly alluvium is present at a depth of more than 40 inches. The climate is boreal continental, with short, warm summers and long, cold winters. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 18 inches, approximately one third of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 21 to 28 degrees F."

The strong gleying, weakly acid or nonacid reaction, and lack of permafrost in the Liscum soils result from groundwater discharge.\nType location has been moved from the Gerstle River Area to the Greater\nFairbanks Area.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
