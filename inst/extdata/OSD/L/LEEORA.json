  "OVERVIEW": "The Leeora series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on concave surfaces on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 670 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
