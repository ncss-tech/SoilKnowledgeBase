The moderately well drained Dryden soils, the somewhat poorly drained Locke soils, and the poorly drained Barry soils form a common drainage sequence with the Lapeer soils. The sandy Oakville and Spinks soils are on slightly higher parts of some moraines. Small areas of the sandy somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils and the poorly drained Gilford and Mussey soils are in drainageways in some of the moraines."

A large part of the steeper slopes, and a small part of the gentler slopes are in permanent pasture or in woodland. Native vegetation is forest of oaks, shagbark hickory, and sugar maple."
