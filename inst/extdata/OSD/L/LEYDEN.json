  "OVERVIEW": "The Leyden series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly slope alluvium or colluvium overlying interbedded shale and sandstone. Leyden soils are on side slopes and ridges, and dip slopes of homoclinal ridges and hogbacks.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
