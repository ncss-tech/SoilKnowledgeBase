  "OVERVIEW": "The Leyden series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly alluvial materials derived from mixed sources overlying shale.  Leyden soils are on side slopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
