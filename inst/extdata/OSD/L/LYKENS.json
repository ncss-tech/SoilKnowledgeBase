  "OVERVIEW": "The Lykens series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits, a thin layer of loamy water-sorted material, and the underlying loamy till on water modified till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
