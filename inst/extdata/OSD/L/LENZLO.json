  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Individual horizons are often dominated by very soft clay shale that easily disintegrates to a silty clay loam texture.  In a few pedons, bridging of rock fragments by fine earth material forms small voids.  Isolated peds of relict genetic horizons of premined soils are randomly distributed throughout, and are disordered relative to any plane in the profile.  Content is less than 3 percent by volume.  Some of the peds have identifiable properties such as redox concentrations and depletions, clay films or other coatings that are characteristic of their previous formation.  The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth because of mixing and the presence of coal and other carbonaceous material.  The control section ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline to a depth of 60 inches.  The particle size control section ranges from 22 to 35 percent clay.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Rock fragments are disordered relative to any plane in the profile and commonly are shale channers but include pebbles, stones and small boulders.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 3.  It commonly is silty clay loam but includes silt loam, and the gravelly or channery analogs.\nThe middle and lower parts of the series control section (C horizons) have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It commonly is silty clay loam but includes silt loam and clay loam.  Individual layers within the C horizon are variable in number and thickness.  Thin strata or small pockets of coarser or finer textured material are in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lenzlo soils are on summits and shoulders of broad rises on reconstructed flood plain landscapes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 7 percent.  These soils formed in cast overburden material from surface mining that consists of a mixture of alluvium and fragments of shale bedrock.  Mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beaucoup, Tice, Titus, and Wakeland soils on adjacent or nearby unmined landscapes.  The poorly drained Beaucoup and Titus soils and somewhat poorly drained Tice soils have a mollic epipedon.  Tice and Wakeland soils are on broad rises, and Beaucoup and Titus soils are in low-lying areas on the flood plain."

Flooding from stream overflow is occasional during the spring.  These soils have an apparent water table at a depth of 1.0 to 3.0 feet below the surface during the spring in most years."
