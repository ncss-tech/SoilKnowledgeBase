  "OVERVIEW": "The Library series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum of calcareous shale and thin bedded impure limestone. They are on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Mean annual precipitation is about 1000 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 10.7 degrees C.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the Bt and Btg horizons, 0 to 30 percent in the BC horizon, and from 5 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is very strongly through neutral in the solum, strongly acid through mildly alkaline immediately below the solum and moderately acid to moderately alkaline at greater depths. Depth to carbonates ranges from 50 to 150 centimeters or more.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry values are 6 or higher. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have thin BA or BE horizons with silty clay loam textures.\nThe Bt horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and dominant chroma of 0 to 2. Some thin subhorizons have chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, grayish brown, reddish brown or yellowish brown. The Bt horizon is dominantly silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction with 45 to 60 percent clay. Some subhorizons can have textures of silty clay loam, but the control section average is 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe BC and C horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Some pedons have thin subhorizons with value of 2 or 3. It ranges from silt loam to clay in the fine-earth fraction."
