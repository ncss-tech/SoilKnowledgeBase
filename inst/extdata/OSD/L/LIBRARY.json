  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 65 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the Bt and Btg horizons, 0 to 30 percent in the BC horizon, and from 5 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is very strongly through neutral in the solum, strongly acid through mildly alkaline immediately below the solum and moderately acid to moderately alkaline at greater depths. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches or more.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry values are 6 or higher. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have thin BA or BE horizons with silty clay loam textures.\nThe Bt horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and dominant chroma of 0 to 2. Some thin subhorizons have chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, grayish brown, reddish brown or yellowish brown. The Bt horizon is dominantly silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction with 45 to 60 percent clay. Some subhorizons can have textures of silty clay loam, but the control section average is 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe BC and C horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Some pedons have thin subhorizons with value of 2 or 3. It ranges from loam to silty clay in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Randolph is the only other soil in this family.  It has bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Savona is in a related family and may become a competitor as its classification is updated to the eighth edition.  Savona soils contain rounded gravels and are formed from glacial outwash.\nCaneadea, Cavode, Evendale and Guernsey series are in related families. Caneadea soils have illitic clay mineralogy. Cavode and Evendale have less than 35 percent base saturation. Guernsey soils do not have redoximorphic features  and chroma of 2 or less immediately below the A horizon."

This soil formed in materials weathered from calcareous shale and thin bedded impure limestone. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F."
