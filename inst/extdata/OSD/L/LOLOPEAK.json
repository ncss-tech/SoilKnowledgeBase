    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lolopeak soils are on mountain slopes.  Elevations are 6,500 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes are 50 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium or glacial till derived from granite and gneiss.  Lolopeak soils have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters and moist springs.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 80, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain.  Mean annual temperature is 33 to 36 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 40 days."

Lolopeak soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Dystrocryepts to Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Humicryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
