  "OVERVIEW": "The Leadore series consists of very deep and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite.  Leadore soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate over very rapid. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
