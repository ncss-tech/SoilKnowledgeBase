  "OVERVIEW": "The Lankin series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in lacustrine sediments overlying till.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and in interbeach areas and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically, a sandy, gravelly, or stony layer is at the contact between the friable loam lacustrine material and the firm loam or clay loam till material.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 2, 3, or 4 dry; and chroma of 1.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons do not have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2Bk or Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are loam or clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has few to many distinct to prominent mottles.  It is firm loam or clay loam.  It contains 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments.\nCOMPETING SERIES  These are the Aastad, Darnen, Delette, Lismore, Svea, and Walsh series in the same family and the Emrick, Gardena, Kittson, and Wyard series.  Aastad soils have Bw horizons averaging between 28 and 35 percent clay and moderate to strong prismatic structure and have formed entirely in till.  Darnen soils do not have mottles with low chroma in the Bw horizon and formed in colluvial sediments.  Delette soils do not have carbonates and formed in alluvium or colluvium.  Lismore soils formed in silt mantle over friable till.  Svea soils formed in friable loam till and do not have mottles with low chroma in the Bw horizon.  Walsh soils formed in shaly materials and do not have Bk horizons or mottles with low chroma in the Bw horizon.  Emrick soils are coarse-loamy.  Gardena soils are coarse-silty.  Kittson soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Wyard soils have an aquic moisture regime."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lankin soils are on level and nearly level glacial lake plains and interbeach areas.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in lacustrine sediments, 20 to 40 inches thick, over till.  The climate is cool and subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 22 inches.  Most of the moisture comes in the spring and summer."

Gardena soils are on nearby areas of the lake plain where the lacustrine sediments are more than 40 inches thick.  Embden and Towner soils are on higher lying beach and lake areas where sand deposits are thicker.  Gilby soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  They are in slight depressions adjacent to the Lankin soils.  Kratka and Tiffany soils are wetter and are in nearby swales and depressions.  In addition, Tiffany soils are coarse-loamy.  Tonka and Vallers soils are on lower lying glacial ground moraines and have formed in clay loam glacial till.  Tonka soils have albic and argillic horizons.  Vallers soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches."
