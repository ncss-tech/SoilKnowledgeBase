  "OVERVIEW": "The Labuck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granodiorite with an influence of ash and loess in the surface. Labuck soils are on hillslopes of uplands and have slopes of 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
