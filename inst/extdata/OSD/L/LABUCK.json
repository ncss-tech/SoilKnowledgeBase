  "OVERVIEW": "The Labuck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granodiorite with an influence of ash and loess in the surface. Labuck soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 44 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer. The solum is 10 to 30 inches thick and the depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. Hue of the solum is 10YR or 7.5YR. Volume of rock fragments, dominantly fine gravel, ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the A horizon and 15 to 35 percent in the B and C horizons. The particle size control section is loam to coarse sandy loam and averages 10 to 18 percent clay. The upper 7 to 14 inches is estimated to have a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 2 to 4 dry. It has weak or moderate medium subangular blocky structure."

The mean July temperature is 60 degree F.; the mean January temperature is 30 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation 20 to 26 inches.
