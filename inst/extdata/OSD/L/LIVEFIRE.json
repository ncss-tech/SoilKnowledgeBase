    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amole (T AZ), Hypoint (T NV), Orwash (NV), Redington (AZ) and Yellowrock (CA) series. Amole soils contain a high content of biotite and magnetite and are moist for more than 20 days, cumulative, in some part of the moisture control section between July and October. Hypoint soils have strata within the control section which contain more than 35 percent rock fragments. Additionally, Hypoint soils do not allow strata with sandy loam textures within the particle-size control section. Orwash soils are dominated by coarse sands and 2 to 5 mm gravel and have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 63 degrees F. Redington soils have brittle dense layers and more than 20 percent rock fragments in all horizons. Yellowrock soils have a moisture control section that is moist in some part more than half the time, cumulative, that the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F."

Elevations are 1,600 to 3,200 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."
