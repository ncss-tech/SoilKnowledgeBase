  "STATES": "CO,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Louviers series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from noncalcareous shale.  Louviers soils are on hills and ridges where shale occurs close to the surface.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent but typically is more than 90 percent.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam or clay, and averages 35 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume, but are generally less than 5 percent.  They range from 1/4 to 1 inch in length.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

The soils formed in thin parent materials weathered from noncalcareous shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 125 to 140 days."
