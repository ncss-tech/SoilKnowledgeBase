The control section is usually heavy clay loam or clay, and averages 35 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume, but are generally less than 5 percent.  They range from 1/4 to 1 inch in length.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

The soils formed in thin parent materials weathered from noncalcareous shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 125 to 140 days."
