  "REVDATE": "04/2011",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostpeak series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy residuum and colluvium weathered from Permian Limestone and Dolomite bedrock. Slopes range from 40 to 95 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
