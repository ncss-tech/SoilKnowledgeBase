  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Labounty soils are on glaciomarine drift plains and occupy the depressional position in the kame-kettle topography at elevations of 50 to 600 feet.  These soils formed in glaciomarine drift with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  Labounty soils are in a marine climate with warm dry, summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
