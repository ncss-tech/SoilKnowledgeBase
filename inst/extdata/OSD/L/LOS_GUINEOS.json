Oxic horizon - zone from 8 to 79 centimeters (3 to 31 inches, Bto horizons).\n3. Non-Argillic horizon - zone from 8 to 203 centimeters (3 to 80 inches, Bto, Bt, and BCt horizons).\n4. Clay illuviation evidence is present but according to Soil Taxonomy and Lab data does not meet the required characteristics for the argillic or kandic horizons. This horizon needs at least 8 percent or more (absolute) clay than above horizon if that horizon has more than 40 percent total clay in the fine-earth fraction."
