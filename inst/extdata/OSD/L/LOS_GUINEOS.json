Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the profile.  The lower depth of the Oxic horizon is above 50 inches.  Stones and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bo horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is clay (using either 2.5 or 3 times the 15 bar water).  Because of poor dispersion, the measured clay content ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  Saprolite ranges from 0 to 20 percent, by volume, in the lower part."
