  "OVERVIEW": "The Los Guineos series consists of very deep, well drained soils on side slopes of mountains.  They formed in residuum from sandstone material. The mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the profile.  The lower depth of the Oxic horizon is above 50 inches.  Stones and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bo horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is clay (using either 2.5 or 3 times the 15 bar water).  Because of poor dispersion, the measured clay content ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  Saprolite ranges from 0 to 20 percent, by volume, in the lower part."
