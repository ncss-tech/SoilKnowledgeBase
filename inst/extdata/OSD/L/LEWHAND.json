  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewhand series consists of shallow to a fragipan, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with an admixture of volcanic ash. They are in drainageways and small basins. Permeability is very slow and slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

A perched water table is present at +9 inches to 4 inches from February to April and 9 to 20 inches from October through July.  An apparent water table is also present in this soil.  Typically it has a phreatic surface at 7 to 28 inches from February through June and 11 to 56 inches from July through January, but is usually confined below a fragipan."
