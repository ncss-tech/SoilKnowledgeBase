    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lewhand soils are in drainageways and small basins at elevations of 2,900 to 3,400 feet. These soils formed in mixed alluvium with an admixture of volcanic ash. The slope range is 0 to 3 percent. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches and the frost free season is 50 to 110 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burntcreek, Gramil and Reggear series. Burntcreek soils are in drainageways and small basins, have a mollic epipedon and lack a fragipan. Gramil soils are on lacustrine terraces, and have an abrupt textural change at 20 to 40 inches. Reggear soils are on hills, have a fragipan at 20 to 40 inches and have mixed volcanic ash and loess in the epipedon."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; runoff is slow; permeability is very slow.  This soil is subject to frequent flooding for long periods from December to March.  A perched water table is present at +9 inches to 4 inches from February to April and 9 to 20 inches from October through July.  An apparent water table is also present in this soil.  Typically it has a phreatic surface at 7 to 28 inches from February through June and 11 to 56 inches from July through January, but is usually confined below a fragipan."
