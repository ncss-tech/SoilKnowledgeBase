  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the A and B horizons is less than 20 inches.  Few to common shells are in most pedons.  Sulfur content is less than 0.75 percent throughout the soil.  Depth to the R horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value of 4 through 7.  Carbonates as gypsum are more than 15 percent and commonly more than 45 percent.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand but where texture is fine sandy loam, the depth to the Cr horizon is greater than 14 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw/Bh horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Organic matter depletions in shade of gray range from few to many.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Hard limestone fragments occur randomly throughout the horizon and range from about 20 to 35 percent by volume.  Solution holes in this layer range from none to about three in each pedon and where present, are filled with loamy fine sand and fragments of hard limestone.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard limestone that cannot be dug with a spade."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lacoochee soils are in broad tidal marshes.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments overlying soft and hard limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location the average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aripeka, Homosassa, Wabasso, and Weekiwachee series.  The somewhat poorly drained Aripeka soils are on higher positions, are moderately deep to limestone, and have argillic horizons.  The very poorly drained Homosassa soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep to limestone, and have high sulfur content.  The very poorly or poorly drained Wabasso soils are on higher positions and are very deep.  The very poorly drained Weekiwachee soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep to limestone, and are Histosols."
