  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakepark series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy colluvium from glacial drift and underlying loamy glacial till on till plains and moraines. These soils have moderately slow permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

Coarse fragments are typically not present in the upper part but range form 0 to 5 percent by volume. The lower part has 2 to 8 percent rock fragments by volume. The soil moisture control section is dry 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam or silt loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2, It has few through many redoximorphic features in some to all parts. It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bk horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly has redoximorphic features in all parts. It is clay loam or loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from glacial drift and underlying loamy glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1,800 feet above sea level."
