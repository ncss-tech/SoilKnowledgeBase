  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to carbonates ranges from 25 to 50 inches. The mollic epipedon typically is 24 to 40 inches thick but ranges to 60 inches thick in some pedons. Coarse fragments are typically not present in the upper part but range form 0 to 5 percent by volume. The lower part has 2 to 8 percent rock fragments by volume. The soil moisture control section is dry 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam or silt loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2, It has few through many redoximorphic features in some to all parts. It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bk horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly has redoximorphic features in all parts. It is clay loam or loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Eagleton and Welch soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 35 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice in most years. Kovich soils have a skeletal lithologic discontinuity in the particle-size control section. Mannixlee soils have skeletal material below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lakepark soils are on lower footslopes, toeslopes, and drainways on glacial moraines and till plains. Slopes are plane or concave with 0 to 3 percent gradients. These soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from glacial drift and underlying loamy glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1,800 feet above sea level."

Aazdahl soils are moderately well drained and are higher lying. Flom soils are poorly drained soils and have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick. Quam soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions."
