  "OVERVIEW": "The La Roco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. La Roco soils are on flood plains and flood plain steps and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
