The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The soil lacks rock fragments to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Hue is 10YR to 7.5YR.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The values of 15-bar water range from about 18 to 25 percent in individual horizons within the particle-size control section.  The bulk density in the solum ranges from about .50 to .85 g/cm cubic.  The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils are formed in alluvium weathered mostly from sedimentary rocks.  The climate is humid and marine in character with 60 to 80 inches of precipitation.  The mean January temperature is 44 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 58 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."

Fendall soils are on adjacent uplands and are 20 to 40 inches deep to partially weathered shale.  Templeton soils are on adjacent uplands and are fine-silty and underlain by sandstone bedrock."

This reclassification is based on addition of the Andisol Order to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from 2 to 18 inches (A1, A2, and AB horizons).\nCambic horizon - from 18 to 44 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nMedial - solum dominated by andic soil properties.\nAll diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for two profiles S72 Oreg.  10-1(1-6) and S72 Oreg. 20-1(1-7) by SCS Riverside Laboratory reported in computer printouts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
