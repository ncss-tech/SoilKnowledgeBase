  "OVERVIEW": "The Logtrain series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  Logtrain soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 110 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 72 inches, (1829 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, (12 degrees C).",
