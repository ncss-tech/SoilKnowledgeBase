They formed in slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,900 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
