  "OVERVIEW": "The Letrado series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff.  Letrado soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of interfluves on undulating plateaus. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
