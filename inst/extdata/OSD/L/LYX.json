  "OVERVIEW": "The Lyx series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium of dominantly volcanic rocks.  Lyx soils are on inset fans, alluvial fans and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
