Labkey and Pumper soils lack summer precipitation, in addition Labkey soils contain 3 to 9 percent clay in the particle-size control section and contain 15 to 30 percent gravel size fragments mainly 2 to 5 mm across and of granitic origin.  Toulon soils lack summer precipitation and have 15 to 30 percent cobbles as well as relict oxide mottles in the substratum."

They formed in alluvium derived mainly from intermediate volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
