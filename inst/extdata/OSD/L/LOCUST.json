  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 4 feet.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  Depth to the fragipan\nranges from 16 to 30 inches.  Sandstone, shale, quartzite, and\nchert pebbles or fragments are present in some pedons, but the content is less than 15 percent of individual horizons within the solum.  Small soft brown and black bodies range from few to many throughout the pedon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid except for the A horizon where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam with gravelly phases recognized.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silt\nloam, or light clay loam.  The B2t horizon has more than 20\npercent silt and from 18 to 35 percent clay.  Clay films are not consistently visible on either vertical or horizontal ped faces.\nThe Bx horizons are distinctly or prominently mottled with shades\nof gray, yellow, brown, or red.  Some pedons have matrix colors in hues of 10YR or yellower.  Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy\nloam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  The upper 6\ninches of the fragipan contains a discontinuous A horizon\ncomprised mostly of clean, light gray, or gray sand grains.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and\nred.  It is cherty clay loam, cherty sandy loam, or cherty loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.\nSimilar soils are the Cane, Dickson, Sango, Vaucluse, and\nWynnville series.  Cane and Vaucluse soils have siliceous\nmineralogy and have argillic horizons with clay films on vertical\nand horizontal faces of peds above the fragipans.  Dickson and Wynnville soils have siliceous mineralogy.  In addition, Dickson soils have control sections above the fragipans with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand."
