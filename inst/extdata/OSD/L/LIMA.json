  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lima series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. They are nearly level to moderately steep soils formed in till that is strongly influenced by limestone and calcareous shale. The till may be dense. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high within the solum, but is low through moderately high in the underlying substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 29 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 15 through 32 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 through 30 percent, by volume, in the solum and from 20 through 50 percent in the substratum, and includes 3 through 10 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Unless limed, reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the solum and it is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum. Higher reactions in the solum are more common in the lower part of the B horizon which may be calcareous in some pedons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate medium or fine granular structure, and friable or very friable consistence.\nSome pedons have a thin E or BE horizon.\nThe Bt/E horizon has properties like the Bt horizon in the interiors of the peds. The E portion has hue of 10YR with value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 2 or 3. Redoximorphic features with high chroma may or may not be present. Thin E/B horizons are present above the B/E horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It has few through many distinct or prominent high chroma redoximorphic concentrations. Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction, with the average clay content ranging from 18 to 28 percent. The Bt horizon has weak or moderate, fine through coarse blocky or subangular blocky, and/or very coarse prismatic structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a BC horizon, with colors and textures similar to the B and C horizon.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive, or has weak or moderate medium or thick plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable through very firm. Some pedons have a firm C horizon above the Cd horizon. Other pedons have a 2C and 3C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cadmus, Colescreek, and Gageville series. Cadmus soils contain a thin covering of glaciofluvial deposits over till. The Colescreek soils are formed in alluvium. The Gageville soils has a solum that is deeper than 35 inches and carbonates deeper than 40 inches.\nThe Aurora, Cazenovia, Conesus, Danley, Hilton, Honeoye, Lansing, Ontario, Nunda, Wampsville, and Wassaic are series in similar families. Aurora and Wassaic soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Cazenovia soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the control section. Conesus, Danley, and Nunda soils have 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon. Hilton soils have solum that is deeper than 29 inches. Honeoye, Lansing, and Ontario soils lack the high-chroma concentrations typical of the Bt horizon of Lima soils. Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

The soil formed in till derived from limestone and calcareous shale. The till is sometimes dense. Calcium carbonate equivalent is mainly between 15 and 45 percent of the fine earth fraction in the substratum. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 45 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees through 50 degrees F., and the mean frost-free season ranges from 120 through 180 days.

Other associates are the Aurora, Collamer, Conesus, Dunkirk, Hudson, Madalin, Niagara, Palmyra, and Rhinebeck soils. Aurora soils are in nearby areas where bedrock is within 40 inches of the soil surface. Collamer, Dunkirk and Niagara soils are in adjacent silty lacustrine sediments. Conesus soils are in areas were the depth to carbonates is deeper. Hudson, Rhinebeck and Madalin are on nearby clayey lacustrine plains. Palmyra soils are on adjacent well drained outwash terraces."

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 25 inches (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic subgroup - Is saturated with water in one or more layers within 100 cm. of the mineral surface for more than 30 cumulative days in normal years (Bt horizons redoximorphic features).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
