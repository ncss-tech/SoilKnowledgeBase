  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent of the volume between depths of 10 and 40 inches and from 10 to 60 percent below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Ap on A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam through silty clay loam with a weighted clay content of 18 to 28 percent in the particle-size control section and have 10 percent or more rock fragments in the lower part. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm. High chroma redoximorphic concentrations ranging from few to many occur immediately below the Ap horizon and range from common to many at greater depths. Redoximorphic depletions may occur, also. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with or without redox concentrations of higher chroma. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Alden series is in the same family. Alden soils have carbonates at depths of more than 40 inches.\nThe Canandaigua, Edmore, Jeddo, Kendaia, Massena, Sun and Tappan series are in related families. Canandaigua soils have fine-silty, Edmore soils have coarse-loamy and Jeddo soils have fine particle-size control sections. Kendaia, Massena and Sun soils have between the A or Ap horizon and 30 inches a subhorizon that has more than 40 percent of the matrix with chroma of 3 or more. Tappan soils are calcareous in all parts below a depth of 10 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lyons soils are on nearly level areas or concave depressions within undulating to rolling till plains. Slope is mainly less than 1 percent, but they are locally as much as 4 percent where wetness is due to seepage water. The soils developed in calcareous till derived from limestone, calcareous shale, and calcareous sandstone. Many areas have a mantle of silty or very fine sand local alluvium or lacustrine sediments, 14 to 24 inches thick. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches; mean annual temperature from 46 degrees to 50 degrees F; and mean frost-free period ranges from 140 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 1300 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Original classification placed Lyons in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes in the 5th edition to Keys to Soil Taxonomy this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. CEC reaction class was added as active. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Cambic horizon - from 9 to 36 inches (Bg1, Bg2, and 2BCg horizons).\n3) Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime evidenced by low chroma matrix color with mottles within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nSoil Interpretation Record No: NY0104, NY0105\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
