  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewnot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
