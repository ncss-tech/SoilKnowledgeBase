  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakeland series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapid to very rapidly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in thick beds of eolian or marine and/or fluvio-marine sands in the Southern Coastal Plain MLRA (133A), the Carolina and Georgia Sandhills (MLRA 137), the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A) and the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A).Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes are dominantly from 0 to 12 percent but can range to 85 percent in dissected areas.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of l to 4. Uncoated sand grains with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2 ranges from none to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have an A/C horizon that is a mixture in shades of gray, yellow, and brown. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Horizons with chroma of 2 are not indicative of wetness.  Small pockets of sand grains in shades of gray not related to wetness or masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow or brown may occur in some pedons below depths of 40 inches."

Alaga and Darden soils have 10 to 25 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40-inch control section.  In addition, Darden soils have weakly expressed cambic horizons.  Bigbee soils are on lower adjacent positions that are subject to flooding and have a water table 20 to 40 inches below the surface for short periods.  Cainhoy soils have a spodic horizon below 80 inches.  The moderately well to somewhat excessively drained Foxworth soils are on lower positions.  McNeely soils have weakly developed cambic horizons.  Tonkawa soils have a moisture control section that is dry for 125-150 cumulative days for most years. The somewhat excessively drained Turkey soils have 10 to 18 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40-inch control section.  The well drained Wando soils have 5 to 20 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40-inch control section."

Slopes are dominantly 0 to 12 percent but may range up to 85 percent in highly dissected areas.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 71 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 60 inches."

The somewhat poorly drained Albany soils are on lower adjacent positions and have an argillic horizon 40 to 80 below the surface. Alpin soils are on similar positions and have lamellae that are generally less than 5 mm in thickness below a depth of 40 inches. The moderately well to somewhat excessively drained Blanton and the well-drained Bonifay soils have an argillic horizon in shades of yellow 40 to 80 inches below the surface. The moderately well drained Centenary soils are on lower positions and have spodic horizons.  The well drained Chipola and Lucy soils have an argillic horizon 20 to 40 inches below the surface. The somewhat poorly drained Chipley soils are on lower positions.  The somewhat excessively drained Eglin soils have a spodic horizon 68 to 80 inches below the surface. Kershaw and Kureb soils have less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40-inch control section.  In additions, Kureb soils have weakly developed spodic horizons. The well to somewhat excessively drained Lucknow soils are on lower positions and have a seasonal high water table between 40 and 72 inches below the surface.  The poorly drained Osier and Plummer soils are in lower adjacent drainageways.  In addition, Plummer soils have an argillic horizon 40 to 80 inches below the surface.  The somewhat excessively drained Troup soils occur are on similar to lower positions and have an argillic horizon within 40 to 80 inches of the surface.  The somewhat excessively drained Wakulla soils have a weakly expressed argillic horizon within the control section."
