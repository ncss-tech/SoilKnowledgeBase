  "OVERVIEW": "The Linkletter series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils on rounded hills and high terraces.  They formed in older alluvium that has some loess influence.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 8 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
