Based on the definition of contrasting particle-size class, a contrasting layer 5 inches thick within the 40 inch particle-size control section, is the minimum requirement needed. Those Littlebald soils with an ash mantle less than 36 inches meeting andic soil properties, will be considered a taxadjunct to the series.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for this pedon; sample number S94WA-077-004, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
