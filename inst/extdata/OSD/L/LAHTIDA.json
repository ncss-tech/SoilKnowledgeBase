Texture is loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is clay loam or clay and less commonly sandy clay loam. Weighted average clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.
