  "OVERVIEW": "The Lahtida series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft bedrock. They formed in residuum and local slope alluvium derived from tuff and claystone on gently sloping hills and pediments. Slopes are 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Texture is loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is clay loam or clay and less commonly sandy clay loam. Weighted average clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.
