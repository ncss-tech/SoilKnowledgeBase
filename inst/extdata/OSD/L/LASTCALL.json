  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lastcall series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt. Lastcall soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
