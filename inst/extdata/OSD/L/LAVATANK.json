  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavatank series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits in the upper part of residuum weathered from aa lava or cinders derived from volcanic rock. The Lavatank soils are on cinder cones and \"aa\" lava flows. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
