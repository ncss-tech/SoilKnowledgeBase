Littlehat soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone and shale.  Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 5,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Nataani soils are coarse-silty, have gypsic horizons, and occur on toeslopes below Littlehat soils.  Persayo soils are shallow to bedrock. Ravola soils are very deep, stratified, and occur on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Tsebitai soils are very deep, coarse-silty, and occur on fan terraces."
