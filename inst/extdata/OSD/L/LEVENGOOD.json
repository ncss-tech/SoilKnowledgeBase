  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Levengood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from calcareous sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants, hills, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
