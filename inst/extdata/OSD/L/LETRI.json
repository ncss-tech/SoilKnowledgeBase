  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness.  These soils lack or have an upper sediment that is less than 30 inches thick and it overlies glacial till.  The upper sediment contains from 0 to 4 percent by volume of coarse fragments and the glacial till contains 2 to 8 percent of coarse fragments.  A stone line ranging to as much as 4 inches in thickness and containing up to 40 percent by volume of coarse fragments commonly is at the contact of the two sediments.  The coarse fragments are of mixed lithology.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages between 24 and 33 percent clay and typically 20 to 30 percent of fine sand and coarser and ranging from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue to 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is neutral to slighlty alkaline.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue to 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg horizon has hue to 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe 2C or 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or less commonly 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or loam averaging between 25 and 33 percent clay. It is slighlty alkaline or moderately alkaline and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 12 to 20 percent.  The moist bulk density is 1.6 to 1.8 g/cc.  The moist consistency is typically firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clyde, Faxon, Marengo, Selma, Selmass, Tripoli, and Webster series.  Clyde soils have carbonates below depths of 45 inches.  Faxon soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Marengo soils have carbonates below depths of 40 inches.  Selma and Selmass soils do not have firm glacial till in the lower third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of less than 2 percent on dissected ground moraines. They typically formed in a thin layer of erosional sediments that apparently are mixed with loess at least in some places or loamy ablation till.  These sediments are underlain by calcareous, firm, loam or clay loam till.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 145 to 160.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1,200 feet above sea level."
