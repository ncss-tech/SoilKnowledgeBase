The moisture control section of 6 to 18 inches is moist throughout from about November 15 to June 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to October 15 in most years.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from December 15 to March 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 57 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Typically, cobbles and stones range from 0 to 5 percent in the profile but some pedons have up to 10 percent cobbles and stones in the A horizon with 3 to 15 percent stones on the surface.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the upper 10 inches.
