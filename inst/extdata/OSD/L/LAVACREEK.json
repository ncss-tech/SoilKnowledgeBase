  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavacreek series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium. Lavacreek soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 6 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Dollarhide soils are lithic and occur on ridgetops and convex north and east-facing mountainsides. Drage soils have a Bk horizon and occur on fan terraces. Grassycone soils are medial-skeletal. Ketchum soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur on steep timbered north and east-facing mountainsides. Milligan and Vitale soils are moderately deep and occur on south and west-facing mountainsides. Povey soils are pachic and lack the influence of volcanic ash and occur on north and east-facing mountainsides."
