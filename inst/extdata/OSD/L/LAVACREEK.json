    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lavacreek soils are on steep mountainsides. Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 9,300 feet. The soil formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium. The average annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, most of which falls as snow or early fall or late spring rains. The average annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is 30 to 70 days."

Blackspar soils are lithic and lack a mollic epipedon and occur on south and west-facing mountainsides. Dollarhide soils are lithic and occur on ridgetops and convex north and east-facing mountainsides. Drage soils have a Bk horizon and occur on fan terraces. Grassycone soils are medial-skeletal. Ketchum soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur on steep timbered north and east-facing mountainsides. Milligan and Vitale soils are moderately deep and occur on south and west-facing mountainsides. Povey soils are pachic and lack the influence of volcanic ash and occur on north and east-facing mountainsides."
