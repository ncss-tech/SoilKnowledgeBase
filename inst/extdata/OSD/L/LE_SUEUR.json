    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 22 to 55 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches. Rock fragment content is 1 to 8 percent by volume throughout and is of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A horizon is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. It has 20 to 30 percent clay. It is moderately acid to neutral. An E horizon as much as 3 inches thick is in some pedons.\nThe AB horizon has characteristics similar to the A and the Bt.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The lower part of the Bt horizon has a hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Bt horizon is mostly clay loam or loam. The argillic horizon averages between 24 and 35 percent clay and from 15 to 40 percent fine sand or coarser. The Bt horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part. The bulk density ranges from 1.30 to 1.45 gm/cc.\nSome pedons have a BC or Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The bulk density ranges from 1.45 to 1.60 gm/cc."

The Aurand(T) and Tiderishi series are presently not in the OSD file. The Andres, Aztalan, and Mokena soils have silty clay loam lower B and C horizons. Aztalan soils also have hue of 7.5YR in the B and C horizons. Crane soils have more than 8 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Darroch soils have C horizons of stratified silty and sandy sediments within the series control section. Gilboa soils have silt loam and silty clay loam in the upper part of the series control section. Houstenader soils have 30 to 40 percent gravel in the lower third of the series control section. La Hogue soils have less than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Marcellon soils have less than 24 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Nachusa soils do not have rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Nenno soils have more than 8 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Newhaven soils do not have carbonates in the series control section. Odell soils have hue of 10YR in the lower B and C horizons and higher chroma in the upper B horizon. Protivin soils have bulk density greater than 1.60 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section. Vigar soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 24 inches thick.

They formed in a calcareous, loamy till. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 125 to 165 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cordova, Lester, and Hamel soils. These soils formed in materials similar to the Le Sueur soils and are members of a hydrosequence with the Le Sueur soils. The poorly drained Cordova and Hamel soils are common associates on adjacent nearly level slopes. The well drained Lester soils are the most common associate on the undulating to gently undulating slopes. The well drained Hayden soils and the poorly drained Dundas soils are associates in some places."
