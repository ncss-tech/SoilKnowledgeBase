  "OVERVIEW": "The Leroux soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils on mountain and valley side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale and basalt.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches and mean annual air temperature is 37 degrees F.",
