  "OVERVIEW": "The Leroux soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils on mountain and valley side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale and basalt.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 740 mm and mean annual air temperature is 3 degrees C.",
