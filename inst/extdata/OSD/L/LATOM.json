  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Latom series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum weathered from strongly cemented sandstone. These nearly level to very steep soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of hills on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in), and mean annual temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",

Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches.\nThe pedon does not have a diagnostic subsurface horizon.\nLithic contact of sandstone at 8 inches.\nOther features: The soil is calcareous throughout.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014"
