Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches.\nThe pedon does not have a diagnostic subsurface horizon.\nLithic contact of sandstone at 8 inches.\nOther features: The soil is calcareous throughout.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
