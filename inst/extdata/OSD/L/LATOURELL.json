    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days during the 120-day period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 56 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches. The solum is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam with 18 to 22 percent clay based on values of 15-bar water and has more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has weak or moderate structure. Clay films range from few to common and thin to moderately thick.\nAt depths of 40 to 60 inches the IIC2 horizon is sandy loam with 25 to 60 percent pebbles and a few embedded stones or cobbles."

Boomer, Centralia, Cohasset, Fives, Holland, Kalama, Musick and Varelum soils have more than 22 percent clay in the B2t horizon. Also, Boomer, Cohasset, Holland and Musick soils have hue redder than 10YR in the B2t horizon. Cherryhill soils have an umbric epipedon. Cle Elum, Crozier, Hotaw and Speaker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Hood soils have argillic horizons with coatings of clean sand grains on faces of peds and are brittle and firm in the lower part.  Underwood soils have a hue of 7.5YR or redder in the control section.  Wilkeson has more than 15 percent rock fragments on the control section."

Slopes are mainly 0 to 8 percent, but some slopes on terrace fronts and along drainageways are as much as 30 percent.\nThe soils formed in medium textured mixed alluvium. The climate is humid temperature. Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees to 54 degrees F. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."
