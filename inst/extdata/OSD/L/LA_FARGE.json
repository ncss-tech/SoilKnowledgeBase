  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The La Farge series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone and are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  They formed mostly in loess and in residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone.  Permeability is moderate in the loess and in the residuum and ranges from slow to moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15% fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments are absent in the loess mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the residuum. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors with moist value of 3 have dry value of 6 or more.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or 5G; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 8.  Bands of 5Y 2/2 glauconite are common."

Related soils are the Gale and Norden series.  Marseilles, Mayville, Minnith, and Uniontown soils will be reclassified as Oxyaquic Hapludalfs. None of the other soils, except Westbend, Gale, and Norden, have a paralithic contact with sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Westbend soils have a paralithic contact with interbedded siltstone and shale at 40 to 60 inches. Gale soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Norden soils are fine-loamy."
