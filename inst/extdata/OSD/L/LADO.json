  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lado series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thick mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium derived from granite or gneiss. They are on mountain slopes, hills, benches, ridges and summits. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 1,025 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
