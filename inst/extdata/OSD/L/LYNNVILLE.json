  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Fragments of chert are less than 5 percent in most pedons, but ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is dominantly slightly acid to mildly alkaline throughout, but ranges to medium acid.  Some pedons have transitional horizons with color and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 with mottles in shades of brown and gray.  In some pedons the Bw horizon has no matrix color but is mottled in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or rarely loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 with mottles in shades of brown and gray or has no matrix color but is mottled in shades of yellow, brown and gray. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or rarely loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Lynnville is the only soil in this family. Soils in similar families are the Egam, Godwin, Lanton, Cannon, and Staser series.  All of these soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  In addition, Egam and Godwin soils are clayey, Lanton soils are poorly drained, Cannon soils are gravelly, and Staser soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on stream flood plains,  along upland drainageways and in depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Lynnville soils formed in alluvium transported mainly from soils developed in phosphatic limestone residuum.  In a few places there is some mixture of materials from loess and shale.  Near the type location the mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F."
