  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawrie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flood plains of minor streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 32 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",
