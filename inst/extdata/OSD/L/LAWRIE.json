Depth to secondary carbonate ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline, but ranges to very strongly acid where anhydrous ammonia fertilizer has been used extensively.  Some pedons an overwash of fine sandy loam.  The overwash material is less than 20 inches thick.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Btb horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam or loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Braman, Corbin, Irene, Pond Creek, St.  Paul, and Westview series.  Corbin and Pond Creek soils are on uplands.  Corbin soils have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR in the argillic horizon, and over 35 percent clay in the lower argillic horizon.  Irene, St. Paul, and Westview soils are on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C); these soils have P-E indices of 44 or less and have secondary carbonates within 40 inches of the surface.  Braman soils developed in Pleistocene sediments on high flood plains of major streams."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lawrie soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains in The Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in loamy alluvium of Recent age.  These soils formed along entrenched drains that have been stable in the past, and have gone through several cycles of aggradation and degradation.  Mean Annual Precipitation: 26 to 40 inches. Mean Annual Temperature: 58 to 64 degrees F. Thorthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64. Frost free days: 200 to 230. Elevation: 700 to 1400 feet."

Ashport, Easpur, Port ,Pulaski, and Yahola soils are on  lower elevations of flood plains nearer to the stream. In addition Easpur soils have a fine-loamy control section and Yahola and Pulaski soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Norge and Teller soils are on stream terraces farther from the stream.  In addition, Teller soils have a fine-loamy control section."
