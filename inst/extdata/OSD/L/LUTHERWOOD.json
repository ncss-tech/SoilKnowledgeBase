Assinibone soils have a calcic horizon between 10 to 25 inches (25 to 63 cm).Berlake soils are moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section for at least 30 consecutive days immediately following May 1 and dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 45 consecutive days immediately following July 1 in most years.  Bostwick soils contain about 2 to 20 percent or more of flat mica platelets of sufficient size to influence the soil's physical properties in the sand and silt fractions. Cheesman soils have a paralithic contact at 33 inches (84 cm). Crittenden soils have parent material derived from granite rock and a lithic contact at 50 inches (127 cm). Duffson soils have a lithic contact at 30 inches (76 cm). Eapa, Evanot, Evanston, Joplin, Kenilworth, Kevin, and Reicess soils have visible carbonates below the argillic horizon. Jarre, Peyton, and Turret soils receive peak precipitation in the spring and early summer. Marmath soils have visible carbonates below the argillic horizon and a paralithic contact at 35 inches (89 cm). Sugakool and Telstad soils have visible carbonates in and below the argillic horizon and peak precipitation in spring and early summer. Udecide soils have visible carbonates below the argillic horizon and a paralithic contact at 28 inches (71 cm)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nLutherwood soils are on fan remnants and terraces at elevations of 7,150 to 8,180 feet (2,200 to 2,360 meters).   Slopes range from 2 to 18 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches (381 to 432 mm).  April, May and June are the driest months, with monsoonal pattern rainfall in August, September, and October.  Light to moderate rainfall and snowfall occur during the winter months.  Mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F (5 to 7.2 degrees C).  The average frost-free period is 100 to 119 days."

The Countyline soils are usually on fan remnants, terraces, and footslopes a little higher in the landscape than the Lutherwood soils.  The Tylercreek soils are on backslopes and summits higher in the landscape than either the Countyline or Lutherwood soils."
