    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bendavis and Bender series in the same family, and the Brushy (T), Grimsley, Joppa, Oriskany and Pocono soils in closely related families. Bendavis, Bender, and Brushy soils have lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Grimsley soils have lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Joppa soils have 20 to 40 inch sola and are formed in fluvial outwash on coastal plain terraces. Oriskany soils formed in colluvium from sedimentary rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Pocono soils contain less than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lostcove soils are in coves, or on benches, foot slopes, toe slopes, and colluvial fans that have a concave surface. Slopes are dominantly 15 to 40 percent, but range from 2 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,400 to 3,500 feet. Lostcove soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks that are low in weatherable minerals.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 46 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 100 to 150 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

Chestoa, Cataska, Harmiller, Jeffrey, Shinbone, Soco, Sylco, and Unicoi soils formed in residuum on nearby ridges and side slopes. Additionally Cataska and Unicoi soils are in a shallow family and Chestoa, Ditney, Harmiller, Jeffrey, Soco and Sylco soils are moderately deep to lithic or paralithic contact. Keener and Whiteoak soils occur on similar landforms with Lostcove soils but have less rock fragments in the upper layers. Spivey soils are on similar landforms and have an umbric epipedon and mixed mineralogy."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow or slow runoff where forest litter has not been disturbed, and medium to rapid runoff where litter is significantly disturbed or removed; moderate permeability. These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands, and seeps and springs are common."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Lostcove soils are forested. Common trees are northern red oak, yellow-poplar, red maple, sugar maple, Canadian and Carolina hemlock, eastern white pine, scarlet oak, chestnut oak, white oak, and fraser magnolia."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now included with the Lostcove series were previously mapped with Northcove or Spivey soils. Northcove and Spivey soils have a cambic horizon, and in addition, Spivey soils have an umbric epipedon. The total silt content of Lostcove soils ranges from about 35 to 50 percent, the fine silt content is commonly more than 30 percent and the very fine silt content, according to engineering index data, is about 10 to 20 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 15 inches (Oe, A, BA horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 54 inches (Bt horizon)\nLoamy-skeletal feature - average content of more than 35 percent by volume rock fragments in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt horizon)\nSIR = NC0246 MLRA = 130\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; pedon number S88NC-199-011.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
