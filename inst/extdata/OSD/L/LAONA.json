  "OVERVIEW": "The Laona series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to a fragipan. These soils formed in mostly loamy till or glacial mud-flow sediment on drumlins and moraines. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately rapid below the fragipan. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent throughout the soil. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part and in the substratum. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 0 to 20 percent in the lower part and in the substratum.  Stones are on the surface in most pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Typically, it is sandy loam but, in some pedons, it is fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.   Typically, it is sandy loam but, in some pedons, it is fine sandy loam or loam or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Typically, it is gravelly sandy loam or sandy loam but, in some pedons, it is fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nLaona soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the extent to which eluviation has occurred and the depth to the fragipan. Therefore, there can be E/B, E/Bx, B/E, or B/Ex horizons singly or in combination, with or without Bt, Btx,, BC, or BCx horizons.\nThe E' part of the E/B, E/Bx, B/E, or B/Ex horizons has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.\nThe Bt part of the E/B, E/Bx, B/E, or B/Ex horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  It is sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.  In some pedons, thin subhorizons are loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe Btx or Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons with B/E horizons do not have a Btx or Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC or BCx horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Stratification is a common feature (glacial mud-flow sediment) in some pedons.  Individual strata are mostly sandy loam or loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogs but in some pedons, some thin lenses are sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe C horizon has color, texture, and stratification like the BC horizon above."

Related soils are the Argonne, Champion, Sarona, and Wabeno series.  Gogebic soils have hue redder than 7.5YR throughout.  Graveraet soils are less acid than slightly acid in the substratum.  McBride soils are shallow to the fragipan.  Steuben soils average more than 85 percent sand in the series control section within a depth of 40 inches.  Soperton soils have a 12 to 36 inch thick mantle with more than 50 percent silt. Argonne and Wabeno soils have a water table and redox features.  In addition, Wabeno soils have a 12 to 36 inch thick mantle with more than 50 percent silt.  Champion soils do not have an argillic horizon. Sarona soils do not have a fragipan."
