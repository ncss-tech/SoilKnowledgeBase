Elevation ranges from near sea level to 800 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock and influenced by tropospheric dust.  The median annual rainfall is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 72 degrees F. and the median July temperature is 78 degrees F."
