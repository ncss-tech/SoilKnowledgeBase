  "OVERVIEW": "The Lihue series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock and influenced by tropospheric dust.  Lihue soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. The median annual rainfall is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
