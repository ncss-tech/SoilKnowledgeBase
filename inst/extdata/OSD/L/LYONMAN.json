  "OVERVIEW": "The Lyonman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from glassy tuff. Lyonman soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
