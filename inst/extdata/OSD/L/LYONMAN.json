  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Monasterio soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact and have a Btq horizon with silica pendants on undersides of rocks. Tourn soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the profile. (The separation between the Tourn and Lyonman is not distinct, and further investigation is needed)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lyonman soils are on mountains. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from glassy tuff. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 5,300 to 7,500 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Field documentation and local glass counts support the change from fine-loamy, mixed superactive Xeric Argicryolls to ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the mineral soil surface to 18 inches (A1, A2 and the Bt1 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature -- High volcanic glass content in the .02 to 2mm  fraction from the mineral soil surface to 31 inches (A1, A2, Bt1, and the Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 31 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 31 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Crt layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 31 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
