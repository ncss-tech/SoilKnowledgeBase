(Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 12 to 32 inches thick.)\nC -- 26 to 60 inches; 50 percent dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) and 50 percent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; weak thick plate-like divisions; firm; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches and in most areas it is greater than 60 inches. The soil contains few or no rock fragments. Soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral in the solum and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 1 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam to silty clay with mucky analogues. It has weak or moderate or fine subangular blocky or granular structure. Some pedons contain a thin gray Eg horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR in the upper part and 10YR through 5YR in the lower part, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. Chroma on face of peds ranges from 0 through 2. It ranges from silty clay loam to clay. Structure is strong coarse prismatic to strong or moderate medium angular blocky or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is firm or very firm and has plastic or very plastic and sticky or very sticky. It has common or many high or low chroma redoximorphic features.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that is similar to the Bt horizon, but is slightly to moderately alkaline and slightly effervescent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It ranges from silty clay loam to clay and is commonly varved. It is massive or contains weak, medium or thick plate-like divisions inherited from depositional bedding."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Barre series is the only other member of the same family. Barre soils have loam or silt loam C horizons that are lithologic discontinuities.\nKanona, Ilion, Madalin and Romulus series are similar soils in related families. Kanona soils lack an argillic horizon and Madalin soils have a Mollic epipedon. Ilion and Romulus soils have an average clay content of less than 35 percent in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lakemont soils are on nearly level parts and slight depressions of lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in clayey lake-deposited sediments. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation from 28 to 40 inches, and mean growing season from 140 to 190 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained to well drained Schoharie soils, the somewhat poorly drained Odessa soils, and the very poorly drained Fonda soils that occur in a drainage sequence with Lakemont. Also associated are competing Barre and Madalin soils and the Canandaigua, Churchville, and Rhinebeck soils. Canandaigua soils lack argillic horizons and are formed in silty lacustrine deposits. Churchville soils are on higher lying landscapes and formed in relatively thin lacustrine deposits that overlie till. Rhineback soils are somewhat poorly drained and lack a dark colored epipedon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Permeability is moderately slow in the surface and slow and very slow in the subsoil sand substratum."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Areas that have been drained are used mainly for growing hay or pasture, and some corn and small grains. Some undrained areas are pastured, but most are idle or in woods. Woodlots contain American elm, black ash, red maple, and alder."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A. Lakemont was reclassified as Udollic Endoaqualfs at the Subgroup level for 8th Edition of The Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nB. There was no evidence that the series was used in New Jersey. New Jersey was removed from the OSD.\nC. Lakemont as correlated in Cayuga and Wayne Counties, New York classifies as a fine illitic, mesic Typic Argiaquolls.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches. (Ap)\n2. Argillic horizon - 8 to 26 inches. (Btg1 and Btg2)\n3. Aquic moisture regime - 8 to 60 inches. (Btg1, Btg2, Cg)\n4. Udollic subgroup - A layer with all the qualifications of a mollic epipedon except thickness (Ap) and between the bottom of the Ap and a depth of 75cm, a hue 7.5YR or redder and chroma of 2 or more. (Btg1)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
