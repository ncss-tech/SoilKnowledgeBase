  "REVDATE": "07/2002",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonecone series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone and shale, and has some eolian influence.  Lonecone soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
