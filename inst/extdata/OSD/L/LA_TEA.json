  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact with limestone bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The upper few inches of the limestone bedrock is highly fractured in most pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout the profile.  Rock fragments include pebbles, cobbles, and stones composed of limestone.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.    Content of pebbles, cobbles, and stones ranges from 30 to 45 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of pebbles range from 2 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of highly fractured semi-consolidated limestone that can be excavated and is rippable by hand tools.\nThe R horizon is composed of consolidated limestone bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: La Tea soils are on summits and side slopes of limestone hills and mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys of southern Puerto Rico.  They formed in material weathered from limestone bedrock.  The climate is humid tropical.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from about 72 to 78 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Caguabo, Malaya, and Mucara soils. All of these soils are on similar positions. Caguabo and Mucara soils are shallow and moderately deep, respectively, to volcanic rock.  Malaya soils are shallow to calcareous tuffaceous bedrock.  In addition, Caguabo, Malaya, and Mucara soils do not have argillic and mollic horizons."
