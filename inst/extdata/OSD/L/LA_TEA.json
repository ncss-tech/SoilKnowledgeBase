  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The La Tea series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils on summits and side slopes of limestone hills and mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA of southern Puerto Rico.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact with limestone bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The upper few inches of the limestone bedrock is highly fractured in most pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout the profile.  Rock fragments include pebbles, cobbles, and stones composed of limestone.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.    Content of pebbles, cobbles, and stones ranges from 30 to 45 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of pebbles range from 2 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of highly fractured semi-consolidated limestone that can be excavated and is rippable by hand tools.\nThe R horizon is composed of consolidated limestone bedrock."
