  "OVERVIEW": "The Lahood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in local alluvium, colluvium, or residuum over sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, ridges and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
