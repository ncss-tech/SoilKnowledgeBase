Betemer soils have an ustic moisture regime. Cheadle, Starley and Trump soils have accumulation of carbonates above the bedrock.  Clamp soils do not have a Bw horizon and are 10 to 30 cm to lithic contact. Dalys, Dollarhide, Poin and Rogert soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section.  Eyre, Irigul, Jonlake, Mccadden, Irson, Topeki and Udel soils do not have Bw horizons.  Milling soils have Bw with less than 25 percent clay basalt bedrock and have average annual precipitation of 900 to 1400 mm."

Elevations are 2,290 to 3,050 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, which comes mostly as snow; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 45 to 50 days."
