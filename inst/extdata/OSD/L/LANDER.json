  "OVERVIEW": "The Lander series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed, calcareous alluvium.  Lander soils are on stream terraces subject to spring flooding.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous strata ranges from 0 to 22 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. The particle size control section is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam stratified with thin lenses of fine sandy loam, silt loam, and loamy sand.  Clay, when averaged, ranges from 18 to 35 percent, sand from 15 to 50 percent with 15 percent or more being fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent gravel.  The soil is subject to brief flooding from April through August and has a high fluctuating water table at 20 to 40 inches from April through September.  Mottles with high chroma may occur at any depth but always above 30 inches.  EC is 2 mmhos or less throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have buried horizons above 40 inches.\nThe Bw or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Redox concentrations are present in some pedons.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Redoximorphic features are present. Reaction is mildly or  moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have sandy or sandy-skeletal strata below 40 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fairway and Homelake series.  Fairway soils have a Bk horizon, a seasonal water table as deep as 5 feet, elevation from 3800 to 4800 feet, and a frost free period as long as 130 days. Homelake soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 40 inches and occur in areas where the mean annual precipitation is less than 10 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lander soils are on stream terraces and flood plains subject to frequent or occasional flooding from April through August.  These soils formed in calcareous alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes are typically 0 to 3 percent but may range up to 6 percent.  Elevation is 5,000 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is cool and semiarid with cool, dry winters, moist springs, and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and ranges from 10 to 16 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. and ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 75 to 110 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
