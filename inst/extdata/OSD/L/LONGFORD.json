(Bt3 and 2BC horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: at the upper boundary of the 2BC horizon.\nKeys to Taxonomy: Twelth Edition, 2014.\n04/2013 DJK - Updated to meet current MO5 standards (Tech Note 1, revision 4). Added metric conversions, updated climate, and updated landform positions. Added elevation to typical pedon. Added quad and lat/long to type location. Added clay and sand contents, rock fragments, calcium carbonate equivalent, redox to RIC. Added a BA section to RIC. Added Lasita to competing series. Edited parent material and climate in geographic setting. Updated geographically associated soils (deleted Hastings, Hedville, and Hobbs). Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added redox and lithologic discontinuity to remarks section. Added KSSL characterization to additional data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Additional KSSL characterization available for pedons 78NE151025, 88KS061003s, 88KS061140, 97KS029172, S02KS-029-001, S09KS201001\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
