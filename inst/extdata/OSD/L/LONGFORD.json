  "OVERVIEW": "The Longford series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or reworked loess over reworked residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  Longford soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.   Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Added metric conversions, updated climate, and updated landform positions. Added elevation to typical pedon. Added quad and lat/long to type location. Added clay and sand contents, rock fragments, calcium carbonate equivalent, redox to RIC. Added a BA section to RIC. Added Lasita to competing series. Edited parent material and climate in geographic setting. Updated geographically associated soils (deleted Hastings, Hedville, and Hobbs). Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added redox and lithologic discontinuity to remarks section. Added KSSL characterization to additional data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Additional KSSL characterization available for pedons 78NE151025, 88KS061003s, 88KS061140, 97KS029172, S02KS-029-001, S09KS201001\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
