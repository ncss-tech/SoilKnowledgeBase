  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to Cr horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is from 20 to more than 60 inches.  Angular quartz pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and E horizons horizon and from 0 to 5 percent in the Bt and C horizons.  There are flakes of mica in the Bt and C horizons of most pedons.  The soil is extremely acid or very strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C and Cr horizon colors are variable and commonly contain shades of red, yellow, brown, white and gray.  Some pedons lack a dominant color.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  The Cr horizon is dominantly saprolite from mica schist that can be crushed by the fingers."

The Louisburg, Netcong, and Pinkston soils have coarse-loamy discontinuous argillic horizons.  Manteo soils have a lithic contact at less than 50 inches and have skeletal cambic horizons.  Tallapoosa soils have bedrock at depths of less than 50 inches."
