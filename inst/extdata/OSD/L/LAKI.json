  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for 45 to 70 days in the summer.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Sodium saturation is erratic with depth and the sodium absorption ratio commonly ranges from 10 to 25.  Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from less than 1 to 16 mmhos/cm.  Carbonates commonly are present throughout the soil and range from a trace to about 10 percent.  The soils lack soft, powdery secondary lime within 1 meter of the surface.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is loam or fine sandy loam and averages 18 to 25 percent clay, estimated by 2.5 times 15 bar water values.  Field estimated clay mostly is about 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 1 or 2 dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of neutral, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 0 through 3 dry."

The soils formed in lacustrine sediments weathered from basalt, tuff, diatomite and ash.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 110 days."

Calimus soils also have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches and Fordney soils have a sandy control section.  Henley and Hosley soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches and Hosley soils also have a natric horizon."
