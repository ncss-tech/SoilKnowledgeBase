The Caldwell soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a xeric soil moisture regime.  The Harana soils have 27 to 35 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section and have chroma of 1 moist and dry throughout the profile.  The Jett soils are calcareous in all or in some part of the mollic epipedon.  The Keigley soils have 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate in the particle-size control section.  The Red Rock soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Rustico soils are calcareous in the upper part of the control section and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  The Snow soils have a xeric soil moisture regime."
