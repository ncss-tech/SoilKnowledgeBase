The Jett soils are calcareous in all or in some part of the mollic epipedon.  The Keigley soils have 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate in the particle-size control section.  The Red Rock soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Rustico soils are calcareous in the upper part of the control section and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
