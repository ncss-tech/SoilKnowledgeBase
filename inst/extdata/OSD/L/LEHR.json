    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sandy and gravelly sediments ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The substratum comprises poorly to well-sorted mixtures of calcareous gravel and sand.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is loam, but the range includes gravelly loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or gravelly loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Carbonates are disseminated or in threads or masses.  They are in very thin to medium crusts (1/64 to 1/8 inch thick) on undersides of pebbles.  The Bk horizon is loam containing 2 to 30 percent coarse fragments.  The 2Bk horizon is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sandy loam containing 20 to 45 percent coarse fragments. Some pedons have a 2BCk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sand or it is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand containing 15 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have textures of sand or loamy sand below depths of 40 inches."

Manning soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Parshall soil are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  Wabek soils are on steep ridges and edges of terraces.  They have gravel within 14 inches of the surface and do not have Bw horizons."
