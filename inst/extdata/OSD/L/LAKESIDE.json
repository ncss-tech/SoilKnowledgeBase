  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep and is stratified.  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees to 63 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section (4 to 12 inches) is moist for 120 consecutive days following the winter solstice.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The soil is slightly saline-alkali to moderately saline-alkali.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1; 5Y 5/1, or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2; 5Y 3/1, or 3/2.  It is commonly loam and less commonly clay or clay loam.  Depth to lime ranges from 2 to 6 inches.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/1, or 7/3 and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, or 6/2.  Moist mottles are faint to prominent and have color of 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 4/6, 5/6; 2.5Y 4/4, 6/2; 5Y 3/1 or 3/2.  Mottles with moist chroma of 1 or 2 occur within 30 inches of the surface.  The C horizon is commonly loam or clay loam but thin horizons in some pedons range from sand to clay.  The weighted average clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  Durinodes range from 0 to 15 percent in lower horizons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blucher and Pacheco series in the same family and the Chino, Mocho, and Still series.  Blucher soils are noneffervescent and lack an sa horizon.  Chino soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth.  Mocho soils lack evidence of wetness.  Pacheco soils have more than 2 percent organic matter in the A horizon, have an EC x 1000 of less than 8 mmhos and are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 200 to 240 consecutive days.  Still soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick."

Elevation is 175 to 260 feet.  The climate is arid and has hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 8 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 82 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."

The water table prior to drainage was about 2 to 3 feet.  A perched water table now occurs at a depth of 48 to 72 inches throughout the year.  The soil is wet throughout December through March.  The soil remains moist below 12 inches from April through September."
