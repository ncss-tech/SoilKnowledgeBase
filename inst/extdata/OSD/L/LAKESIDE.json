  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakeside series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Lakeside soils are on basin rims and alluvial plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section (4 to 12 inches) is moist for 120 consecutive days following the winter solstice.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The soil is slightly saline-alkali to moderately saline-alkali.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1; 5Y 5/1, or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2; 5Y 3/1, or 3/2.  It is commonly loam and less commonly clay or clay loam.  Depth to lime ranges from 2 to 6 inches.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/1, or 7/3 and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, or 6/2.  Moist mottles are faint to prominent and have color of 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 4/6, 5/6; 2.5Y 4/4, 6/2; 5Y 3/1 or 3/2.  Mottles with moist chroma of 1 or 2 occur within 30 inches of the surface.  The C horizon is commonly loam or clay loam but thin horizons in some pedons range from sand to clay.  The weighted average clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  Durinodes range from 0 to 15 percent in lower horizons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Chino soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth.  Mocho soils lack evidence of wetness.  Pacheco soils have more than 2 percent organic matter in the A horizon, have an EC x 1000 of less than 8 mmhos and are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 200 to 240 consecutive days.  Still soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick."
