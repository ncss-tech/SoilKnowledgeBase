  "OVERVIEW": "The Ledger series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in saline and sodic alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
