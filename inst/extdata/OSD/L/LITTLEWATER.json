(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nPale Great Group: 7.5YR or redder hues and less than 20% relative clay decrease in the argillic horizon within 150 cm of surface.\nThese soils are located in isolated, steep north facing areas on Ute Mountain and are cooler and have more effective moisture than neutral aspects at the same elevations and precipitation.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
