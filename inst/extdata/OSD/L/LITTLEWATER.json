  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlewater series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from diorite and other intrusive igneous rocks.  Littlewater soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
