    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but\nare dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80\nconsecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean\nannual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F, and the mean\nsummer soil temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  The soil is\nsaturated with water within 40 inches of the surface for 90\ndays during the year where not drained.  The soil is\nnoncalcareous and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe particle-size control section is silt loam to silty clay loam\nand averages 22 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent\ncoarser than fine sand fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20\nto 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 1 or 2\nmoist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1.5 or less.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry,\n3 or 4 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry to a depth of\n20 inches or more and 3 or 4 below this depth.  Mottles are\nprominent or distinct and have chroma of 2 through 8.\nThe 2C horizon is stratified and ranges from sand to loam\nwith rock fragments ranging from 0 to 70 percent.  Some\npedons lack rock fragments to a depth of 60 inches or more."

The soils formed in recent mixed\nalluvium weathered mainly from basaltic, granitic, and\nargillitic bedrock.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160\ndays.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 20 inches.\nThe mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F."
