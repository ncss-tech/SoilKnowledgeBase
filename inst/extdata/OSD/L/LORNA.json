  "OVERVIEW": "The Lorna series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone or mudstone. Lorna soils are on back slopes and foot slopes of structural benches along remnant mesas. Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
