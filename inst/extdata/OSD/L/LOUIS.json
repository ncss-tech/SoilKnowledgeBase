  "OVERVIEW": "The Louis series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified loamy glaciolacustrine deposits on convex rises on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
