  "OVERVIEW": "The Lilsnake series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone.  Lilsnake soils are on plateaus and hillsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
