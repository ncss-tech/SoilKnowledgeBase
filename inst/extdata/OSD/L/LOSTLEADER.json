  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elements (AZ), Romberg (CO), Saemo (AZ), Sed (NV), and Tacan (UT) series. Elements and Saemo soils are very deep and have no visible secondary carbonates. In addition, Elements soils are 15 to 30 centimeters deep to the top of the argillic. Romberg soils are very deep and consist of alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Sed soils are 50 to 100 centimeters deep to bedrock and the lower part of the argillic horizon is dominated by stones. Tacan soils have hues of 2.5YR and 5YR in the argillic horizon, are calcareous below 100 centimeters, and consist of residuum and/or colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, shale, and conglomerate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lostleader soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from quartzite. Elevations are 1950 to 2175 meters (6400 to 7140 feet). The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 305 millimeters (10 to 12 inches); mean annual air temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C. (48 to 52 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 100 to 135 days."
