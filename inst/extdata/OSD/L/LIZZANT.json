  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lizzant series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Lizzant soil are on alluvial fans, hillsides, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches (46 cm) and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F (6.7 degrees C).",
