    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is dry between the depths of 4 and 12 inches less than 45 consecutive days in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. with an O horizon present. The solum has hue of 10YR to 5YR. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter. It is estimated to have greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air-dried). It is weakly or moderately smeary. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section has 15 to 27 percent clay content by field estimate, and averages 35 to 85 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 dry. Texture is a gravelly medial loam or very gravelly medial loam with 12 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 20 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. It has 5 to 12 percent organic matter. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of  3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam, very cobbly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam with 15 to 27 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 20 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones. Reaction is strongly to extremely acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Laderly soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, and back slopes of mountains. Elevations are 1,500 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium weathered from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and warm, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 200 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
