  "REVDATE": "11/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ledru series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in formed in moderately fine and fine textured material derived from mixed igneous rock, mainly from rhyolite and basalt.  These soils are on low rolling hills of typically 10 to 25 percent slope but range from 3 to 30 percent slopes. Mean annual rainfall is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ledru soils are on low rolling hills of typically 10 to 25 percent slope but range from 3 to 30 percent slopes. The topography is commonly hilly and the slopes short and irregular. The area is dissected by numerous arroyos which are usually well covered with grass with little active erosion. These soils formed in moderately fine and fine textured material derived from mixed igneous rock, mainly from rhyolite and basalt. At the type location the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. The mean annual rainfall is about 10 inches most of which falls during the summer."

This soil is not moist long enough to meet the minimum moisture requirement for a mollic epipedon. Classification changed from Argiustolls to Haplargids in 2006."
