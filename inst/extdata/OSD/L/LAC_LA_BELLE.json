  "BYREV": "Rev. KRW-LMC-JJJ",
  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lac La Belle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on ground moraines and end moraines. These soils formed in cobbly and gravelly drift over loamy or sandy till. They are moderately deep to a fragipan. Permeability is rapid above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately rapid below the fragipan. Slope ranges from 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
