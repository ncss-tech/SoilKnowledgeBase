  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches thick.  Lonetree soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  A high percentage of the sand fraction is angular and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizons range from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R."

Ouray soils have moderately coarse textured layers 10 to 24 inches thick in the upper part of the control section, have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, and have small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lonetree soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and small stream bottoms.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 or more percent.  The soil formed in parent materials derived from reddish-brown arkose beds of the Lyons and Fountain formations.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."
