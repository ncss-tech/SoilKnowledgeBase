Crow soils formed in parent material and on landforms associated with glaciers, typically have yellower hues, and are more acidic. Dargol, Fortlewis, Heckly, and Zuni soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Echolake, Lubrecht, Rittel and Valnor soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. In addition, Crow, Fortlewis, Lubrecht and Rittel soils are in LRR-E and are more moist in May and June."

Elevations range from 7,700 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days."
