  "OVERVIEW": "The Ligocki series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and fan alluvium derived from mixed sources. Ligocki soils are on fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
