  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of solum ranges from 30 to 70 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 60 to 80 inches. These soils do not have coarse fragments. The average texture between depths of 10 and 40 inches is fine sand or loamy fine sand. The content of medium sand is less than 5 percent and the content of very fine sand is commonly nearly as much as fine sand. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma are 3 to 5. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in the lower Bw horizons. It is loamy fine sand or fine sand with stratification. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in this horizon. It is stratified fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nA 2C horizon of loamy, glacial till or lacustrine sediments commonly begins at depths ranging from 60 to 80 inches. A bedrock substratum phase is recognized."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane to convex slopes with gradients of 0 to 35 percent. They are on lake plains, outwash plains, valley trains, and terraces. The soils formed in loamy fine sand or fine sand sediments that are stratified. Loamy glacial till or silty or finer lacustrine sediments commonly begin at depths ranging from 60 to 80 inches. These sediments are from the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 124 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,570 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dassel, Fieldon, and Litchfield soils which formed in sediments similar to those of the Lasa soils and are members of the same hydrosequence. The Dassel soils are poorly and very poorly drained and are commonly in swales and depressions. The poorly drained Fieldon soils have carbonates throughout and are on lower lying terrain. The moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Litchfield soils are on lower lying or less sloping terrain."
