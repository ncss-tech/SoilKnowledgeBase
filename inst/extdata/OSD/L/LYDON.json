  "OVERVIEW": "The Lydon series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in weathered tephra over residuum and colluvium from volcanic rocks, predominantly mudflow breccia.  Lydon soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on volcanic ridges in Cascade mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 62 inches, (1575 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F, (12 degrees C).",
