  "OVERVIEW": "The Lebaron series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with an admixture of volcanic ash.  They are on floodplains and drainageways on loess covered basalt plateaus and benches in canyons.  Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the average annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
