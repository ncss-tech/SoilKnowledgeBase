  "OVERVIEW": "The Liart series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in tuffaceous alluvium.  Liart soils are in high mountain valleys and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
