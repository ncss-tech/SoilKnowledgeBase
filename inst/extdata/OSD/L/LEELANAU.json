Mancelona soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Melita soils do not have loamy sand texture in the lower part of the series control section. Southwells soils have an E/B horizon that is more than 41 cm (16 inches) thick."

Leelanau soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."
