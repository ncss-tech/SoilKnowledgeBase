    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 114 centimeters (45 inches) (the Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  13 to 114 centimeters (5 to 45 inches) (the Bt horizons)\nAquic soil conditions/redox features: 23 to 97 centimeters (9 to 38 inches)\nThe Lodgepole soils need to be re-examined for possible inclusion in the \"Vertic\" subgroup.  Lodgepole soils were previously mapped as variants of the Scott series. They are in a drier climate and typically pond for shorter duration than the Scott soils mapped in eastern and central Nebraska. The ponded phase is similar to the Scott soils but the profile classifies the same as Lodgepole. The ponded phase needs additional study to determine if a new series is needed.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nModified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
