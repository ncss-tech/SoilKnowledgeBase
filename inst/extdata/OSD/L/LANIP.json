Brenda, Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario, Hap, Madurez, Mcnew, Mohave, Nutt, Poachie, and Tres Hermanos soils have significant peaks of summer moisture that affect the moisture control section and are not consistent with the moisture distribution of the Mojave Desert. Blackmagic soils have Btky horizons and Btk2 horizons with 30 to 55 percent rock fragments. Jagerson soils are 14 to 24 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and do not have Bk horizons above the argillic. Kidwell soils have non-calcareous argillic horizons and do not have Bk horizons above the argillic."
