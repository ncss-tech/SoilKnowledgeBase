  "OVERVIEW": "The Lotawaca series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite or tuff. Lotawaca soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
