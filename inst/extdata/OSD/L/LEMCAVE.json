    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lemcave soils are on moraines and stream terraces. These soils formed in till and outwash derived from quartzite with local admixtures of granitic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,070 to 2,860 meters. The climate is cool, moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: The revision of March 2003 updates the taxonomic classification from Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Xerorthents, adjusts all horizon depths for the Oi horizon as the soil surface, and verifies the presence of both albic and cambic horizons.\nThe revision of February 2008 updates the classification Sandy-skeletal, mixed, Oxyaqquic Haplocryepts, and modified the horizonation.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOrganic soil material - The zone from the soil surface to about 3 cm (Oi horizon).\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (Oi, A, AE, E1, and E2 horizons).\nCambic Horizon - The zone from 20 to 36 cm (E1 horizon).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from 20 to 76 cm (E1 and E2 horizons).\nLamellae - The zone from 76 to 155 cm (E and Bt horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 28 to 103 cm (lower part of the E1 horizon, E2 and upper part of the E and Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: EWB-RLB-TRM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
