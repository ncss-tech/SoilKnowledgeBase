  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemcave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and outwash derived from quartzite with local admixtures of granitic rocks. Lemcave soils are on moraines and stream terraces. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
