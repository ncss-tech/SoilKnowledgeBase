Elevations range from 1,100 to 2,300 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

Elvedere  soils have a nonsodic argillic horizon.  Peshastin soils have a mollic  epipedon and are loamy-skeletal.  Pogue soils have a mollic epipedon and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Quincy and Winchester soils are sandy.  Skaha soils are sandy-skeletal."
