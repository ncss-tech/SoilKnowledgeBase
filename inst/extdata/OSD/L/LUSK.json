  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments of water worn pebbles in the control section range from 35 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is slightly acid to neutral in the upper part and mildly or moderately alkaline in the lower part. Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy clay, clay, or clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  The coarse fragment content of pebbles ranges from 5 to about 80 percent of any horizon.  Pebbles are mostly quartz, but a few caliche fragments occur in some pedons.  Base saturation is 75 to 100 percent.\nThe Bt portion of the Cr&Bt horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is moderately alkaline.  Texture ranges from gravelly clay to extremely gravelly clay.\nThe Cr horizon is carbonate and silica cemented siliceous gravel.  This horizon is impenetrable to plant roots although it can be dug out with a spade when moist.   A few pedons are underlain by hard conglomerate.  Some pedons are underlain at several feet by beds of loose gravel or sand."

Similar soils are the Acove, Chigley, Hilgrave, Hornsby, Minwells, Pebblepoint, Pedernales, Riesel, Rumple, and Travis series.  Lometa soils are underlain by hard conglomerate that forms a lithic contact.  Acove, Chigley, Minwells, Pedernales, and Travis soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.   Hilgrave and Hornsby soils have less than 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction of the B2t horizon.  Pebblepoint and Riesel soils have sola more than 40 inches thick.  Rumple soils have a mollic epipedon."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 210 to 230 days, and elevation ranges from 1,150 to 1,750 feet. Thornthwaite P-E indices from 34 to 42."

The deep Gageby soils are on low terraces and in bottomlands.   Pitzer soils occur on terraces, lack a Bt horizon, and have a petrocalcic horizon at shallow depth.  The deep Thurber soils are in valleys or on plains."
