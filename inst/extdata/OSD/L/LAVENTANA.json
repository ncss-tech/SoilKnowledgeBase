  "REVDATE": "02/1999",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Laventana series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soil formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite or granite.  Laventana soils are on mountain slopes and pediments. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
