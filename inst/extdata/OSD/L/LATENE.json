  "OVERVIEW": "Latene series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in mixed calcareous alluvium. Latene soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

The soils formed in mixed old calcareous alluvium.  The climate is semiarid to arid continental.  At the type location the annual temperature is about 59 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 8 inches and freeze-free period is 185 days.  Much of the precipitation falls during the summer in heavy thundershowers of short duration.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14."
