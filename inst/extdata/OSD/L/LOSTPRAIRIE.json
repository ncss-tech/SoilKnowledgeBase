  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostprairie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake terraces and alluvial fans.  These soils have a component of volcanic ash in the surface layer and formed in mixed lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",
