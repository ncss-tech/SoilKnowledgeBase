These soils formed in mixed lacustrine sediments with a component of volcanic ash in the surface layer. Elevation is 3,400 to 3,700 feet.  The average annual air temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches, and the average frost-free period is from 70 to 100 days."

Meadowpeak, McLangor, and Barzee soils are on floodplains and closed depressions. Meadowpeak soils are coarse-silty and have an aquic moisture regime. McLangor soils have a histic epipedon. Barzee soils consist of organic materials."
