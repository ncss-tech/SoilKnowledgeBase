  "OVERVIEW": "The La Luna series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in alluvial deposits of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
