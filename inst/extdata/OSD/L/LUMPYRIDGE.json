  "OVERVIEW": "The Lumpyridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Lumpyridge soils are on fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Similar series in the mixed family are the Beartooth(MT), Beeno(WY), Bookcliff(UT), Empedrado(CO), Fairfield(MT), Hangdo(UT), Hoppers(MT), Hyalite(MT), Lininger(CO), Maudlin(CO), Meagher(MT), Moen(CO), Pianohill(MT), Reedwest(MT), Sponsellor(AZ), Trag(CO), Trazuni(NM), Tschicoma(NM), and Ulrant(WY) series.   Beartooth, Empedrado, Fairfield, and Meagher soils have horizons of secondary carbonate.  Beeno, Hoppers, Lininger, and Reedwest soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bookcliff, Tschicoma, and Ulrant soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Hangdo soils are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Hyalite soils have a lithologic discontinuity above 25 inches.  Maudlin, Moen, and Pianohill soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sponsellor soils have a hue of 5YR or redder.  Trag soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Trazuni soils have redoximorphic features at depths of 35 to 50 inches and are dry in the months of May and June."
