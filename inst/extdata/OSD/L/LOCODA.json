The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 55 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth; it is 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has common distinct or prominent mottles to the surface.  It is 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5B, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 0 to 1.  The lower part in some pedons has hue of 5B and 5Y that changes on exposure to air to neutral 5Y or 2.5Y hue.  This horizon is stratified silt loam and silty clay loam, and commonly has 2 to 5 mm thick lenses of decomposed organic materials."
