  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is saturated with water throughout the year and is subject to freshwater overflow during spring floods and high tides unless diked and artificially drained.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 55 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth; it is 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has common distinct or prominent mottles to the surface.  It is 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5B, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 0 to 1.  The lower part in some pedons has hue of 5B and 5Y that changes on exposure to air to neutral 5Y or 2.5Y hue.  This horizon is stratified silt loam and silty clay loam, and commonly has 2 to 5 mm thick lenses of decomposed organic materials."

The soils formed in recent silty alluvium.  They are in a climate with warm moist summers and cool wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches.  Mean July temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F., mean January temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."
