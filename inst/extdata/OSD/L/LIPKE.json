  "OVERVIEW": "The Lipke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or alluvium derived from mudstone or shale. These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
