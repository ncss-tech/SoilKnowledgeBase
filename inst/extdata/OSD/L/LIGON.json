  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "07/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ligon series consists of well drained moderately deep soils to schist bedrock that formed in residuum weathered from schist. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on shoulders, backslopes and summits of ridges and hills underlain by schist bedrock of pre-Cambrian age. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
