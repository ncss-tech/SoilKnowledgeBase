  "OVERVIEW": "The Lundlake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in loamy or silty colluvium and underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till.  These soils are in shallow depressions on moraines.  The permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the upper part and moderately rapid in the underlying glacial till.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is saturated from November to July.  It is moist in all parts during the 90 days following the summer solstice. Depth to free carbonates is from 30 to 74 inches.  The Ap horizons in a few pedons have a small amount of carbonates. The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 60 inches thick.  The control section averages between 20 and 27 percent clay and from 35 to 50 percent sand (30 to 45 percent fine sand and coarser).  Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from about 0 to 6 percent by volume in the A horizons and increase to about 1 to 15 percent in the lower horizons.  Some pedons have an O horizon as much as 6 inches thick.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is loam, sandy loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with less than 30 percent clay.  Some pedons have mucky modifiers.  Some pedons have silt loam subhorizons.  It is commonly neutral but ranges to slightly acid.  Some pedons are slightly alkaline in the upper part.\nA Bg horizon with loam or sandy clay loam textures is present in some pedons.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 2,5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nA 2Bkg horizon may be present.\nThe 2Cg horizon commonly has hue of 5Y or 5GY, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has high chroma mottles.  It is typically fine sandy loam or sandy loam but some pedons have thin subhorizons of loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Coland, Comfrey and Gus soils do not have rock fragments in their series control section.  Delft and Roundual soils are dry in some part of the soil moisture control section during the 90 days following the summer solstice in 6 years out of 10.  Excello soils do not have free carbonates within the series control section.  Glencoe soils have more than 27 percent clay and less than 30 percent sand in the series control section.  James Canyon, Keddie and Kimmerling soils are dry in at least part of the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Nosal soils have more than 27 percent clay in the lower half of the particle size control section.  Romnel soils have appreciable gypsum in the series control section.  Wenas soils have sandy textures in the lower one third of the series control section."

They formed in loamy or silty colluvium and underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till of the Wadena lobe of the late Wisconsin glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 28 inches.  The number of frost free days ranges from 140 to 155 days.

Somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained Grovecity soils and the somewhat poorly drained Marcellon soils are on summits.  Poorly drained Forestcity soils are on footslopes.  Poorly drained Crowriver soils are highly calcareous and on rims of depressions.  Poorly drained Swedegrove and Uniongrove are nearby on level higher landscape positions.  Swedegrove is calcareous throughout."
