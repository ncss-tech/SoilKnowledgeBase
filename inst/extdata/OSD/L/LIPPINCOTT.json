  "OVERVIEW": "The Lippincott series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. They formed in outwash dominantly of limestone origin on outwash plains and terraces. In some places, the upper part of the solum formed in silty or loamy alluvium or in loess as much as 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Kane soils and the well drained Warsaw soils have loose sand and gravel within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and are nearby. Ockley, Sleeth, Thackery, and Westland soils formed in similar materials but are fine-loamy.

The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the substratum."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Lippincott soils were formerly classified in the clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal family. Some field studies and data indicate that the Lippincott soils do not have a contrasting particle-size control section. Further investigation is needed during MLRA updating activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to 41 cm (Ap, A, Bt horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 69 cm (Bt, Btg horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and in all underlying horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for CH-32, CH-36 (the typical pedon), and DK-27 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
