    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to sandy substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an E horizon. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  It has strong fine to coarse columnar or prismatic structure.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or less. It is loam or sandy loam. It has a CaCO3 equivalent of more than 15 percent. Some pedons have Bkz, Bz or BC horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is coarse sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. In some pedons the 2C horizon is stratified and cross-bedded with fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand. It contains as much as 20 percent gravel. Some pedons do not have 2C or 3C horizons, and have a fine sandy loam C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lemert soils are on level to moderately sloping outwash and lake plains. Slopes gradients range from 0 to 9 percent. The soils formed in moderately coarse textured over coarse textured sediments. The climate is cool and subhumid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 degrees to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 16 to 22 inches. Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Binford, Brantford, Embden, Fordville, Letcher, Renshaw, Stirum and Totten series.  Brantford, Binford, Embden, Fordville and Renshaw soils do not have natric horizons, are on nearby outwash plains and are on higher lying and better drained areas.  Letcher soils commonly are in complex with Lemert soils and are in the slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Letcher soils do not have visible gypsum or salt crystals within depths of 16 inches.  Stirum and Totten soils are on lower areas of outwash plains.  These soils have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Totten soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal."

Permeability is slow in the Bt horizon and moderately rapid or rapid in the 2C horizon. The somewhat poorly drained phase has a water table within depths of 3 to 5 feet for a short time in the spring and during long wet seasons."
