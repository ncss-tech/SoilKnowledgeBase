Golondrina, Majada, Montoso, Murdo, Nederland, Purcella, Romine, and Willoman soils are very deep. Montoso soils have strongly contrasting layers of cinders between 12 and 32 inches (The concept of Montoso should be reexamined and possibly reclassified as Loamy over pumiceous or cindery). Murdo soils have sola 10 to 20 inches thick over horizons of strongly contrasting sands and gravel (The concept of Murdo should be reexamined and possibly reclassified as Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal). Irock, Mokiak, and Salas soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact of gneiss or schist bedrock. Jumbopeak soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of gneiss and schist. Wandurn soils are deep to a lithic contact of monzonite. Wheelerwell soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact of dolomite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ligai soils are on backslopes of mountains.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary quartz diorite and sandstone.  Slopes are 35 to 70 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high- intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Pastorpeak soils are very deep, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent north-facing backslopes.  Zibetod soils are shallow, have mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes and shoulders of domes."
