  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lasac soils are on volcanic plateaus, escarpments of plateaus, and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent and vary from rolling to very steep and convex. The soil formed in a thin mantle of mixed loess and tephra over tephra. The rock fragments and sand sized fractiona are dominantly obsidian. Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 30 to 37 degrees F. Frost may occur at anytime throughout the year. Frost-free season is 0 to 30 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the proposed Castan (T), Dashiki (T) and Oleo (T) series. Castan soils occur intermixed with the Lasac soils on plateau escarpments. They have umbric epipedons and are greater than 60 inches deep to substratum layers of tephra. Dashiki and Oleo soils occur intermixed with the Lasac soils on plateaus. Dashiki soils are moderately deep to substratum layers of tephra. Oleo soils have umbric epipedons and argillic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS: This draft reflects a change in classification fron Ashy-skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Cryochrepts to Ashy-skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Dystrocryepts. This change is based on Soil Taxonomy 2nd Ed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 7 inches (the A horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 11 inches (the Bw horizon).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 41 inches (the 2BC, 2C1 and part of the 2C2 horizon).\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 1 to 11 inches (the A and Bw horizons).\nMoisture regime - udic.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sample submitted to the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for analysis of andic soil properties. Client assigned lab No. S92ID-043-129. Project file number: 93P-52. Lab assigned number: 93P314. Sample: 93P 2486-2487.\n3/27/08 - In review of this description and corresponding lab analysis, further investigation is needed to determine the thickness of the cambic horizon and for determining base saturation (for the depth between 25 to 75 cm below the mineral soil surface) to classify as Dystrocryepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
