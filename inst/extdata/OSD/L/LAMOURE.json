  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamoure series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. The control section typically is a silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to more than 60 inches.  Buried A horizons are common below depths of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 6 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Chroma of 2 is only in the lower part.  Redox features are variable, ranging from few fine faint to many prominent.  In some pedons the Cg horizon contains few or common, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  The Cg horizon below depths of 40 inches has texture similar to the control section or is stratified loam, silt loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Some pedons are sand, gravelly sand, or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Halleck soils have mean annual precipitation of 10 to 12 inches and violent effervescence throughout.  Inkom soils have cambic horizons.  Playmoor soils contain more visible salts and have more exchangeable sodium.  Rauville soils do not have mottles within depths of 40 inches and are very poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are less than 2 percent.  They formed in silty alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 135 days; average growing season precipitation from 14 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3100."

Ludden and Playmoor soils are in similar landscapes.  Ludden soils have a fine textured series control section.  Rauville soils are in more depressed and sluggish drainageways.  Dovray soils are deeper to carbonates, have a fine textured series control section, and are on similar landscapes.  The well drained Forman soils have an argillic horizon and on adjacent uplands.  The moderately well drained LaDelle soils do not have mottles within depths of 40 inches and are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Lowe soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface and have a fine-loamy series control section.  They are on similar landscapes to the Lamoure soil.  The well drained Poinsett soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick and are on adjacent uplands."
