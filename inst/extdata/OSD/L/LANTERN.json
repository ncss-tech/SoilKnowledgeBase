These soils formed in material derived from gneiss and micaceous schist.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters and moist springs.  Mean annual preciptation is 25 to 40 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
