Depth to a lithic contact of unweathered bedrock (R) is more than 60 inches. Silt content is more than 40 percent and generally more than 50 percent in the upper part of the solum. Rock fragments of quartz or slate range from 0 to 25 percent in the A and E horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the BE, B, and BC horizons, and 0 to 50 percent in the C horizon with more than 30 percent restricted to the lower part of the C horizon. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. Hue of 2.5Y is restricted to thin individual subhorizons. Iron or clay depletions and accumulations in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red are present in most pedons. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Iron or clay accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, and red are present in most pedons. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. Iron or clay depletions and accumulations in shades of gray, white, yellow, brown, and red are present in most pedons. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BCg or CBg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 0 or 2. Iron or clay accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, and red are present in most pedons. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon colors are variable and commonly do not have a dominant color. Iron depletions and accumulations in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red may be present. Texture is very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, and red may be present. Texture is very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, moderately hard, and slightly to moderately fractured argillite or other fine grained metavolcanic rock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annemaine, Bush River, Cid, Creedmoor, Dogue, Gritney, Helena, Mandale (T), Prosperity, and Wolftever series in the same family. Annemaine soils formed in stratified clayey and loamy sediments on marine or stream terraces in the coastal plain and have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches. Bush River, Helena, and Prosperity soils formed in residuum from mixed felsic, intermediate, or mafic igneous high-grade rocks. Cid soils have a depth to paralithic contact of 20 to 40 inches. Creedmoor soils formed in Triassic Basin sediments and have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches. Dogue and Wolftever soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches and are located on low stream terraces. Gritney soils formed in coastal plain sediments and have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches. Mandale (T) soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lignum soils are in depressions and on undulating uplands, in interstream divides, and around the heads of drainageways. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 6 percent with a range of 0 to 15 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from argillite or other fine grained metavolcanic rocks. The mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Alamance, Badin, Georgeville, Goldston, Gundy, Herndon, Montonia, Nanford and Tarrus soils are well drained. Kirksey soils have a fine-silty particle size control section and a depth to hard bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Misenheimer and Goldston soils are loamy and less than 20 inches to a paralithic contact. Secrest soils have a fine-silty particle size control section and a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches."
