  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly sediments. Lawler soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces on flood-plain steps and on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
