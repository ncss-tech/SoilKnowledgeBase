Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2.5 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.   Content of rock fragments range from 50 to 80 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bkm horizon is composed of indurated petrocalcic horizon and has hue of 10YR, value of 8, and chroma 3.  It cannot be excavated with hand tools, but is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.
