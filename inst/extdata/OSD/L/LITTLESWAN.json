  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Littleswan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
