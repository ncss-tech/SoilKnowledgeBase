  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemoore series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Lemoore soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",
