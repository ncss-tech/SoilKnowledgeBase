The organic matter is less than 1 percent at the surface and decreases regularly with increasing depth.  The soil is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent below a depth of 7 inches.  The SAR is 2 to 13 in the upper part and of the profile increases with increasing depth to 15 to 200 in the lower part.  Salinity is less than 2 mmhos in the surface and less than 4 in the lower part of the profile and commonly increases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; or 10YR 6/3 and moist color of 2.5Y 4/2; or 10YR 3/2.  It commonly is sandy loam and less commonly fine sandy loam.  This horizon has weak medium subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has moist color of 2.5YR 3/2, 4/2, or 5/2.  Mottles are few to many, fine or medium, faint to prominent and have moist color of 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 3/4 or 4/4.  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is strongly alkaline."
