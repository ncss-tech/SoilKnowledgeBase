These soils are dry in all parts above the lithic contact more than half of the time that the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 44 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and a chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is very gravelly or gravelly clay loam, very cobbly or cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay.  The Bt2 is gravelly clay loam, clay loam or gravelly clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is extremely gravelly clay, very cobbly clay or very gravelly clay."

These soils formed in residuum weathered from basalt and slope alluvium with additions of loess.  Elevations are 1,200 to 2,000 feet.  These soils are in an arid climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches.  Average January  temperature is about 29 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 71 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 135 to 195 days."
