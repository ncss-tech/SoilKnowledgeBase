  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Levnik series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basalt and slope alluvium with additions of loess on hillslopes and dissected plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in all parts above the lithic contact more than half of the time that the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 44 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and a chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is very gravelly or gravelly clay loam, very cobbly or cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay.  The Bt2 is gravelly clay loam, clay loam or gravelly clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is extremely gravelly clay, very cobbly clay or very gravelly clay."
