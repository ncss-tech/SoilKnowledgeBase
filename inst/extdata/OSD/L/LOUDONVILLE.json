  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The content of rock fragments (including some glacial erratics) is 0 to 5 percent in the Ap or A horizon, 2 to 25 percent in the Bt horizon, and 10 to 60 percent in 2BC and 2C horizons. The minimum depth to a horizon with more than 35 percent rock fragments, if present, is 20 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated areas have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is loam or silt loam. It is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nIn most cultivated areas the E horizon is mixed in the Ap, but some pedons have an E horizon up to 4 inches thick. Undisturbed areas have an E horizon 1 to 7 inches thick. The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles are present in the lower few inches of the argillic horizon in some pedons. The Bt is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; or their channery analogues. It has weak to strong medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It is medium acid to very strongly acid. The BC or 2BC horizon has colors similar to those of the Bt horizon. It is sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, silt loam, or silty clay loam; or their channery or very channery analogues. It is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a C or 2C horizon up to 15 inches thick that has similar ranges as the BC or 2BC horizon."

Burkittsville (T) does not have an OSD on file to compare. Culleoka, Frondorf, and Oatlands soils do not have glacial erratics in the rock fragment fraction. Alanthus, Athol, Door, Duffield, Dumfries, Ebbing, Grayford, Hayter, Lamotte, Legore, Manassas, Mechanicsburg, Middleburg, Morrison, Myersville, Panorama, Pasturerock, Sowego, Sudley, Westmoreland, Wheeling, and Williamsburg soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Cateache, Kell, and Spriggs soils have a paralithic rather than lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.\nPrior competing series that have not been assigned a cation-exchange activity class are the Bolton, Bookwood, and Washington series. Bolton and Washington soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Bookwood soils have a paralithic contact rather than a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loudonville soils are nearly level to very steep and are formed in till which is moderately deep over sandstone or siltstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Loudonville soils formed in medium textured glacial till of Wisconsinan or Illinoian age although the lower part of some pedons may be derived from or influenced by the underlying rock. A thin (less than 14 inches) loess mantle is present in some areas. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F."

Canfield, Rittman, and Wooster soils which have fragipan horizons are adjacent where Wisconsinan till deposits are more than 40 inches thick. Chagrin, Holly, Lobdell, and Orrville soils are on nearby flood plains. Chili, Conotton, and Wheeling soils which do not have a lithic contact are on adjacent glacial outwash and terraces. Hanover and Titusville soils which have fragipan horizons are adjacent where Illinoian till is more than 40 inches thick."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas on slopes less than 18 percent are cleared and used for cultivated crops. Corn, small grains, and mixed hay are principal crops. Some areas are pastured. Orchards are common, especially in areas within a few miles of Lake Erie. Many areas are in nonagricultural uses. Native vegetation is hardwood forest, dominantly oak and hickory with lesser amounts of hard maple and ash."
