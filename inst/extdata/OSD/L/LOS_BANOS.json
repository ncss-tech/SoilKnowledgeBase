  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Haplargids with mixed clay mineralogy and as Haploxeralfs. Presence of carbonates was determined by 10 percent HCl. Calcium carbonate equivalent was determined by HCl and syringe field kit. Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nSoils mapped in San Benito County with slopes greater than 15 percent are excluded from the series concept. Geomorphically, the taxonomic unit is unlikely to occur at both 0 percent slopes and 50 percent slopes. Soils with slope greater than 15 percent will be correlated to either taxadjuncts or a new series. The mean annual precipitation range in characteristics was not expanded to accommodate the 5 to 8 inches of mean annual precipitation that the San Benito County Soil Survey uses. This climatic data is questionable and it is estimated that all areas where Los Banos series is mapped in San Benito County have more than 8 inches mean annual precipitation.\nIn the conversion from SCS-5 and MUIR data to NASIS on the Merced County, Western Part, California Soil Survey, several of the calcium carbonate percents were not entered correctly. The correct percentages should be entered in NASIS as follows: A horizon - 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate; BA, Btk horizons - 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate; C horizon - 1 to 25 percent calcium carbonate."
