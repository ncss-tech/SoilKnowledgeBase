  "OVERVIEW": "The Lunchcreek series consists of deep and very deep to hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on mountain slopes and headwalls. Slopes are 50 to 100 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 170 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic soil moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is 40 to greater than 60 inches. The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to 40 inches has andic soil properties throughout, and 15 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume, however the weighted average volume of rock fragments is over 35 percent. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air dried samples and acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.5 percent.
