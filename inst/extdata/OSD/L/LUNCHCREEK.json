The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic soil moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is 40 to greater than 60 inches. The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to 40 inches has andic soil properties throughout, and 15 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume, however the weighted average volume of rock fragments is over 35 percent. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air dried samples and acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.5 percent. It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum. The particle-size control section has 10 to 25 percent field estimated clay and 10 to 35 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and dry. It is gravelly medial silt loam, very gravelly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or very gravelly medial silt loam. It has weak or moderate structure. It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter to a depth of 40 inches and decreases to 1 to 10 percent below 40 inches."
