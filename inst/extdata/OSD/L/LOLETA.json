    "content": "REMARKS: Loleta series was originally classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Humaquolls.  Reclassified as fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Fluvaqentic Endoaquolls is based on changes in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, ninth edition, and temperature data recorded in the survey area 2001 through 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 36 centimeters.\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 36 to 81 centimeters.\n3. Aquic Conditions - the zone from 10 to 173 centimeters.\n4. Fluvaquentic feature: an irregular decrease in organic carbon from a  depth of 25 centimeters to 125 centimeters below the mineral soil surface.\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (Bg1 and Bg2) averages 22 percent clay, and 28 percent fine sand or coarser."
