Russ soils have redoximorphic features at depths greater than 100 centimeters (40 inches), are coarse-loamy, and on natural levees. Weott soils are have redoximorphic features at 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches), are fine-silty, and are on backswamps, depressions, and low flood-plain steps."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Loleta series was originally classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Humaquolls.  Reclassified as fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Fluvaqentic Endoaquolls is based on changes in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, ninth edition, and temperature data recorded in the survey area 2001 through 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 36 centimeters.\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 36 to 81 centimeters.\n3. Aquic Conditions - the zone from 10 to 173 centimeters.\n4. Fluvaquentic feature: an irregular decrease in organic carbon from a  depth of 25 centimeters to 125 centimeters below the mineral soil surface.\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (Bg1 and Bg2) averages 22 percent clay, and 28 percent fine sand or coarser.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of California sample 62-CA-12-003 was collected from the 1964 type location (Soils of Western Humboldt County 1965) which occurs in the same area and on a similar landform. Reference samples from pedon number S02CA600-006 from the new site was analyzed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory. Reference samples from pedon numbers S02CA600-007 through 012, 020, and 021 occur in the same area and in similar landforms. Full pedons from numbers S02CA600-015, 17, 21 analyzed by National Soil Survey Laboratory and occur in the same area.\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 88CA600002\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
