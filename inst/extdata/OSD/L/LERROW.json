  "OVERVIEW": "The Lerrow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks. Lerrow soils are on hills, mountains, and rock pediments. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C.",
