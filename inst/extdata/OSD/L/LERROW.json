  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lerrow soils are on hills, mountains, and rock pediments. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, or rhyolite, sedimentary rocks such as shale or chert, or metamorphic rocks such as quartzite. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,500 meters to 2,270 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5.5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
