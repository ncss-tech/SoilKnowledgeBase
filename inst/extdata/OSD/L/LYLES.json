  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 40 to 60 inches. Depth to textures of loamy sand and sand is greater than 40 inches. The solum contains 0 to 3 percent fine gravel. The thickness of mollic epipedon typically is l0 to 24 inches. The series control section contains 50 percent or more fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam. Above a depth of 40 inches the layers of sandy clay loam and loam are 5 inches thick or less and contain up to 22 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BCg horizon is similar to the Bg horizon in color and typically has similar textures but in some pedons includes loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand or sand, and some pedons have strata of silt loam, loam, or sandy loam, that contain 50 percent or more fine sand or coarser. Reaction is neutral or slighty alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corunna, Darfur, Dassel, Gilford, Hanska, Jubilee, Overshue, Toolesboro, Uniongrove and Zadog soils. Corunna soils have silty clay loam horizons above a depth of 40 inches. Darfur, Dassel, and Hanska soils are in an area with 26 to 30 inches of mean annual precipitation, have cooler temperatures, commonly have yellower hues, and are less than 40 inches to the sandy substratum. In addition, Darfur soils have solums in which 85 percent or more of the sand fraction is fine or very fine sand. Gilford soils are in a climate belt of 30 to 36 inches of mean annual precipitation and have loamy sand or sand at a depth of less than 40 inches. Jubilee soils have cooler temperature, shorter frost free season, and mean annual precipitation of less than 15 inches, and contain few to many mica flakes. In additon, Jubilee soils have 2C horizons within a depth of 40 inches that are stratified coarse sand to sandy loam and do not have Bg horizons with prismatic structure. Overshue soils  have soil temperatures of less than 50 degrees F. and have more than 10 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Toolesboro soils do not have stratification in the lower part of the solum and have hue of 7.5YR or redder. Uniongrove soils have subhorizons in the lower part of the series control section that have less than 50 percent fine sand and coarser. Zadog soils have cemented iron accumulations in the subsoil."

The soils formed in sandy and loamy stratified outwash material of mixed origin. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches,  mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F., frost free period ranges from 170 to 210 days and elevation ranges from 360 to 600 feet above mean sea level."

The well drained Alvin soils are on higher lying areas on nearly level to steep slopes. Ayrshire soils are nearly level, somewhat poorly drained, and have an argillic horizon. Bloomfield soils have a banded argillic horizon, are well drained, and are on higher lying areas. Bobtown soils are moderately well drained and are on higher lying areas. Princeton soils are well drained soils on nearly level to moderately steep slopes."
