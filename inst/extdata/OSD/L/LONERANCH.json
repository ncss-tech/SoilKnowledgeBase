  "OVERVIEW": "The Loneranch series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from highly sheared and weathered metasedimentary rock.  Loneranch soils occur in open grassland areas on broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.   Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 30 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 35 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has 15 to 40 percent rock fragments with the weighted average being less than 35 percent.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes part of the Bw horizon.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is gravelly medial clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Moist bulk density is 0.9 to 1.0 g/cc.  Organic matter is 7 to 10 percent.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has color similar to the A horizon.  It is gravelly medial clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Moist bulk density is 0.9 to 1.0 g/cc.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Common fine distinct redox depletions with chroma of 2 occur below 20 inches.  It has 30 to 35 percent clay.  The Bw1 and Bw2 horizons have 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The Bw3 horizon is gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles."

The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."

Reedsport soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, well drained, and are on ridgetops and side slopes.  Reinhart soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact and are in grassland areas on ridgetops and side slopes.  Sebastian soils are loamy-skeletal, 10 to 20 inches deep, have serpentinitic mineralogy, and are on ridgetops and side slopes.
