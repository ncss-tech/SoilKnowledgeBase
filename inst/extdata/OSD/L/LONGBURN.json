  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Longburn series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium, and reworked eolian material derived from sandstone.  Longburn soils are in canyons and on mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
