Fragments of shale and sandstone range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the profile, but pedons with up to 80 percent shale fragments in the Cd horizon do occur.\nThe Ad horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is a fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam and silty clay loam.  It is mottled in shades of red, brown and gray.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 0.  The upper part is slightly weathered and the lower part is hard."

Soils in similar families are the Kanima series and the tentative Cartersville, Emachaya, Whitefield and Ironbridge series.  Kanima soils have more coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Cartersville soils are less clayey and do not have Cd horizons.  Blocker soils have less than 10 inches of reclaim material over the shale.  Hoyt and Whitefield soils have depths of reclaim material over shale that are greater than 20 inches."

The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 45 inches."

Hoyt and Whitefield soils are on generally less sloping areas and have Cd horizons that are deeper over shale material.  Kanima soils are on adjacent non-reclaimed areas."
