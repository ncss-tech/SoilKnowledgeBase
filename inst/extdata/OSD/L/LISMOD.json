These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

Lisbon was assigned moderately slow permeability. The Lismod series will be used in those areas which have a moderate permeability class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches) (Ap and AB horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 38 to 99 cm (15 to 39 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); discontinuity at 89 cm (35 inches) - the contact between the Bt4 and 2Bt5 horizons."
