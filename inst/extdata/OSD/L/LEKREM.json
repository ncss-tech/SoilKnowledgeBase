    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence (A and Bw horizons) is 12 to 25 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A  horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 3 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, and 2 to 6 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or very cobbly coarse sandy loam.  It has 25 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 2 to 6 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or very stony sandy loam, below 40 inches it can range to very gravelly loamy coarse sand or very gravelly loamy sand.  It has 20 to 45 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones."

Brevco, Redpeak, Santop and Thout soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Coxit soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Highhorn soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Huntrock soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Jimbluff soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Longort soils have a Cd horizon and 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Ontrail soils have redder hues.  Jumpe soils have loam and silt loam fine-earth textures in the solum and have 15 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Seeburg soils have vitrandic properties in a zone 7 to 14 inches thick.  Radarcreek soils are similar but have developed in sedimentary and volcanic rock parent material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lekrem soils are on back slopes of mountains usually with southerly aspects.  Elevation ranges from 2,400 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and glacial till from granitic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
