    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The solum is underlain by saprolite. Depth to bedrock, both hard and weathered, is more than 5 feet. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout, but individual subhorizons range up to 60 percent. Rock fragments consist of gravel, cobbles, stones and boulders. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Flakes of mica range from none to common in all horizons.\nThe A horizon is has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles range from none to common and are in shades of red, brown, and yellow. Texture is dominantly sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons may have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe BC, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bt, but may include loamy sand.\nThe C horizon is highly weathered saprolite from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is weathered felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe R horizon, where present, is hard felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Louisburg soils were formerly classified in the Lithosol great soil group. The July 1975 revision changed the series from a moderately deep Typic Dystrochrept to a very deep Ruptic Ultic Dystrochrept with variable depth to lithic or paralithic contact. The purpose was to describe a complex of Dytrochrepts and Hapludults. The series was little used after the 1975 revision as the Ashlar, Wateree and Rion soils were used for these complexes. This revision restores part of the concept of the Louisburg series for the very deep component that occurs in many or most of these map units.  05/07 BC added to RIC. RHB\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 26 inches below the surface (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nMLRA=136\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSOI-5 Soil Name  Slope Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip Elevation\nGA0038 LOUISBURG 2- 50 60- 65  210-240   45- 52 500- 800\nGA0059 LOUISBURG 6- 50 60- 65  210-240   45- 52 500- 800\nGA0086 LOUISBURG 2- 50 60- 65  210-240   45- 52 500- 800\nSOI-5 FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind Months Bedrock Hardness\nGA0038 NONE      \t6.0-6.0 \t    - \t    40-40 \tHARD\nGA0059 NONE \t\t6.0-6.0 \t    -      40-40 \tHARD\nGA0086 NONE \t\t6.0-6.0 \t    -      40-40 \tHARD\nSOI-5 \tDepth \tTexture \t\t\t3-Inch No-10  Clay% -CEC-\nGA0038 0- 7 \tLS LCOS \t\t\t0- 15  70- 98 2-12    -\nGA0038 0- 7  SL FSL  \t\t\t0- 15  75- 95 5-15    -\nGA0038 7-24  SL      \t\t\t0- 15  75- 98 7-18    -\nGA0038 24-60 WB       - - - -\nGA0059 0- 7  ST-SL ST-LS ST-LCOS \t\t25- 38 70- 83 2-15    -\nGA0059 0- 7  STV-SL \t\t\t35- 50 70- 83 2-15    -\nGA0059 7-24  ST-SL \t\t\t\t25- 38 75- 83 7-18    -\nGA0059 24-60 WB - - - -\nGA0086 0- 7  GR-LS GR-LCOS \t\t0- 15  50- 75 2-12    -\nGA0086 0- 7  GR-SL GR-FSL GR-COSL \t0- 15  50- 75 5-15    -\nGA0086 7-24  SL GR-SL GR-COSL \t\t0- 15  60- 90 7-18    -\nGA0086 24-60 WB - - - -\nSOI-5  Depth   -pH-    O.M.
