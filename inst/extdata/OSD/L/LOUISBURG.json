  "OVERVIEW": "The Louisburg Series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss. The Louisburg soils are on summits and side slopes of the Piedmont uplands. Slope ranges from 6 to 45 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 45 inches.",

It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles range from none to common and are in shades of red, brown, and yellow. Texture is dominantly sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons may have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe BC, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bt, but may include loamy sand.\nThe C horizon is highly weathered saprolite from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is weathered felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe R horizon, where present, is hard felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Louisburg soils were formerly classified in the Lithosol great soil group. The July 1975 revision changed the series from a moderately deep Typic Dystrochrept to a very deep Ruptic Ultic Dystrochrept with variable depth to lithic or paralithic contact. The purpose was to describe a complex of Dytrochrepts and Hapludults. The series was little used after the 1975 revision as the Ashlar, Wateree and Rion soils were used for these complexes. This revision restores part of the concept of the Louisburg series for the very deep component that occurs in many or most of these map units.  05/07 BC added to RIC. RHB\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 26 inches below the surface (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nMLRA=136"
