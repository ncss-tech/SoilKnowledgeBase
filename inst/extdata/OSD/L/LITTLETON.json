  "OVERVIEW": "The Littleton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on alluvial fans, toe slopes of uplands, and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium.  Mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).",

Raddle soils have a mollic epipedon less than 61 cm (24 inches) in thickness.  The poorly drained Sawmill soils are on flood plains below Littleton soils.  They are mottled in the mollic epipedon."
