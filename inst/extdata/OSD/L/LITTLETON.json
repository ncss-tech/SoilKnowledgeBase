Slope gradients commonly are 2 percent or less, but range to as steep as 5 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 13.3 degrees C (46 to 56 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches), frost free period ranges from 150 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 415 meters (340 to 1360 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Coffeen soils are on similar or slightly lower parts of the landscape.  The moderately well drained and well drained Huntsville and somewhat poorly drained Lawson soils are on the flood plains below Littleton soils or, in some places, on narrow flood plains upstream from alluvial fans.  The moderately well drained and well drained Worthen and Raddle soils are typically on higher or more steeply sloping parts of similar landscape positions.  Raddle soils have a mollic epipedon less than 61 cm (24 inches) in thickness.  The poorly drained Sawmill soils are on flood plains below Littleton soils.  They are mottled in the mollic epipedon."
