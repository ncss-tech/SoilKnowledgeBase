  "OVERVIEW": "The Longbell series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in tephra deposited over volcanic outwash. These soils are on lava plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
