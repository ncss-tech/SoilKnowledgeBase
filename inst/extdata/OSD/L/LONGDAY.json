  "OVERVIEW": "The Longday series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, andesite, tuff-breccia, or metavolcanic rock.  Longday soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 36 to 100 cm.  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Pequop soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizons with less than 60 percent rock fragments and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.
