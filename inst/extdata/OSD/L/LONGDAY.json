Devaul soils are deep to paralithic contacts. Glideski soils a C horizon with 6 to 18 percent clay. Heechee, Holmes, and Howcan soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 100 cm.  Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 36 to 100 cm.  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Pequop soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizons with less than 60 percent rock fragments and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Wambolt soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments which are mainly quartzite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longday soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite, tuff, tuff-breccia, and metavolcanic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,440 to 3,150 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 760 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 4 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
