  "OVERVIEW": "The Lismore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty sediments over glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately slow in the glacial till.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 23 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate typically is greater than 20 inches, but some pedons have calcareous spots at shallower depths due to worm activity.  The thickness of the silty surface layer ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Most pedons have slight or moderate worm activity in the solum.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 20 to 25 inches, but ranges from 16 to 30 inches or more and extends into the 2Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of less than 1.5.  It has a chroma of 2 in the lower part of some pedons.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam containing less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon similar in texture to the A horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or less.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam and is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has color of the C horizon.  It is clay loam or loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has common or many, faint through prominent mottles."

Aastad, Darnen, Delette, Lankin, and Svea soils contain more fine sand or coarser in the upper part of the sola.  In addition, Darnen and Delette soils formed in alluvial-colluvial sediments and Lankin soils formed in lacustrine sediments over glacial till.  Walsh soils formed in alluvium derived from shale or glacial till containing a high amount of shale.  Athelwold soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Beotia, Brookings, Overly, Tara, and Waubay are fine-silty.  Fordville, Spottswood, and Vang soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Vienna soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick."
