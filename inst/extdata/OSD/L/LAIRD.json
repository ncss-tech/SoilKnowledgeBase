Some soils in this setting may have had a water table with a capillary fringe reaching the surface as evidenced by carbonates at the surface and the presence of saltgrass and some rushes.  It appears that the apparent water tables have receded because of change in climate, drainage, or extensive use of ground water for irrigation.\nLast updated by the state 10/91.\nModified format by LRM in 1/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
