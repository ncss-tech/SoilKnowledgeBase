  "OVERVIEW": "The Laird series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in wind reworked sand over marly deposits containing fossilized shells and in calcareous loamy lacustrine sediments.  Laird soils are in swales of sandhill valleys and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) at the type location.",

Some soils in this setting may have had a water table with a capillary fringe reaching the surface as evidenced by carbonates at the surface and the presence of saltgrass and some rushes.  It appears that the apparent water tables have receded because of change in climate, drainage, or extensive use of ground water for irrigation.\nLast updated by the state 10/91.\nModified format by LRM in 1/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
