  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavodnas series consists of shallow, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in local alluvium and slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous shale on hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
