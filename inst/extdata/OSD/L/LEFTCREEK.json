These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of  the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. The solum  has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples and averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is ashy sandy loam or ashy coarse sandy loam, and it is very gravelly or very cobbly. It has 20 to 50 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

Elevation ranges from 1,400 to 4,800 feet. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. They form in volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The average January temperature ranges from 25 to 30 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F, and average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 140 days."
