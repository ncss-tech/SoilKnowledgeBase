  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakoa series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale on uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
