  "OVERVIEW": "The Lebam series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material from deeply weathered siltstone or very fine sandstone. Lebam soils are on mountains and have slopes of 1 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Andic soil properties extend from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 15 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon and AB horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Texture is medial silt loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent paragravel. It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter. It has moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 2 to 4 percent, and phosphate retention of 85 to 100. Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry. It is silty clay loam or silty clay and has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent pararock fragments. In some pedons below a depth of 40 inches, texture may include clay loam and up to 60 percent pararock fragments. The Bw horizon has a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.20 g/cc, 2 to 7 percent organic matter and 35 to 55 percent field estimated clay."

In Oregon, these soils are on ridgetops and side slopes with slopes ranging to 90 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from siltstone, very fine sandstone and tuffaceous sedimentary bedrock. They occur in a coastal marine climate with cool wet winters and cool dry summers. The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 110 inches. The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
