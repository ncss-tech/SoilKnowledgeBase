  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lawet soils are level or nearly level.  They are on flood plains and commonly at the upper end of stream valleys in sand-loess transition areas.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.   Lawet soils formed in loamy alluvium.  The range of mean annual air temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C (47 degrees to 52 degrees F) and the range of mean annual precipitation is 460 t0 760 millimeters (18 to 30 inches)."

The Coleridge, Gibbon, Lamo, Lex, and Ord soils do not have calcic horizons and are somewhat poorly drained.  The Coleridge, Gibbon, and Lamo soils are in the fine-silty family.  Lex soils are moderately deep over coarse sand or gravelly sand.  Ord soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  Orwet soils are in the sandy family."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Lawet soils are mostly in meadow and pasture.  Native vegetation, when in excellent condition, is mainly big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, and prairie cordgrass. Small areas are used as cropland, but in many areas, adequate drainage is difficult to provide. See Remarks section for native vegetative cover in Nebraska."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Lawet soils were previously mapped in the Gibbon, Lamo, and Leshara series.  A somewhat poorly drained phase has been mapped and will need future investigations for possible new series. Phases recognized to date include drained, wet, ponded, and saline-alkali.\nOSD modification RRZ 7/2002: Within 38 centimeters (15 inches) of the soil surface the calcium carbonate equivalent may be as low as 12 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 46 centimeters (18 inches) (Ak and ABk horizons)\ncalcic horizon--the zone from surface of the soil to about 140 centimeters (55 inches) (Ak, ABk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).\nIn Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with sedges (Carex emoryi, C. laeviconica, C. pellita, C. vulpinoidea), flat stem spikerush, (Eleocharis compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinate).
