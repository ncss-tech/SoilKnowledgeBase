    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Lawet soils were previously mapped in the Gibbon, Lamo, and Leshara series.  A somewhat poorly drained phase has been mapped and will need future investigations for possible new series. Phases recognized to date include drained, wet, ponded, and saline-alkali.\nOSD modification RRZ 7/2002: Within 38 centimeters (15 inches) of the soil surface the calcium carbonate equivalent may be as low as 12 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 46 centimeters (18 inches) (Ak and ABk horizons)\ncalcic horizon--the zone from surface of the soil to about 140 centimeters (55 inches) (Ak, ABk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).\nIn Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with sedges (Carex emoryi, C. laeviconica, C. pellita, C. vulpinoidea), flat stem spikerush, (Eleocharis compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinate).
