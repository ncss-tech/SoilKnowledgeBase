  "OVERVIEW": "The Losindios series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale.  Losindios soils are on toeslopes and valleys.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
