    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the sandstone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 (3 through 5 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically fine sandy loam, but the range includes loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam.  Sandstone gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon that is intermediate in color and texture between the A and the C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 through 8 (4 through 7 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically gravelly fine sandy loam, but the range includes gravelly loamy very fine sand and gravelly sandy loam.  Sandstone gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent by volume.  Some pedons have less than 15 percent sandstone gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is calcareous sandstone bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Mariaville series in the same family and the Canyon, Epping, Niobrara and Tassel series in closely related families.  Mariaville soils contain more silt and clay in the control section and formed in residuum weathered from siltstone.  Canyon and Tassel soils have a drier moisture regime.  In addition, Canyon soils have more clay in the control section.  Epping soils contain more clay in the control section, have a drier moisture regime and formed in residuum from siltstone.  Niobrara soils are sandy in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longpine soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from sandstone on valley sides and uplands.  On valley sides they are on shoulders and the upper third of back slopes.  On uplands, they are on flats, low ridges, hillsides, and buttes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F."

Anselmo soils are very deep and are on flats, low ridges, and hillslopes.  Brunswick soils are moderately deep over sandstone and are on hillslopes and valley sides.  Duda and Dunday soils have a sandy particle size control section.  Duda soils are moderately deep over sandstone, and are on flats, hillslopes and valley sides.  Dunday soils are very deep and are on flats, low ridges and hillslopes.  Hennings soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section, are deep over sandstone and are on flats and hillslopes. Holt and Ronson soils are moderately deep over sandstone and are on flats, low ridges and hillsides.  Ronson soils are also on valley sides.  McKelvie, Simeon and Valentine soils have a sandy particle size control section and are very deep.  McKelvie soils are on back slopes and foot slopes of valley sides.  Simeon soils are on flats and hillslopes of uplands and back slopes of valley sides.  Valentine soils are on hummocks and dunes in the sandhills."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 5 inches (the A horizon) paralithic contact--at a depth of 14 inches; below this depth roots penetrate cracks in the rock.  The cracks are greater than 4 inches apart.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
