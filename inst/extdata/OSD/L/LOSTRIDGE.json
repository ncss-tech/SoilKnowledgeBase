  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and tuff-breccia.  Lostridge soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 55 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
