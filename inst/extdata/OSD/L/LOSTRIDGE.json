  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on planar to convex-shaped backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 55 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
