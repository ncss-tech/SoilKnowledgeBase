The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay, and averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The upper part is gravelly silty clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  The lower part is very gravelly silty clay loam and is absent in many pedons.  The upper part has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  The upper lower has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles."
