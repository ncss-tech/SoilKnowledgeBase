  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostpete series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and minor amounts of colluvium from gneiss or granite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The are on mountain slopes, benches, and ridges. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 10 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
