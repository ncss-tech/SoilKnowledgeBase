  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 to 64 degrees F. and usually is not below 47 degrees at any time.  The soil at depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from late April to May until November or early December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick and the organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.  The A horizons are dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark gray and gray in hues of 10YR and 7.5YR.  Textures include clay loam, silty clay loam, clay and silty clay.  The B horizons are dark brown, dark grayish brown, gray and light gray in hues of 10YR and 7.5YR.  Dry and moist chromas are 1 and 2. Strong brown to olive brown mottles occur at depths of less than 30 inches.  Textures are clays, and silty clays in the upper B horizon and include clays, silty clays, clay loams, and silty clay loams in the lower B horizon.  Structure is coarse prismatic or medium and coarse subangular blocky.  They are moderately to strongly effervescent with lime disseminated, as concretions and in seams.  Reaction is mildly to strongly alkaline.  The C horizons are brown, pale brown, gray and light gray in hues of 10YR.  Textures range from clays to silty clay loams. Chromas are 1 to 3 moist.  Mottles are common to many and distinct or prominent with olive brown to strong brown colors.  They are weakly to moderately cemented and firm or very firm moist."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chino, Clear Lake, Hildreth, Myers and Sacramento series.  Chino soils have less than 35 percent clay in their control section.  Clear Lake soils have slickensides.  Myers soils have slickensides and lack low chroma mottles at depths of less than 30 inches.  Sacramento soils have over 60 percent clay in their control section and have mottles in their mollic epipedon.  Hildreth soils have mottles in their mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Landlow soils are on nearly level basins of valley plains at elevations of 25 to 150 feet.  They formed in moderately fine textured alluvium.  The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. Average January temperature is 44 degrees F.; average July temperature is 78 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 230 to 290 days."

Lewis and Yokohl soils have ochric epipedons, and argillic horizons underlain by a duripan.  Marvin soils have argillic horizons."
