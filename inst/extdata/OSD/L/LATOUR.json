These soils formed in talus and colluvium from metasedimentary rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,200 feet.  The climate is cold, humid, with cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 38 to 55 inches, and the average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 30 to 75 days."
