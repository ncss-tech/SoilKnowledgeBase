  "OVERVIEW": "The Latour series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and ridgetops.  They formed in talus and colluvium from metasedimentary rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
