  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Silt plus clay content ranges from 5 to 10 percent, and moisture equivalent is 2 percent or more within the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Textures of sand or fine sand occur uniformly to depths of more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly or very strongly acid except in the A horizon when limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Most sand grains are thinly but well coated with silt and clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  A few uncoated sand grains occur, particularly in the lighter colored horizons.  In some pedons there are thin discontinuous lamellae below a depth of 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Gainesville series in the same family; in closely similar families are Astatula and Candler series.  Gainesville soils have 10 to 25 percent silt plus clay within the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Astatula and Candler soils are in uncoated families."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lake soils occur on nearly level to steep uplands in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Gradients range to about 30 percent.  These soils formed in beds of sandy marine, aeolian, or fluvial sediments more than 7 feet thick.  At the type location, mean annual precipitation is 50 or more inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F."

Apopka and Arredondo soils have Bt horizons at depths of more than 40 inches.  Tavares soils are in lower landscapes and are not as well drained."
