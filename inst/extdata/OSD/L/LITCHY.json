Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.

The particle-size control section is from 11 to 37 inches.  This series also meets the saturation duration for Oxyaquic subgroup and the aluminum requirements for alic subgroup and Fulvi great group criteria.  All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon S93WA-027-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
