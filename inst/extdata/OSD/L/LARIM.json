  "OVERVIEW": "The Larim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium generated during the late Pleistocene. They are on relict terraces, escarpment caps, and remnant pediment toeslopes. Slopes are typically 2 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
