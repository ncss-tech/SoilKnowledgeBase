  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 11 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation, including Btk horizons, is 6 to 13 inches, and depth to a lithologic discontinuity of very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand is 11 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F.  Salinity throughout the 0- to 60-inch depth is less than 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Organic carbon exceeds .6 percent in this horizon 2 to 4 inches deep, but the horizon does not meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon in color when it exceeds 4 inches in thickness.  This horizon is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam and averages 20 to 45 percent rounded pebbles.  It ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly clay loam and averages 22 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 28 percent silt, and 40 to 70 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and are 35 to 60 percent rounded pebbles and 0 to 10 percent rounded cobbles.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly clay loam with clay, silt, and sand ranges as stated in the B21t horizon.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and 35 to 60 percent rounded pebbles and 0 to 10 percent rounded cobbles.  This horizon is moderately alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, or extremely sandy.  Coarse fragments range from 40 to 80 percent and are 40 to 80 percent rounded pebbles and 0 to 10 percent rounded cobbles.  It contains from 7 to 14 percent secondary carbonate and qualifies as a calcic horizon.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
