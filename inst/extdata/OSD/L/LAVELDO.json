  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Laveldo series consists of deep, moderately fine-textured Soloschaks on lake bars or embankments in the Red Desert soils zone. Parent material is from a wide mixture of rocks. Laveldo soils are well- and moderately well-drained but lime carbonate in the profile has accumulated during periods of imperfect drainage. Present vegetation consists of a very sparse stand of small individual plants of creosote and white bursage. These soils have a weak erosion pavement of hard lime fragments and nodules. Below this is a thin vesicular A2, a thin weak prismatic moderately fine-texturet Bk horizon high in medium platy lime-cemented fragments over massive Bk horizons. A1 horizons are high in salts and pH ranges from 9 at the surface to 8 in the substratum.  These soils have resisted erosion and usually protrude 2 to 4 inches above adjoining soils at the crest of lake-formed bars.\nAssociated soils are Ireteba, which are usually immediately above, and Mead soils which are immediately below the Laveldo. No other Solonchaks are known to have horizons comparable to those of this series. A total of 507 acres of this soil occurs in Eldorado Valley of Clark County, Nevada.\nLaveldo soils occur at approximately 1,700 feet above sea level in a warm desert climate where the annual precipitation is about 5 inches; the average January temperature 45 degrees F., July 86 degreees F.; the mean annual F., and the average annual growing season about 240 days.",

The nodules are usually somewhat angular to subangular, many are teat-like on the outer sides and some are branched, like antlers. Occasionsl nodules range up to 2 inches in diameter."
