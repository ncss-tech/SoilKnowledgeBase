  "OVERVIEW": "The Lillings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Lillings soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, terraces, and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
