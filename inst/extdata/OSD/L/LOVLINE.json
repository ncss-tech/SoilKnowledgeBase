  "OVERVIEW": "The Lovline series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils on hills.  They formed in colluvium weathered from\nBurnt River schist and shale with an influence of loess and\nvolcanic ash.  Lovline soils are on slopes of 2 to 70\npercent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches,\nand the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F from\nApril to November and above 47 degrees F from May to\nOctober.  The soil is dry throughout from mid-June to\nOctober and is moist in some part during May to mid-June and mid-October to November.  The soils are moist for 45 to 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 47\ndegrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and\nchroma of 2 moist and dry in the A, and 2 or 3 in the AB\nhorizon.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and\nchroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, channery loam,\nor channery clay loam with 15 percent or more fine sand or\ncoarser.  The clay content is 18 to 35 percent."
