Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 1.2 to 4.9 m (4 to 16 ft).  The microknoll makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate or area between the knoll and depression about 60 percent, and the microdepression about 20 percent or less.  The angle of the slickenside ranges from about 10 to 65 degrees from horizontal and tend to be more vertical in microknolls than in microdepressions. The amplitude of waviness between mollic colored matrix in the upper part of the solum and the higher value colors in the lower part ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  When dry, the soil has cracks 1 to 5 cm (1/2 to 2 in) wide at the surface and extend to a depth of 30 cm (12 in) or more.
