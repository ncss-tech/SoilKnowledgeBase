  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to lithic contact with hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout the profile, unless the surface has been limed.  Flakes of mica range from few to common throughout.  Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent in the A, AB, and BA horizons and 35 to 60 percent in the Bt and BC horizons.  These fragments consist mainly of pebbles and cobbles from mica schist or sillimanite schist.  Most areas have stones scattered about on the surface and are mapped as stony phases.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  A horizons with moist value of 3 and dry value of 5 or less, are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nIn some pedons, there is a BC horizon with colors similar to that of the Bt horizon.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nIn some pedons, there is a Cr horizon of multicolored, weathered mica schist or sillimanite schist.  It is partially consolidated and excavation difficulty is high.\nThe R horizon is hard, fractured bedrock from high-grade metamorphic rock such as mica schist and sillimanite schist.  Vertical and horizontal fractures are thinly coated or filled with fine-earth.  The R horizon is consolidated and excavation difficulty is very high or extremely high."

Slopes are commonly 25 to 60 percent, but range from 8 to 70 percent.  They formed in residuum weathered from mica schist and sillimanite schist.
