  "OVERVIEW": "The Coyote series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in granitic alluvium. The Coyote soils are on upper sideslopes and summits of highly dissected erosional fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
