  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to a\nparalithic contact are 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2),\nor light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  Moist colors are dark gray\n(10YR 4/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown\n(10YR 3/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark grayish\nbrown (10YR 4/2).  Where moist values are less than 3.5 the\nhorizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is loam or\nsilt loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is greater than 25\npercent.\nThe B2 horizons are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2),\nlight gray (10YR 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 7/2), light olive gray (5Y\n6/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4), pale yellow (2.5Y 7.4; 5Y 7/3, 7/4),\nor pale olive (5Y 6/3, 6/4).  Mottles of very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, pale brown, very pale brown, grayish brown,\nolive yellow, or yellow ranges from none to common faint to\ndistinct.  Gray colors are due to high lime content.  The control section is loam or silt loam, and has a noncarebonate clay content\nof about 10 to 18 percent and a calcium carbonate equivalent of 40\nto 75 percent.  The Cca horizon is light brownish gray, light\ngray, or light olive brown.  It is fractured calcareous shale\nwith, in some pedons, thin layers of clay loam or loam between\nshale plates.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is about 45 to 80 percent.\nThe C horizon is gray or light gray massive shale.  Hardness is\nabout 2 on Moh's scale."

Altoga, Austin,\nFerris, and Stephen soils have over 35 percent total clay in the control section.  In addition, Altoga soils lack a paralithic\ncontact within 40 inches.  Eddy soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick.  Engle and Venus soils have a mollic epipedon.\nGotebo, Lamar, and Woodward soils have less than 40 percent carbonates in the control section.  Lamar soils also have\nfine-loamy control sections.  Sumter soils have a fine-silty\ncontrol section and are dry in the moisture control section for shorter periods of time."

The soils formed in materials weathered from stratified, calcareous shale.  Climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E\nindex ranges from 56 to 76."
