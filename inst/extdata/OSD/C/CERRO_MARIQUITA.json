  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured unconsolidated rock ranges from 11 to 18 inches.  Depth to hard consolidated chert bedrock ranges from 15 to 25 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 20 to 55 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Content of paragravels and paracobbles range from 25 to 65 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated basalt, chert or rhyolite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured basalt, chert, or rhyolite bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum and colluvium material weathered from basalt, chert and rhyolite.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 82 degrees F."

Llanos Costa (T) soils are on alluvial fans, are very deep and have clayey-skeletal subsoil.  Maguayo soils are on alluvial fans, are very deep and have clayey subsoils.  Cerro Mariquita soil formed in the Mariquita Chert Formation (KJm)."
