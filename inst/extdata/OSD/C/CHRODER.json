Bluechief soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and hues redder than 7.5YR.  Hiko Springs and Trook soils have more than 15 percent pebble size coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  McCutchen, Moffat, Nakai, and Nuahs soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 52 degrees F. and greater.  In addition, Nuahs soils have an electrical conductivity of 2 to 16 mmhos.  Pagina soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Kinan soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Nageezi and Nakoy soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the particle-size control section.  Kaito soils are deep with a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."
