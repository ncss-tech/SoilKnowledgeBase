  "OVERVIEW": "The Chillybu series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in material derived from herbaceous plants over mineral soil.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
