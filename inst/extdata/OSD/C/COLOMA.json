Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1040 mm (28 to 41 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.6 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F). The frost-free period is 135 to 200 days.

Okee soils are nearby on moraines and have 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of a sandy outwash or eolian mantle over loamy till. Plainfield soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Coloma soils but do not have lamellae. Richford soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Coloma soils and have a thin sandy loam argillic horizon. Spinks soils have total accumulations of lamellae greater than 15 cm (6 inches) thick."
