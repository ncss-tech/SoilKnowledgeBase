  "OVERVIEW": "The Coloma series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained or excessively drained soils formed in sandy drift. These soils are on moraines, outwash plains, deltas, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
