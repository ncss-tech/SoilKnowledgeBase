  "OVERVIEW": "The Comitas series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These nearly level to undulating soils formed in eolian sands over eolian deposits and alluvium of the Sand Sheet Prairie. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).",
