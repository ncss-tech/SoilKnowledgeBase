Boswell soils have solum thickness exceeding 60 inches and clayey Bt horizons which crack during dry seasons.  Counts soils have hues of 2.5Y through 7.5YR in the Bt horizon with sola thicker than 60 inches.  Gore soils have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B3 horizons and reddish clay C horizons which are medium acid through mildly alkaline.  Homa soils have very-fine textures.  Luverne soils lack mottles in the B2 horizons.  Susquehanna soils have sola thickness exceeding 60 inches and montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Wister soils have upper Bt horizons in color hue of 10YR."
