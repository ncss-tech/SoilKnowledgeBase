  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Cotopaxi soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Base saturation ranges from 80 to 100 percent. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 14 percent in a majority of subhorizons of the control section. The 10- to 40-inch control section is loamy sand or sand. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but typically are less than one percent. They are normally less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter. The A and C horizons are neutral or mildly alkaline. Clay content is less than 12 percent and silt ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual soil temperature ranges 44 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, and value of 5 or 6 dry."

Corlett soils are very strongly alkaline and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium. Costilla soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments. Space City soils are calcareous above depth of 40 inches."

They formed in eolian sandy alluvium from a variety of sources. The average annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 44 degrees F, averaging about 42 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F."
