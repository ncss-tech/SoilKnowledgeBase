  "STATES": "MD,PA,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cardiff series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from hard quartzitic slate, phyllite, or other fine-grained rock. They are nearly level to steep soils on uplands. Typically these soils have channery silt loam A horizons, and very channery loam Bw horizons over very channery silt C horizons.  Hard slate bedrock is below 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 35 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 70 percent in the solum, and average more than 75 percent in the C horizon and 90 percent in the Cr horizon.  The fragments consist of gray to light gray slate or other fine-grained rock.  Reaction (unlimed) is strongly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3, with the lowest value confined to the thin A horizon and the highest value to the E horizon in undisturbed pedons. The A horizon is channery silt loam or channery loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  The clay content ranges from about 12 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon were present has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is channery or extremely channery analogues of loam, silt loam or silt."

The soils formed in residual material weathered from hard, light colored, quartzitic slate, phyllite or other fine-grained rock.  The mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

Airy soils are of the same subgroup as Cardiff soils, but both have micaceous mineralogy.  In addition the Manor soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."
