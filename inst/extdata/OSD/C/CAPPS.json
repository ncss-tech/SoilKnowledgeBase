  "OVERVIEW": "The Capps series consists of deep, well drained, moderately\npermeable soils.  They formed in moderately fine texture\nsediments that have been influenced by wind erosion.  They\nare on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range\nfrom 0 to 3 percent.",

Depth to free\ncalcium carbonate ranges from 7 to 24 inches.  The 10- to\n40-inch control section ranges from loam to clay loam with\nclay content ranging from 25 to 35 percent and with more\nthan 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon is brown to dark grayish brown with hue of\n7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chromas of 2 or 3.\nThickness of the A horizon with moist values and chromas of\nless than 3.5 ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The A horizon is\nfine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam, and mildly or\nmoderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon is grayish brown to pinkish gray in hue of\n7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chromas of 2\nthrough 4.  It is loam or clay loam.\nThe Ck horizon is white, light gray, gray, pinkish gray,\npink, light reddish brown, or light brown in hue of 5YR\nthrough 10YR.  The amount of carbonates in the Ck horizon\nranges from about 20 to 60 percent by volume.  The zone of\ncarbonate accumulation extends to below 60 inches in most\npedons."
