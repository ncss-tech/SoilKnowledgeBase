  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm.  A few fine pebbles occur in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout, unless limed, but some sub-horizon within the control section has a reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons have buried horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Dry value is 6 or 7.  Undisturbed areas have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick, that has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  They have weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  At least one sub-horizon between a depth of 10 and 30 inches has a hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand, and in some pedons below 100 cm, there are strata of silt loam to fine gravel with gravel ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  The upper part of the C horizon  has weak, fine or medium granular structure or it is massive.  The lower part of the C horizon is massive or single grain. Consistence ranges from loose to friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Ermatinger and Meadowpeak series are in the same family.  The Ermatinger soils are less acid having slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline reaction in the substratum.  The Meadowpeak soils lack redox concentrations above 89 cm.  Both Ermatinger and Meadowpeak soils are in areas of lower precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Charles soils are on flood plains that are commonly in broad depressions.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in recent alluvial deposits. Flooding generally occurs once or twice annually, but may occur less often than once in 2 years in some places.  Overflow generally occurs during spring runoff and during heavy rains.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1219 mm, and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 3 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 3 to 610 m above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the  Adams, Allagash, Colton, Cornish, Croghan, Duxbury, Fryeburg, Lovewell, Madawaska, Medomak, Nicholville, and Salmon soils.  Adams, Allagash, Colton, Croghan, Duxbury, Madawaska, Nicholville, and Salmon are better drained soils on adjacent outwash plains, deltas and terraces.  Cornish, Fryeburg and  Lovewell soils are better drained soils in higher positions on flood plains.  Medomak soils are very poorly drained and in more depressional areas of flood plains."

Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high within a depth of 100 cm and moderately high to very high in the silt loam to fine gravel strata where present, below 100 cm.  Runoff is negligible or very high."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Charles series replaces some soils formerly mapped Limerick that have a frigid soil temperature regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 cm (Ap horizon).\n2.  Fluvaquents feature - the content of organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.\n3.  Aquic conditions - redox features within the Ap horizon and throughout the C horizons.\n4.  Aeric feature - hue of 2.5Y value of 5 or less and a chroma of 2 or more between the Ap and 75 cm (Cg1 horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 145, July 1991.\nSoil Interpretation Record Numbers for the Charles series are: Charles, ME0082; and Charles, stratified substratum, ME0120.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
