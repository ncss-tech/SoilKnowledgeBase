The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 64 degrees F. The particle size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay, and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel in size.  Mineralogy is smectitic. Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of 10 inches. The soils usually are dry in the soil moisture control zone from May 1 to October 31, 180 days, and moist the rest of the year. Reversible surface- initiated cracks  to 2 inches wide extend to a depth of 25 inches or more when the soil is not irrigated. Slickensides range from common to many in the Bss horizon from about 10 to 40 inches or more.

Texture is heavy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction ranges from 5.6 to 8.4 and the horizon is non-calcareous. Some pedons have A/B horizons in which there is evidence of mixing of the A horizon and the Bss horizon soil material with small to large clumps of mixed soil material.\nThe Bss horizons dry color is 10YR 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2, 3/1; 5Y 6/2, 3/1; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2 or 4/1.

Aido, Alo, Auld, Bonsanko and Vaquero soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Altamont soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches. Cibo and Sehorn soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Diablo soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 80 inches and have chromas of 1.5 or less in the A horizon. Myers soils lack segregated carbonates in the subsoil, have moist color values of 4, 5 or 6 in the A horizon, and are located in MLRA 17 with greater than 30 degrees F. between mean summer and mean winter temperatures. Porterville soils dominantly have hues of 5YR and 7.5YR and are located in MLRA 17 with greater than 30 degrees F. between mean summer and mean winter temperatures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cropley soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains and in small basins. Slopes are smooth and are 0 to 15 percent. Cropley soils formed in fine textured alluvium weathered from shale, sandstone and mudstone. Elevation is 10 to 2100 feet. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F. Average January temperature is about 49 degrees F. in most areas, but is about 56 degrees F. close to the coast of California; average July temperatures is about 68 degrees f. Frost free season is 200 to 330 days and up to 360 days along the coast."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nOfficial Cropley type location moved from existing site to new site near Milpitas, California, November, 2007 during soil survey of the Santa Clara area. Entire series description revised at that time. The Cropley series now includes some of the former Raynor soils more than 40 inches deep that were mapped on gentle smooth slopes.\nCropley series reclassified on September, 1994. Horizon designations and competing soils updated June 2001. Slope range expanded to 15 percent to accommodate observations in the Santa Monica Mountains October, 2001. Database search revealed well and moderately well drained components so well drained was added to the OSD for those components on floodplains, October 2004. Cropley soils mapped in Santa Cruz county near the Pacific Ocean do not open cracks until July and would not meet the criteria of 180 days dry for the Aridic subgroup.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NASIS SITE ID: 07ca085641468, NSSL Lab Data 69CA071026\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
