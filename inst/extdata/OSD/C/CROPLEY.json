Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of 10 inches. The soils usually are dry in the soil moisture control zone from May 1 to October 31, 180 days, and moist the rest of the year. Reversible surface- initiated cracks  to 2 inches wide extend to a depth of 25 inches or more when the soil is not irrigated. Slickensides range from common to many in the Bss horizon from about 10 to 40 inches or more.

Cropley soils formed in fine textured alluvium weathered from shale, sandstone and mudstone. Elevation is 10 to 2100 feet. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F. Average January temperature is about 49 degrees F. in most areas, but is about 56 degrees F. close to the coast of California; average July temperatures is about 68 degrees f. Frost free season is 200 to 330 days and up to 360 days along the coast."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nOfficial Cropley type location moved from existing site to new site near Milpitas, California, November, 2007 during soil survey of the Santa Clara area. Entire series description revised at that time. The Cropley series now includes some of the former Raynor soils more than 40 inches deep that were mapped on gentle smooth slopes.\nCropley series reclassified on September, 1994. Horizon designations and competing soils updated June 2001. Slope range expanded to 15 percent to accommodate observations in the Santa Monica Mountains October, 2001. Database search revealed well and moderately well drained components so well drained was added to the OSD for those components on floodplains, October 2004. Cropley soils mapped in Santa Cruz county near the Pacific Ocean do not open cracks until July and would not meet the criteria of 180 days dry for the Aridic subgroup."
