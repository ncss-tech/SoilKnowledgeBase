  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Calpeak series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Calpeak soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 to 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
