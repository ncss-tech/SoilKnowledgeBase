  "OVERVIEW": "The Chilper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Chilper soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
