  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chilper soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks with some influence from a surface mantle of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,070 to 1,520 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
