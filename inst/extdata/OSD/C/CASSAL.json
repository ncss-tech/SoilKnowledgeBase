These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 12 to 18 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent clay.  A perched water table is present March to June at a depth of 36 to 60 inches.  Depth to distinct redoximorphic features is 30 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon has chromas of 1 or 2 moist.\nThe AB horizon has values of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy loam.  It has 5 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe 2C horizons have values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry, 1 to 3 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 25 to 35 percent pebbles and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Cd horizon has values of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 40 percent pebbles and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral."

These soils formed in glacial till with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevations are from 2,700 to 3,900 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  The mean January temperature is 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperatures is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
