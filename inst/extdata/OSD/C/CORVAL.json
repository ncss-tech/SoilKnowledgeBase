Crow Hill soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and contain large amounts of diatomaceous earth. Coyotecreek and Horst soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the textural control section. Moonbend soils are moderately well drained and stratified. Moonbend has temporary water tables, are effervescent and have greater than 40 percent silt. Suey soils formed in loess deposits on hills and terraces, average less than 27 percent clay in the textural control section and have a difference of 12 degrees F. between the mean winter and mean summer temperature."
