  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 95 centimeters.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 centimeters.  Coarse fragments are commonly lacking in the soil but range up to 5 percent in some pedons.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the solum or C horison.  The C horizon contains free carbonates.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Structure is moderate or strong, very fine to coarse granular or blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.  Some pedons have thin A2 horizons with chroma of 1 and ranging to silt loam in texture.\nThe B1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value or 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3 and it is mottled.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine through medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2 with both high and low chroma mottles.  Structure is moderate or strong, very fine through coarse subangular or angular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm, sticky or very sticky and plastic or very plastic.\nThe B3 or C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 and it is mottled.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  The B3 horizon has fine or very fine blocky structure within thick to medium plates or prisms. The C horizon is massive or massive within very coarse prisms."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils in related families are the Covington, Guffin, Kingsbury, Livingston, Roselms, Vergennes, and Wilpoint.  Covington, Kingsbury, Livingston, Roselms, and Vergennes soils are more than 1 meter deep to bedrock and have illitic minerology.  Also, Livingston soils lack argillic horizons.  Guffin soils are dominated by 2 chroma colors throughout, have darker surface layers and lack agrillic horizons.  Wilpoint soils have argillic horizons that are dominated by colors with chroma greater than 2."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chaumont soils are nearly level to gently sloping with slopes ranging from 0 to 8 percent.  The Chaumont soils are in slightly concave landforms where relative thin clayey marine sediments overlie hard bedrock.  The bedrock is primarily limestone with some areas underlain by granite, sandstone, or shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 degrees to 10 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 113 centimeters and mean annual growing season from 120 to 160 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the moderately well drained Wilpoint soils on higher lying convex areas and poorly drained and very poorly drained Guffin soils on lower lying concave areas which are in a drainage sequence with Chaumont, and the competing Covington, Kingsbury, Livingston, and Vergennes soils.  Also associated are the Benson, Newstead and Rhinebeck.  Benson and Newstead are shallow and moderately deep soils occurring on adjacent bedrock controlled till landscapes.  Rhinebeck soils are deep soils developed in lacustrine materials that contain slightly smaller amounts of clay."
