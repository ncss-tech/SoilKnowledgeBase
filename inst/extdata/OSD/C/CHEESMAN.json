  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Cheesman soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Base saturation is usually more than 90 percent, but ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The solum typically extends to the bedrock, but C horizons occur in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact is 50 to 100 cm.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 38 to 100 cm.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons, particularly in the surface horizons, but a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the bedrock have hue of 5YR or redder.  A high percentage of the sand fraction is angular and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock, and are mainly less than 75mm in diameter, but range from 2-250mm in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature is 7 degrees C (45 F), and the mean summer soil temperature is 18 degrees C (64 F).  The solum is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR through 5YR\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist;\nChroma: 1 through 3.\nBt horizon\nHue: 5YR through 10R\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist\nChroma: 1 through 6\nIt is typically coarse sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 40 to 70 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand."

Cheesman soils formed in parent materials weathered from underlying reddish brown and red arkosic sandstone of the Lyons and Fountain formations.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 430mm (17 inches), with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer."
