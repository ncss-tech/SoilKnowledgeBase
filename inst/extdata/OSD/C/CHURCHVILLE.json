  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Volume of rock fragments, mostly gravel and channers, range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 10 to 35 percent in the 2C horizon. Dominant chroma of more than 2 occurs in some subhorizons between the Ap and 30 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, moist value of 3 to 5 and dry value of 6 or 7, with chroma of 2 or 3. Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4, with common or many redoximorphic features. Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate blocky or platy, consistence is friable or firm and reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe B/E horizon, where present, has ped coats similar in color and texture to the E horizon. Total thickness of the skeletons between adjoining peds is less than 5 mm and less than 15 percent of the soil volume. Ped interiors (B portion) have color value of 4 or 5 and chroma from 2 to 4. Structure is weak or moderate blocky or platy, consistence is friable or firm and reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. In some pedons the E or B/E horizon is replaced by an E/B or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4, with common or many redoximorphic features. Ped coatings have chroma of 2 or less. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with a range in clay content from 35 to 55 percent. Structure is weak to strong, angular or subangular blocky, or prismatic. Clay films range from patchy to continuous on both horizontal and vertical ped faces. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4, with common or many redoximorphic features.\nThe 2C 0r 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redoximorphic features range from none to common. Texture of the fine earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Consistence is friable to very firm. Reaction is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Churchville soils are on nearly level to sloping areas of till plains where a thin deposit of fine textured pro-glacial lacustrine material overlies the till. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is mainly less than 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 42 inches and the average growing season is from 130 to 190 days. Average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F."

Cazenovia, Danley, Honeoye, Mohawk, Nunda, Ontario and their wetter associates are on adjacent till plains that lack the lacustrine deposit mantle. Odessa, Rhinebeck and Schoharie soils are associated in deeper lacustrine deposits."
