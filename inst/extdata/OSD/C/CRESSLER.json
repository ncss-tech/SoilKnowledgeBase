  "OVERVIEW": "The Cressler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt.  Cressler soils are on upland basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
