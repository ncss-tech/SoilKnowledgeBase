    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cressler soils are on upland basins. These soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 5,500 to 6,800 feet. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 26 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
