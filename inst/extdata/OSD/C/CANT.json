The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  An abrupt clay increase of 15 to 25 percent exists between the A and 2Bt1 horizons.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 10 to 24 inches.  The particle size control section has 35 to 55 percent clay and averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The texture is dominantly loam with 20 to 27 percent clay but it can range as high as 35 percent in some pedons.  It has 0 to 20 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 10 to 35 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 20 percent stones, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam, loam, or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  It has 5 to 40 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent."

Gooserock and Meadowridge soils have vitrandic properties in the surface and are very deep to bedrock.  Gooserock soils are on steep, north facing slopes whereas Meadowridge soils are on gently sloping benches.  Monroe soils are fine-loamy, very deep to bedrock, and are on flood plains.  Reywat soils are shallow to bedrock, loamy-skeletal, and are on ridgetops.  Simas soils are non-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon, and are on adjacent north slopes."
