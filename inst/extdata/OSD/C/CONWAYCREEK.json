  "OVERVIEW": "The Conwaycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on hillslopes, eroded fan remnants, mountain slopes and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degree C.",
