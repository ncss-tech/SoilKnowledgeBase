  "REVDATE": "04/2011",
  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cloverdale series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived mainly from rhyolite and basalt. These soils are on long broad slopes of alluvial fans and plains. Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.",
