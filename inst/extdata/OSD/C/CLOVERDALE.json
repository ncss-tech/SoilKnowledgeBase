  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on long broad slopes of alluvial fans and plains. These fans and plains are dissected by narrow intermittent drainage ways that are two to ten feet lower in relief. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The regolith is moderately fine and fine calcareous alluvium derived mainly from rhyolite and basalt. Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 6,000 feet. The mean annual air temperature is about 57 to 62 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches. The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

The principal vegetation is short and mid grasses, essentially tobosa, vine mesquite, sideoats grama, blue grama, and cane beardgrass.  Goldeneye is a common annual forb on these soils. Cholla cactus is a common invader on more sloping areas."
