Clear Lake and Hildreth soils are mildly to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Jacktone soils have a duripan at a depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Maxwell soils are moderately alkaline below 40 inches, have segregated lime at a depth of 24 to 56 inches, and do not have segregated gypsum.  Stockton soils do not have segregated gypsum.  Subaco soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Willows soils are strongly alkaline and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some or all parts."

The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."

Buttonwillow soils are on similar landforms, are clayey over loamy, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon.  Fages (T) and Millux (T) soils are on adjacent relic basin floors, are calcareous, have an SAR greater than 13, and do not have intersecting slickensides.  Lokern soils are on similar surfaces and do not have intersecting slickensides.  Zalvidea (T) soils are on similar landforms, are coarse-loamy, and have a gypsic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained, very slow runoff or ponded; slow permeability.  Copus soils have been artificially drained by dams and levees.  The soil now has a water table at a depth of 4 to 6 feet during the summer and at greater than 6 feet during the rest of the year.  The soils are still subject to rare flooding.  Some areas of this soil are subject to occasional very long periods of flooding between January and July when floodwaters from the Sierra Nevada mountains are diverted to designated basins.  During these times much of the basin, in which these Copus soils occur, is used as a temporary reservoir."
