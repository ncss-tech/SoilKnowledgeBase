  "OVERVIEW": "The Current Spring series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium primarily from quartzite, conglomerate and limestone.  Current Spring soils are on alluvial fans and low hillslopes.  Slope is 5 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
