  "OVERVIEW": "The Carey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in weakly consolidated silty or sandy sediments of Permian age. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping shoulders and summits of dissected terraces on uplands of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 14 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).",

    "content": "REMARKS:\nThese soils were formerly classified in the Reddish Chestnut great soil group.\nThe Carey series originally was considered as deep and very deep 100 to 178 cm (40 to 70 in) to Permian sediments. Most of the 100 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in) areas are in Oklahoma and interpretations have been developed for this soil. As these survey areas are updated, a new series will be developed to better define this soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  36 to 122 cm (14 to 48 in) (Bt horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTaxonomic version: Keys To Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
