Reaction ranges from extremely acid or very strongly acid in the A horizon, very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bt horizon, and strongly acid to slightly acid in the Btg and BC horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown yellow, red, and gray range from few to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hues of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Candelero soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, and foot slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  They formed in moderately fine-textured sediments that weathered from granitic rocks and are high in quartz, feldspar, and hornblende minerals.   The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 85 to 90 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 80 degrees F."

The well drained to excessively drained Mayo soils are on higher foot slope and fan positions and have coarse-loamy subsoils.  The moderately well drained Parcelas soils are on similar positions and have more clay in the subsoil."
