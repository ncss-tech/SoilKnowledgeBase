  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Candelero series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on terraces, alluvial fans, and foot slopes.  They formed in sediments that weathered from granitic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 87 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
