  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clayman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from volcanic rock.  Clayman soils are on fan remnants, mountain slopes, and pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.",
