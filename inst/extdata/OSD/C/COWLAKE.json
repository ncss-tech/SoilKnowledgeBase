  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowlake series consists of very shallow and shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum from basalt and rhyolite. Cowlake soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 270 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
