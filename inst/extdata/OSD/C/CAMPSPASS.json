The Citadel soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation and are mainly strongly acid above a depth of 23 inches.  The Fortwingate, Osoridge, and Pylon soils have lithic or paralithic bedrock at moderate depths.  The Fortwingate and Osoridge soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Also, the Pylon soils have a very hard or hard and massive surface, and an extremely hard argillic horizon.  The Goldvale and Larkson soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Kelvin soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation, or a thin dark A horizon.  The McVickers soils have the base of the argillic horizon at a depth of 40 inches or deeper, and do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  The Zuni soils formed in materials weathered from coarse grained granite and are free of carbonate throughout the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Campspass soils are on hill slopes, fan terraces, and benches.  They formed in colluvium and materials derived from consolidated sedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 3,500 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and materials derived from semiconsolidated sedimentary rock.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and early, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
