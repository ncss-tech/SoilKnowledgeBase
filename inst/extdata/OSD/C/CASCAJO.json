  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cascajo series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in very gravelly and sandy alluvium over shale or sandstone at depths of 4 to 20 feet.  Cascajo soils are on terraces, terrace edges and ridges and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Colors throughout the profile range from 7.5YR through 2.5Y in hue, 2 through 4 in chroma, and 4 through 8 in value.  Texture of the A, AC, and Ck horizons are modified with pebbles and cobbles and range from gravelly sandy loam through very gravelly or extremely cobbly sand or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon may range to extremely cobbly loamy sand or sand.\nThe A horizon is mildly to moderately alkaline.\nVolume of coarse fragments in the C ranges from 35 to 80 percent with 5 to 30 percent larger than 3 inches."
