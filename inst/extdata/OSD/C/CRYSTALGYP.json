  "OVERVIEW": "The Crystalgyp series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or residuum from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks.  Crystalgyp soils are on dissected relict lake beds.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
