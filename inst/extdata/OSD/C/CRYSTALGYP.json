These soils formed in mixed alluvium or residuum from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 230 days."
