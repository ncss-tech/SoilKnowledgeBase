  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Series classification change from Typic Albaqualfs to Albaquic Hapludalfs is due to interpretation of low chroma matrix as primarily lithochromic. However, the perched saturated zone above the argillic horizon following heavy rains is thought to cause some reduction of iron contributing partially to the gray matrix colors. Field observations, landscape position, presence of oxidation and reduction mottles and climate indicate the soil is moderately well drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon ----0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon ------ 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon --- 20 to 91 cm (8 to 36 in) (Bt and Bt/C horizons)\nAquic conditions --- 10 to 43 cm (4 to 17 in) (E and Bt1 horizons)\nParalithic contact - 91 cm (36 in) (top of the Cr horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lincoln Lab No. 69L193-69L201 of this soil with slightly different morphology near the type location. Chemical and physical analyses were run by Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station on the survey area typical pedon from Sabine Parish, Louisiana and are published in the Soil Survey of Sabine Parish, Louisiana (S87LA-085-23). Fertility analyses were run by Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station on the survey area typical pedon from Vernon Parish, Louisiana (S91LA-115-002).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
