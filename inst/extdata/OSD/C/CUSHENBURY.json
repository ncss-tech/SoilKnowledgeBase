    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact with weathered granitic rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 59 degrees F.  Soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches usually is moist in some part from late November to late April or early May, and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  The control section contains more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand in the fine earth fraction.  The soil has 5 to 25 percent gravel by volume.\nThe A horizon is brown or grayish brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/3).  It is typically loamy sand but ranges from gravelly loamy sand, sandy loam to gravelly sandy loam and averages 4 to 8 percent clay.  It is neutral in the upper part but ranges to slightly acid in the lower part.  The base saturation ranges from 75 to 90 percent.  Organic matter decreases to less than 1 percent at a depth of about 14 inches in the A horizon.\nThe B2t horizon is yellowish brown, brown, or strong brown (10YR 5/4, 5/3,; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8).  It is gravelly sandy loam, or sandy loam averages 4 to 10 percent clay and has an increase of only 1 to 2 percent.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  This horizon has moderate to strong, medium to coarse, angular or subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is brown or yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4).  It is gravelly sandy loam or sandy loam and is slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cushenbury soils are on hilly uplands and have gradients of 15 to 30 percent.  They formed in residuum from grandiorite, granite, and other granitic rocks.  Rock out crop commonly occurs with soil.  Elevations are 4,500 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal having cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Th mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches of which 1/4 to 1/2 falls as snow.  The average January temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost free season is 150 to 175 days."
