    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 72 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Gravel content is variable in most pedons because of stratification and ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons, 0 to 60 percent in the 2Bt horizon, and 5 to 60 percent in the 2C horizon, except for a few thin lenses that range up to 80 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid. Some undisturbed pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.\nThe E horizon, where present, is 3 to 8 inches thick has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It ranges from 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle size control section. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.

Bearthicket, Elkinsville, Olephant, Parke, Pike, and Ricket soils have an argillic horizon deeper than 80 inches. Tobinsport soils have no rock fragments in the control section.  Wellrock soils have paralithic contact which ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Wellston soils have lithic or paralithic contact which ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  The Angatoka, Eilertsen, Kurtz, Rosine, and Vernonia series were formerly in the same family, but have been assigned a CEC activity class at the present time. The Alford series is superactive."
