  "OVERVIEW": "The Cidermill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of silty material 24 to 40 inches thick and in the underlying stratified glacial outwash deposits on treads on stream terraces. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum and rapid in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Texture is silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid. Some undisturbed pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.\nThe E horizon, where present, is 3 to 8 inches thick has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.
