  "OVERVIEW": "The Castan series consists of very deep, well drained soils on escarpments of volcanic plateaus. These soils formed in local alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from tephra and loess. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Castan soils have moderately rapid permeability. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 33 degrees F.",
