This soil formed in local alluvium, colluvium or residuum from tephra and loess. The rock fragments and sand size fraction are dominantly obsidian. Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Average annual air temperature is 30 to 37 degrees F. Frost may occur at anytime throughout the year."

Oleo soils have an argillic horizon and average less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the solum. Lasac soils occur intermixed with the Castan soils on convex slope positions. They are less than 20 inches to substratum layers of tephra."
