  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clarksdale soils are on summits and side slopes on loess-mantled ground moraines. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 2 percent but range to 7 percent. Clarksdale soils formed in loess. They are in areas on uplands between Typic Hapludalfs on crests and side slopes near drainageways and Argiudolls on ground moraines farther from the drainageways. Climate is midcontinental with hot summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10.0  to 12.2  degrees C. (50 to 54 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 305 meters (400 feet to 1000 feet) above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Downs, Ipava, Keomah, Rozetta, Rushville, and Sable soils. The moderately well drained Downs and Rozetta soils are in similar and more sloping areas. Ipava and Keomah soils are on similar nearby landscapes and form a biosequence with Clarksdale soils. The poorly drained Rushville soils do not have a dark surface layer and are on nearly level or slightly depressional areas. The poorly drained Sable soils have mollic epipedons and are typically on broad upland areas farther from the dissecting drainageways than Clarksdale soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the most restrictive layers. Permeability is moderately slow in the most restrictive layers. In undisturbed areas, the seasonal high water table is above a depth of 51 cm (20 inches) for some time in normal years. Where artificially drained it is above a depth of 91 cm (36 inches) for short periods in spring in normal years."
