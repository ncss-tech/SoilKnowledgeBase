Wedge-shaped peds occur in subhorizons of some pedons and are bounded on upper and lower faces by slickensides.\nRedoximorphic features:  Redox concentrations occur as masses of iron or manganese accumulation and range from few to many, fine to coarse, and distinct or prominent.  Colors have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Redox depletion of iron has occurred in the matrix and is often indicated by strong gleying.\nGypsum content: 0 to 5 percent.\nSecondary gypsum and/or sodium sulfate: Crystals and masses range from few to many and fine to coarse where present, but they are absent in some horizons or pedons.\nOther features: Some pedons have subhorizons with few masses of identifiable secondary carbonates; few thin (less than 3 cm) strata of sand or loamy textures occur in some pedons; some pedons have subhorizons with masses or lenses of organic carbon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 64 cm (A, Ayz, Bssz1, and Bssz2 horizons).\nSlickensides - The zone from 25 to 104 cm (Bssz1, Bssz2, and Bkssz horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 64 to 152 cm (Bkssz and Bkz horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 50 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bssz2, Bkssz, and Bkz horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bssz1 and Bssz2 horizons and part of the Bkssz horizon).\nThe revision of September 2008 updated the taxonomic class from Typic Natraquerts based on a pending revision to the Keys for Soil Taxonomy involving Natraquerts, the lack of a natric horizon, and a reinterpretation of the depth to aquic conditions.  The typical pedon was also moved from the prior location in reclaimed cropland to a new type location that better represents the natural chemical properties of the Carson series.\nThe revision of August 2000 updated the taxonomic class from Fluvaquentic Vertic Endoaquolls to Typic Natraquerts, updated horizon designations, and clarified the vertic features displayed in this soil."
