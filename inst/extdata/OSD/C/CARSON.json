Wedge-shaped peds occur in subhorizons of some pedons and are bounded on upper and lower faces by slickensides.\nRedoximorphic features:  Redox concentrations occur as masses of iron or manganese accumulation and range from few to many, fine to coarse, and distinct or prominent.  Colors have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Redox depletion of iron has occurred in the matrix and is often indicated by strong gleying.\nGypsum content: 0 to 5 percent.\nSecondary gypsum and/or sodium sulfate: Crystals and masses range from few to many and fine to coarse where present, but they are absent in some horizons or pedons.\nOther features: Some pedons have subhorizons with few masses of identifiable secondary carbonates; few thin (less than 3 cm) strata of sand or loamy textures occur in some pedons; some pedons have subhorizons with masses or lenses of organic carbon."

The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 64 cm (A, Ayz, Bssz1, and Bssz2 horizons).\nSlickensides - The zone from 25 to 104 cm (Bssz1, Bssz2, and Bkssz horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 64 to 152 cm (Bkssz and Bkz horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 50 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bssz2, Bkssz, and Bkz horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bssz1 and Bssz2 horizons and part of the Bkssz horizon).\nThe revision of September 2008 updated the taxonomic class from Typic Natraquerts based on a pending revision to the Keys for Soil Taxonomy involving Natraquerts, the lack of a natric horizon, and a reinterpretation of the depth to aquic conditions.  The typical pedon was also moved from the prior location in reclaimed cropland to a new type location that better represents the natural chemical properties of the Carson series.\nThe revision of August 2000 updated the taxonomic class from Fluvaquentic Vertic Endoaquolls to Typic Natraquerts, updated horizon designations, and clarified the vertic features displayed in this soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The new typical pedon has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as user pedon ID 99NV001006 (pedon # 00P0244).  The typical pedon at the previous series type location was sampled in 1959 and characterized by the soil survey laboratory in Riverside, CA as sample number S59Nev-1-2.  The data is published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23 on page 185.  The current user pedon ID is 1959NV001002 (pedon # 40A3236).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
