The somewhat poorly drained Sundell soils and poorly drained Nahma soils form a drainage sequence with Cunard soils. Associated loamy soils less than 50 cm (20 inches) deep are the Summerville soils, somewhat poorly drained Ensign soils, and poorly drained or very poorly drained Ruse soils. Emmet, Omena, and Onaway soils are very deep, loamy soils on adjacent uplands."
