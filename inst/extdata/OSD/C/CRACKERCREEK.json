  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crackercreek series consists of deep, well drained soils on north- facing mountainsides and canyon walls.  These soils formed in a volcanic ash mantle over colluvium weathered from basalt.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  Elevation is 3,200 to 4,800 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 40 inches, the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average frost-free season is 60 to 110 days.",
