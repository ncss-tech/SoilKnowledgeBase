  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 35 to more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to medium acid throughout the rest of the profile.  The base saturation is 35 to 50 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Few to common dark brown, or brown nodules or concretions are throughout the soil in most pedons.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma or 0 to 3.  This horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 with mottles in shades of gray in the middle and lower part.  Mottles in shades of red are in most pedons.  The B2t horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The average clay content of the particle size control section is 10 to 18 percent with more than 30 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe B3 horizon, where present, has colors like the B2t horizon, or it is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. The C horizon has colors like the B3 horizon.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam."
