  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used almost exclusively as rangeland.  A few small scattered areas are irrigated mainly to perennial grasses.  The original plant community was open grassland dominated by short and mid-grasses with occasional mesquite trees and woody shrubs.  Bundleflower was an important forb.  In early stages of retrogression, plants such as pink pappusgrass and curlymesquite increase, but decrease with further deterioration.  With further retrogression, whorled dropseed, pricklypear cactus and Texas varilla increase significantly.  Other plants which increase or invade are mesquite, spiny hackberry, twisted acacia, condalia, dwarf screwbean, and other cacti."
