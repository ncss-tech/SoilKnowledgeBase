Elioak soils, that develop from mica schist and contain more silt and mica flakes, are on similar landscape positions. Edgemont and Glenelg soils, that have brown subsoils with less clay, are on similar landscape positions. Hazel soils, that have less clay in the subsoil and are shallower to bedrock, are on steep sideslopes. Swampoodle and Meadowville soils, that have brown subsoils with less clay and are shallower to seasonal high water table, are in depressions, heads of drains and drainageways."
