    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A and C horizon is more than 72 inches of fine to coarse sand.  The soil is medium acid through moderately alkaline.  Small calcareous shell fragments are present in some pedons.  The soil contains a few to many grains of black, red, pink, dark brown, and white minerals.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 3.\nThe upper C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 4.  High chroma mottles are few to common in most pedons.  Redox depletions occur as mottles or matrix colors within depths of 15 to 40 inches of the surface.\nThe Ab horizon, when present, occurs at depths of 24 to 72 inches below the surface and is similar in color to the A horizon.  It contains few to common pieces of undecomposed plant materials.\nThe lower C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Corolla soils are on nearly level flats and gentle slopes between dunes and next to depressions and sloughs along the coast at elevations generally below about 15 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soil formed in sandy sediments reworked by waves and wind.   Average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and mean annual temperature about 62 degrees F., near the type location.  Some of these soils may be flooded during hurricanes."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carteret, Currituck, Duckston, and Newhan series.  Carteret soils are on nearly level tidal marshes that are flooded by daily tides.  Currituck is an organic soil with 16 to 51 inches of organic material over sand.  They are on nearly level marshes that flood with fresh water.  The poorly drained Duckston soils are commonly located in depressions and lower lying parts of the landscape.  The excessively drained Newhan soils are common on the more sloping parts of the landscape."
