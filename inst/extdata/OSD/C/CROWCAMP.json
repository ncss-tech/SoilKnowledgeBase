    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The soils are dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  There is a 15 to 20 percent clay increase (absolute) between the A and 2Bt horizons.  Depth to the hard brittle layer is 25 to 40 inches.  The soil is ponded in the spring from about March to April.  There is an apparent water table at 2.5 to 5.0 feet from March to May. Linear extensibility of the upper 100 cm is 6.0 cm or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The upper 7 inches when mixed has value of 5 dry and 3 moist.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It is clay or silty clay, with 40 to 55 percent clay.  It has pressure faces and faint clay films.\nThe 3B and 3C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or gravelly loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel.  The 4C horizon is gravelly or very gravelly loam with 20 to 50 percent gravel."
