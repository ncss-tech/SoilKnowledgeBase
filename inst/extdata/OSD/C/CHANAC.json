  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the hard and massive C horizon is 38 to 101 centimeters (15 to 40 inches). The soil between depths of 15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches) becomes moist in some part in early November and remains moist until the middle of March. It has a xeric moisture regime bordering on aridic. Mean annual soil temperature is 16 to 21 degrees C (60 to 70 degrees F). The soil may be littered on the surface by 2 mm to 2.5 cm pebbles, but has less than 10 percent rock fragments in the profile. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. It has less than 1 percent organic matter at a depth of 15 to 23 centimeters (6 to 9 inches).\nThe dry color of the A horizon is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, or 7.5YR 5/2. Moist color values are usually 1 to 2 units lower. It is usually sandy clay loam, but in some pedons it is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay. This horizon is calcareous throughout.\nThe dry color of the B horizon is 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/4, 5/3, 5/1; 7.5YR 7/4, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2; 5Y 7/4, 7/3, 6/4, 6/3, 5/6, 5/4, or 5/2. Moist color values are 1 to 2 units lower.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay. Lime appears as few to common fine filaments, soft masses, and as coatings on faces of peds. The percent clay in the B2 horizon is less than 1.2 times the percent in the A horizon. Depth to segregated lime ranges from 25 to 48 centimeters (10 to 19 inches).\nThe dry color of the C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/6, 6/4, 7/6, 7/4, 8/4; 7.5YR 7/8, 7/6, 7/4, 6/6, 6/4; or 5Y 6/4. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.  Lime is usually in the form of common fine filaments and medium irregular soft masses, and is disseminated in the lower part. In some pedons the entire C horizon will contain only disseminated lime."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Exclose, Panoza, Paver and Vernalis series. Exclose soils do not have a Bt horizon or hues of 7.5YR. Panoza soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to bedrock.  Paver soils do not have lime above 50 centimeters (20 inches) in the profile. Vernalis soils lack lime to a depth of 50 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches) and segregated lime occurs at depths of 76 to 112 centimeters (30 to 44 inches). (see remarks)"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chanac soils are on old stream terraces with slopes of 2 to 50 percent. (see remarks) They formed from mixed alluvium of middle or lower Pliocene nonmarine origin. Elevations are 175 to 610 meters (575 to 2,000 feet). The climate is semiarid mesothermal having hot dry summers, and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 229 to 305 millimeters (9 to 12 inches).  Average January temperature is about 4 degrees C (39 degrees F), average July temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), mean annual temperature is 14 to 20 degrees C (58  to 68 degrees F). Freeze-free season is\n200 175 to 275 days."
