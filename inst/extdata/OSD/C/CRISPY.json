    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Pinew soils have rock fragments which are volcanic rocks and have paralithic materials of weathered tuff or andesite in the series control section.  Pinwheeler soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon and have paralithic materials of weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section.  Trailamp soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm, have paralithic materials of siltstone or shale, and are intermittently moist due to summer convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crispy soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks such as schist or gneiss.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,110 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
