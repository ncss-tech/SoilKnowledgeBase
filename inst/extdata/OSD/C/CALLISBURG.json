  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 60 to more than\n100 inches thick.  Fine pebbles of ironstone and quartz range from none to about 5 percent by volume throughout the solum.  Black concretions range from none to common throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and\nchroma of 2 to 8.  A thin A2 horizon 2 to 6 inches thick and one\nor two units of value higher than the A1 or Ap horizon occurs in\nsome pedons.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe B21t has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of\n3 to 6.  The B22t and B23t horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y,\nvalue of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Few to common mottles in colors and shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray occur in the Bt horizon mainly in the lower part of most pedons.  The gray mottles are believed to be inherited from the parent materials.  The B21t\nis sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay and is strongly acid to neutral.  The B22t and B23t horizons are sandy clay or\nclay.  The average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction of the lower part of the\nB2t ranges from strongly acid through neutral.  Few to common uncoated sand grains on faces of peds and few pockets of uncoated sand grains occur in the lower Bt.\nThe B3 horizon has the same colors as the Bt or is mottled.\nReaction ranges from strongly acid through mildly alkaline.  Some pedons contain soft carbonates, generally below depths of 50\ninches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chigley, Hamby, Minwells, Pedernales, Truce, Voca, Windthorst and Winters series in the same family and the similar Bastrop, Chaney, Miles, Payne, Rader, and Travis series.  Chigley soils have more than 10 percent coarse fragments in the Bt and have redder hues.  Hamby and Minwells\nsoils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon and, in\naddition, Minwells soils have a gravelly substratum.  Pedernales\nand Winters soils have Cca horizons.  Truce, Voca, and Windthorst soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Bastrop and Miles\nsoils have fine-loamy control sections.  Chaney soils contain\nmottles due to wetness within a depth of 30 inches.  Payne soils\nhave montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Rader soils have a B&A horizon\nand have mottles due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface.  Travis soils have base saturation of less than 75 percent in the\nBt horizon."

Crockett soils have vertic properties and are on similar landscapes.  Casil and Konsil soils are on low ridges and have fine-loamy control section."
