Crackedground soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Nutzan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Wildcatbutte soils have soil reaction of neutral or slightly alkaline throughout the epipedon and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 60 to 100 cm from the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cavin soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions with dominantly south-facing aspects.  They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from volcanic and pyroclastic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,460 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
