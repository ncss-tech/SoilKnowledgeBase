  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from volcanic and pyroclastic rocks.  Cavin soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
