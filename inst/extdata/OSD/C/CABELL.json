  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabell series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on sideslopes of moraines. Cabell soils formed in volcanic ash overlying till from mixed rocks, dominantly of soft tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature about 38 degrees F.",
