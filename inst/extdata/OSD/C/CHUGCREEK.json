  "OVERVIEW": "The Chugcreek series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to hard igneous bedrock.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from granite and gneiss.  Chugcreek soils are on gently sloping to steep foothills and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
