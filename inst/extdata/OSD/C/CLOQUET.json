  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RRL-MPD-MBW",
  "REVDATE": "02/2009",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cloquet series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in a mantle of loamy eolian or glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying gravelly outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters.",
