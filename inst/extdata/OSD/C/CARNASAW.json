Where the A1 horizon is less than 6 inches thick, it includes hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 3. Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, stony loam, stony silt loam, stony fine sandy loam, bouldery loam, bouldery silt loam, boundery fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, cherty silt loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam.  Content of fragments of shale, sandstone, and quartzite range from 2 to 35 percent by volume.  About 2 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 25 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid, unless it has been limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture, reaction, and content of fragments of shale, sandstone, and quartzite are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Content of fragments of shale, sandstone, and quartzite range from 2 to 15 percent by volume.  About 2 to 10 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 5 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red, or yellow. The Bt2 horizon is clay or silty clay.  Content of fragments of shale, sandstone, and quartzite is similar to the Bt1 horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Some pedons are coarsely mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown, or red.  The Bt3 horizon is gravelly clay, gravelly silty clay,  silty clay, or clay.   Content of fragments of shale or sandstone range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  About 5 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 5 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  The lower boundary is irregular, with extensions 1/2 inch to 4 inches wide into the underlying shale and sandstone at random intervals of 4 feet or less.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon is brownish, grayish, or olive shale interbedded with thin layers of sandstone.  The shale is non-paralithic shale with rock-like structure.  Fractures are less than 10 cm apart, the B.D. is high enough to be root restrictive.  This material has low to moderate excavation difficulty and slakes in water within 15 hours.  The shale is interbedded with sandstone tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal."

Albertville soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or redder. Bengal, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Galilee, Sweatman, Townley, and Vance soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Brockroad soils contain fragments dominated by ferruginous quartzite and have 2Bt horizons.  Cullen and Masada soils contain fragments dominated by gneiss, schist, and/or granite.  Enders, Endsaw, Kirvin, Luverne, and McQueen soils lack the irregular boundary and irregular extension of the Bt3 horizon into the tilted underlying rock.  In addition,  Kirvin, Luverne, and McQueen soils have flakes of mica in the argillic horizon. Fluvanna soils occur in areas receiving less than 42 inches annual rainfall.  Nason soils have saprolite in the substratum.  Remlap and Williamsville soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Appomattox, Badin, Bonwier, Catharpin, Mattaponi, Mayodan, Totier, Urland, and Uwharrie occur in other MLRA's."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carnasaw soils are on nearly level to very steep sideslopes of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges.   Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 56 inches with the highest amount being distributed in January to May.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64."

Bengal, Panama, Sherwood, Sobol, Tuskahoma, and Zafra soils are below Carnasaw soils on nearby landscapes.  Clebit soils are less than 20 inches thick to lithic sandstone and are on ridgecrests. Denman soils have fine-loamy control sections and are on sideslopes.  Panama and Zafra soils have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Pirum and Sherwood soils have fine-loamy control sections and Pirum is on similar landscapes.  Sobol and Tuskahoma soils have fine control sections.  Stapp soils are on adjacent landscapes."
