  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft conglomerate or tuffaceous sandstone ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 6 to 18 percent clay and more than 60 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 61 to 65 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in most years.  They are moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and slightly calcareous or moderately calcareous.  Rock fragments are dominantly pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.  Rock fragments are dominantly pebbles."

Redcan soils have hue of 2.5YR or 10R throughout the profile.  The Emigration, Promo and Solak soils have lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  In addition, the Promo and Solak soils border an aridic soil moisture regime and the Promo soils are mesic.  Puett soils are mesic and average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from tuffaceous sandstone and conglomerate.  Elevations range from 5,300 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 13 to 16 inches.  Freeze-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Brobett, Dahar and Raftriver soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are on gently sloping\nto moderately steep hillsides and summits.  Plegomir soils are shallow to a duripan, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and are on gently sloping fan terraces.  Vicking soils are very deep, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are on alluvial fans and hillsides."
