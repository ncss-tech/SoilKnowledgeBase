  "OVERVIEW": "The Cachebutte series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over glacial outwash. Cachebutte soils are on kames and terraces and in glacial drainage channels on glaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 28 inches thick. The upper 15 to 27 inches of the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 0 to 10 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 30 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 3 to 10 percent. The lower part of the particle-size control section to 40 inches has less than 20 percent volcanic glass, 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 1 to 5 percent clay. Depth to sandy-skeletal outwash is 25 to 35 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates is 24 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. Textures are ashy loam or ashy sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Textures are ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2Bk1 horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 dry. Textures are very gravelly fine sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.
