    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 28 inches thick. The upper 15 to 27 inches of the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 0 to 10 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 30 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 3 to 10 percent. The lower part of the particle-size control section to 40 inches has less than 20 percent volcanic glass, 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 1 to 5 percent clay. Depth to sandy-skeletal outwash is 25 to 35 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates is 24 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. Textures are ashy loam or ashy sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Textures are ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2Bk1 horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 dry. Textures are very gravelly fine sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk2 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry 2 or 3 moist and a chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Textures are gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand and extremely cobbly sand. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cachebutte soils are on kames and terraces and in outwash channels on glaciated plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over glacial outwash. Elevations are 1,400 to 3,200 feet. The semi-arid climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 70 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

Nemire soils are in outwash channels, glaciolacustrine bottoms, swales, and sideslopes of kames and terraces and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Siweeka soils are on till plains on basalt plateaus and are moderately deep to cemented duripan."
