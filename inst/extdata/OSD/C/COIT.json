Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal water table at 46 to 61 cm during the March to June, and is lowest during summer and fall months when it may drop to a depth of 150 to 180 cm.  Some areas have been partially drained by entrenchment of stream channels.  Overflow commonly occurs on an average of 1 in every 4 to 5 years for brief periods between February and May."

The requirement assumed to be met for aquolls is a positive reaction to alpha-alpha-dipyridyl between 40 and 50 cm.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
