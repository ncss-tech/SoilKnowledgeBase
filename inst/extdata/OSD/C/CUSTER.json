RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The control section averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  Some pedons have a loamy sand or fine sandy loam A2 horizon 1/2 to 2 inches thick.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR in the matrix and 7.5YR or 5YR in the ortstein concretions and mottles, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is loamy fine sand to sand.  This horizon has 50 to 80 percent ortstein as rounded concretions, irregularly shaped accretions, and nearly continuous bands of slag-like, irregularly shaped indurated plates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 0 through 4 moist and dry.  It ranges from coarse sand to fine sand and gravelly equivalents of each."
