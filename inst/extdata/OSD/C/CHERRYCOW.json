These soils formed in residuum, slope alluvium, and alluvium from rhyolite, andesite, basalt, welded tuff, and felsic volcanic breccia. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches (406 to 508 mm) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F (14 to 16.7 degrees C). The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
