  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavanaugh series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolite and rhyolitic tuff.  Cavanaugh soils are on side slopes of hills.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
