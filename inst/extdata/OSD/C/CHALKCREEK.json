  "OVERVIEW": "The Chalkcreek series consists of deep, well drained soils on terraces, footslopes, and alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium derived dominantly from tuffaceous siltstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Very fine sand ranges from 30 to 45 percent and contains a high percentage of glass shards.  Rock fragments are absent except for an isolated pebble in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It commonly is moderately alkaline but is mildly alkaline in pockets that are noncalcareous in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Carbonates are disseminated with only a few soft pedogenetic accumulations in some pedons."
