  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Very fine sand ranges from 30 to 45 percent and contains a high percentage of glass shards.  Rock fragments are absent except for an isolated pebble in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It commonly is moderately alkaline but is mildly alkaline in pockets that are noncalcareous in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Carbonates are disseminated with only a few soft pedogenetic accumulations in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in alluvium derived dominantly from tuffaceous siltstone.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
