The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the control section for the 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer months.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Thickness of the ash is 40 to 60 inches or more.  The ash deposits overlie a variety of rocks and mixed kinds of alluvium.  The particle-size control section contains over 60 percent vitric material and is estimated to have 5 to 10 percent clay.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter throughout and an estimated phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent, and 15-bar moisture of less than 12 percent based on an air-dried sample. The solum is 10 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 2 through 4 dry. It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."
