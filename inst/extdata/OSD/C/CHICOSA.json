(Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 37 inches.  (2Bk horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  At 20 inches. (2Bk and 2C horizons)\nRemarks:  This soil was determined to have a consistent cambic horizon and lithologic discontinuity, separating this from the Ildefonso series.  In addition, the soil moisture regime was determined to be dominantly aridic-ustic.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
