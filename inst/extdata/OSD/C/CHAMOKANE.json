  "OVERVIEW": "The Chamokane series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium having mixed mineralogy.  Chamokane soils are on bottom land and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Organic carbon decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The upper part of the particle-size control section is loam or fine sandy loam with lenses of clay loam and loamy sand in some pedons.  It has less than 18 percent clay.  The depth to the gravelly sandy IIC horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The A horizon is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist.  It is loam, heavy loam, fine sandy loam and has lenses of clay loam in some pedons.  It has 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe IIC horizon is gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand.  Some pedons have thin lenses of volcanic ash, loam, or sandy loams.  This horizon has 15 to 25 percent pebbles."
