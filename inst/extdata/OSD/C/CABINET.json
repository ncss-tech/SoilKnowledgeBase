  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabinet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified glaciolacustrine sediments with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. These soils are on stream terraces, lake plains and lake terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
