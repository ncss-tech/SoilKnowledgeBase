  "OVERVIEW": "The Cultus series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed ash and pumice over glacial material.  Cultus soils are on glacial moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
