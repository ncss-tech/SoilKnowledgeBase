Goffpeak soils have 35 to 75 percent pumice in the lower part of the particle-size control section and has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent.  Kittleson soils have cambic B horizons, glass content of 50 to 70 percent in the control section, and are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Shroyton soils have cambic B horizons and are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Steiger soils have an ochric epipedon and lack glacial till within 40 to 60 inches.  Sycan soils have redox features below 40 inches, and lack glacial till within 40 to 60 inches."
