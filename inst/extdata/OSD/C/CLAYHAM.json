There are few to many flakes of mica throughout.  Mottles that occur in the B and C horizons are not redoximorphic features.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Eroded areas have an Ap horizon that is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in most pedons.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  It sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, with few to many mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow, or it is mottled in these colors.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam."

Other soils in similar families include the Brantley, Canton Bend, Capshaw, Cowton, Enon, Gundy, Hallsummit, Hampshire, Maben, Magnet, Mecklenburg, Skyuka, Spray, Zion, and Zuber series.  All of these soils except Redsprings have mixed mineralogy.  Redsprings soils formed from weathered glauconitic material, and have iron and glauconitic gravel, mainly in the A horizon."

These soils formed on broad flood plains in a low energy environment where the silt and clay were able to settle out of the slow moving flood waters.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches near the type location."
