There are few to many flakes of\nmica throughout.  Mottles that occur in the B and C horizons\nare not redoximorphic features.  Reaction is very strongly\nacid to moderately acid throughout, except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6,\nand chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or\nloam.  Eroded areas have an Ap horizon that is sandy clay\nloam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5,\nand chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or\nyellow are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in most\npedons.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay,\nor clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7,\nand chroma of 4 to 8.

These soils formed on broad flood plains in\na low energy environment where the silt and clay were able\nto settle out of the slow moving flood waters.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean annual\nprecipitation is about 48 inches near the type location."
