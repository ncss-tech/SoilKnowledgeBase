  "OVERVIEW": "The Cosey series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolite, latite, and dacite.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
