  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Catharpin series are very deep and well drained.  They formed in moderately fine and fine textured overlay material and residuum from gneiss and schist bedrock.  Permeability is moderate.  They are on ridgetops and sideslopes of the uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is above 58 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thicknesses range from about 45 to 90 inches.  Depths to lithologic discontinuity range from 24 to 50 inches.  Depths to paralithic contact range from 5 to 10 feet and depths to lithic contact are estimated to range from 7 to 40 feet or more.  Contents of rock fragments range from 2 to 15 percent in horizons above the lithologic discontinuity.  These consists of rounded and subrounded reddish quartz gravel.  Rock fragments below the discontinuity consist mostly of weathered fragments of schist and angular vein quartz.  These commonly increase in quantity with depth and in some pedons range up to 50 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons.  The sand fractions are dominantly quartz in the horizons above the lithologic discontinuity and dominantly mica in the lower parts of the solum.  Thin or discontinuous stone lines are present at the contact between the Bt and 2Bt horizons in some pedons.  Reactions are strongly acid or very strongly acid in all horizons unless limed.\nThe horizon has hue of lOYR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B and 2 horizons have hue of 2.5YR or lOR, value of 4 or 5, and chromas of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have mottles of high value and chroma.  The B2t and IIB2t horizons are dominantly clay or silty clay.  In some pedons, individual subhorizons are silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The upper Bt horizons are sticky or very sticky.  2B3 horizons are commonly mottled in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Textures are clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam, in the fine earth fraction.  2B horizons contain few to many flakes of mica.\n2C horizons usually are multicolored, strongly weathered saprolite that crushes easily to silt loam, loam, or sandy loam."

Albertville, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Galilee, Sweatman and Townley soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Brockroad, Fluvanna and Nason soils have hues of 5YR or yellower throughout the Bt horizon.  Carnasaw and Enders soils have coarse fragments dominated by shale, siltstone or sandstone.  Cullen soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the solum.  Endsaw soils have sandstone fragments in the upper part of the solum.  Gritney, Luverne, Masada and Vance soils have less than 30 percent silt in the particle size control section.  Kirvin soils have rock fragments dominated by ironstone.  McQueen soils either lack rock fragments or the coarse fragments are dominated by quartz or chert.  Tatum soils have a solum less than 50 inches thick.  Williamsville soils are sandy clay loam, loam or sandy loam in the lower part of the Bt horizon and developed from glauconitic marine sediments."

These soils formed in a mantel of silty and clayey material containing reddish quartz gravel and clayey underlying material commonly weathered from mica schist and gneiss.  Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches."
