    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 to 24 inches. The content of coarse fragments is 2 to 15 percent in the Bt and C horizons and 0 to 10 percent in the A and E horizons. The fragments are mixed in lithology, but limestone, shale, and granite are dominant.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The upper 7 inches have value of more than 5.5 when mixed and dry. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. It has 18 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent sand. It has few through many, faint or distinct clay films on faces of peds. It has some thin coatings of E material on faces of peds in the upper part in some pedons. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bkg, BCkg, CBkg or Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg, BCkg, CBkg or Cg horizon in the Percy till phase has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe Bkg, BCkg, CBkg or Cg horizon in the Des Moines till phase has textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chilgren soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of less than 2 percent on level or nearly level glacial lake plains. They formed primarily in calcareous, loamy, glacial till. A thin mantle of water-sorted sediments overlies the till in some places. These deposits are Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 24 to 28 inches. Frost free days range from 88 to 135 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1,200 to 1,400 feet."

Very poorly drained Cathro and Rifle soils are organic soils on lower lying positions. The moderately well drained Garnes soils are on slightly higher lying positions. The poorly drained Grygla soils are in similar landscape positions and have a sandy mantle. The very poorly drained Hamre and Haug soils have a thin mantle of organic material over glacial till."
