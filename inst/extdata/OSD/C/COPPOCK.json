  "OVERVIEW": "The Coppock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces, foot slopes, and alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.",
