  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges form 6 to more than 10 feet. Depth to the fragipan is 20 to 30 inches. Rock fragments range form 5 to 25 percent in the solum and 30 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments are predominantly granitic gneiss or quartzite and most pedons have less than 20 percent of the rock fragments and fine-earth derived form shales, sandstones or siltstones.\nThe A or Ap horizon have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4 and chromas of 1 through 3. Fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nThe BE and Bt horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 5Y, values of 4 through 7 and chromas of 1 through 8. They are loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam Individual subhorizons range from 20 to 40 percent clay but the textural control section averages 25 to 30 percent. Structure is prismatic or subangular blocky.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 8, and has mottles with 2 or lower chroma. It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It is firm to extremely firm. Structure is very coarse prismatic or subangular blocky of any grade, or weak grade of any other structure size.\nThe C horizon have hues of 7.5YR through 5Y, values of 4 through 7 and chromas of 2 through 8. The C horizon is loam, sandy loam or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Andover series is the only other series in the same family. Andover soils have sola thicker than 40 inches and have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone, siltstone or shale and occur in the Northern Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province. Other series in related families are the Lamington, Mullins, Nolo, Robertsville, Shelmadine, and Tyler, all except Lamington and Nola are silty soils with less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in textural control section. Lamington soils are formed in old sediments derived primarily from red Triassic shale and sandstone can have hues as red as 2.5YR in the sola and are semiactive. Nolo soils lack rock fragments of grantitic gneiss or quartzite, but rather contain fragments weathered mostly from acid sandstone and includes some materials from shale and siltstone. Shelmadine soils formed in pre-Wisconsin age glacial till and have less sand and more silt in the particle-size control section. Mullins soils formed in old alluvium and residuum from acid siltstone, sandstone, and shale and are fine-silty. Robertsville formed in old, mixed alluvium or colluvium on stream terraces and concave upland areas and are fine-silty. Tyler soils are somewhat poorly drained and formed in silty alluvium and in a mantle of loess on high Illinoian age terraces and valley fills and have an Aeric subgroup."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cokesbury soils are on 0 to 8 percent concave footslope and toeslope positions of headslopes, in upland depressions or along waterways and bands that extend along the base of steeper slopes. They are formed either in old till or on driftless landscapes in colluvium from primarily granitic gneiss or other acid crystalline rocks. Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. and average annual precipitation from 40 to 48 inches. Frost free period ranges form 160 to 190 days."

In addition, Edneyville, Gladstone and Parker soils lack a fragipan. Also, Parker soils lack an argillic horizon. Califon soils lack mottles of low chroma near the surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Morris County, New Jersey and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. In addition, horizon nomenclature in the typical pedon and the range in characteristics section were revised.\nThe 2/2008 revision includes competing series and other sections on the OSD were revised, updates this soil to the 10th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Revisions to geographic setting to include adjacent driftless uplands of the Northern Piedmont.  Minor revisions to nomenclature within the description were done. This pedon has been entered into NASIS and has pedon ID# 86NJ027001.\nPrevious revision dates: 3/86--CFE, CFJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
