  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Creva series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Creva soils are on hills. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
