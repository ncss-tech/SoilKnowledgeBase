The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. (50 to 54 degrees F.)  Depth to the lithic contact is 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches).  The particle size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Hue throughout the profile is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 20 to 35 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel.  It is clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon has moderate subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.  It has 40 to 50 percent clay with 0 to 15 percent stones, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt or tuff.  Elevations are 762 to 1219 meters (2,500 to 4,000 feet).  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 254 to 406 millimeters (10 to 16 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C. (48 to 52 degrees F).  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

Elderflat soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact, clayey, and are found in broad, gently sloping swales or concave topography between areas of mound-intermounds."
