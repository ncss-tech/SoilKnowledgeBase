  "OVERVIEW": "The Coelho series consists of very shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or welded tuff.  Coelho are on basalt plateaus or benches.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 centimeters (16 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)",

The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. (50 to 54 degrees F.)  Depth to the lithic contact is 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches).  The particle size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Hue throughout the profile is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 20 to 35 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel.  It is clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon has moderate subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.  It has 40 to 50 percent clay with 0 to 15 percent stones, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel."
