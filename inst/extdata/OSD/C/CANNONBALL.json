  "OVERVIEW": "The Cannonball series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Cannonball soils are on nearly level to steep slopes of dissected marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
