    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the stratified silty, loamy, and sandy 2C horizon range from 40 to 60 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments typically are absent but volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the stratified loamy and sandy material.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from extremely acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the sandy substratum and from strongly acid to neutral in the loamy substratum.  Redox accumulations are below 20 inches, but within 40 inches.  Redox depletions occur below 30 inches in some pedons.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap is loamy sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe Bw or BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Bw or BC horizons with spodic color have pH of 6.0 or more or have organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand with thin strata of very fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of  2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is typically stratified very fine sandy loam and silt loam with thin strata of fine and very fine sand, but includes strata with coarser or finer texture."

Croswell and Halfaday soils are sandy throughout the series control section.  Croswood soils are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have more than 5 percent rock fragments there. Gilchrist and Heintz soils have free carbonates within 40 inches.  Manitowish soils have a 10 to 20 inch thick loamy mantle in the upper part of the series control section. Mattix soils have a loamy mantle 5 to 15 inches thick. have and have free carbonates within 25 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cublake soils are on outwash terraces, outwash plains, and glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in deep sandy outwash underlain by stratified silty, loamy, and sandy glaciofluvial deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 1,900 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils, the moderately well drained Croswell soils, and the excessively drained Rubicon and Vilas soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the soil is sandy throughout.  Croswood soils are nearby on outwash veneered areas of moraines and drumlins where there is loamy glacial till at 40 to 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Flink soils and the well drained Sultz soils form a drainage sequence with Cublake soils."

Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the stratified lacustrine deposits.  This soil has a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most area are used for woodland.  Mature forests are mostly red maple, northern red oak, paper birch, yellow birch, hemlock, eastern white pine, and red pine but balsam fir and quaking aspen are in most stands.  Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland.  Corn, small grain, and hay are the main crops.  Some areas formerly used as cropland are now idle or planted to pine trees."
