  "OVERVIEW": "The Cadrina series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Cadrina soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
