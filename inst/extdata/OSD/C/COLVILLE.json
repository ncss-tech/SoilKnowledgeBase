  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Colville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. Colville soils are on floodplains, stream terraces, and in depressions and in drainageways of perennial streams. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 29 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.
