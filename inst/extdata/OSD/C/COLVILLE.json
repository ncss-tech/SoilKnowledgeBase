  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colville soils are on bottom lands along streams and drainage ways. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived principally from argillite, schist, gneiss, granite, limestone, and dolomite. Elevations are 1,400 to 2,400 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 29 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."
