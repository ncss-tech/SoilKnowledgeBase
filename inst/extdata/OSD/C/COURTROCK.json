The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. Depth to very gravelly sand ranges from 40 inches to over 5 feet.  The particle-size control section is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and has 10 to 18 percent clay and over 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the upper part and 20 to 35 in the lower part of the control section.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 44 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak platy, granular or subangular blocky structure.

It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has color similar to the A horizon.  It has less than one percent organic matter.  It is coarse sandy loam or loam.  It has 8 to 15 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

Blue Star soils have weakly to strongly cemented horizons of lime accumulation at depths of 15 to 30 inches.  Farrell soils have 0 to 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Tickason soils have a calcic horizon.  Tonasket soils have silt loam control sections, have less than 10 percent rock fragments and are underlain by laminated sediments.  Malott soils have a duripan at 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Courtrock soils are on alluvial fans at elevations of 1,700 to 6,300 feet.  Elevations above 3,400 feet are in Utah.  The slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse and medium textured alluvium of mixed origin including pumice and ash.  Courtrock soils occur in a semiarid climate with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  The average July temperature is 70 degrees F., the average January temperature is 32 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."
