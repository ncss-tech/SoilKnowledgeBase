The soils formed in moderately coarse and medium textured alluvium of mixed origin including pumice and ash.  Courtrock soils occur in a semiarid climate with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  The average July temperature is 70 degrees F., the average January temperature is 32 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.
