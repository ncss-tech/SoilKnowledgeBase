  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mineral solum is less than 50 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. The rock fragments consist mainly of schist, slate, phyllite, granite, quartzite, shale, or limestone. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A and B horizons, and moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon. Carbonates are present in some pedons below a depth of 100 cm.\nThe O horizons, where present, consist of peat, mucky peat, and/or muck.\nThe A horizon, or Ap horizon where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have ABg horizons up to 18cm thick.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or 5GY, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cdg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or 5GY, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. The Cdg horizon has plates of geogenic origin or is massive. It is firm to extremely firm. Some pedons have a Cd horizon with dominant chroma higher than 2."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Brayton, Monarda, Pillsbury, and Ridgebury soils are in related families. Brayton, Monarda, Pillsbury, and Ridgebury soils have dominant chroma higher than 2 in a subhorizon of the B or BC horizon within a depth of 75 cm. Ridgebury soils also have a mesic soil temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabot soils are on nearly level to moderately steep slopes on hills and mountains. They are on concave backslopes and footslopes, on toeslopes, and in depressions and drainageways. Less frequently, Cabot soils occur on broad till plains. The soils formed in loamy lodgment till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from schistose rocks and impure limestone. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Tree-tip pit and mound topography is common in unplowed areas. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost free period is 70 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from about 100 to 650 meters above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brayton, Buckland, Colonel, Marlow, Peacham, Peru, Sunapee, Tunbridge, and Vershire soils. Brayton soils are in positions similar to Cabot soils and have a higher dominant chroma in the B or BC horizon. Buckland and Vershire soils typically occur in areas where the underlying bedrock contains impure limestone. They are better drained and are on convex slopes above the nearby Cabot soils. Colonel, Marlow, Peru, Sunapee, and Tunbridge soils typically occur in areas where the underlying bedrock is schist, gneiss, or granite. They are better drained and are on convex slopes above the nearby Cabot soils. Peacham soils are very poorly drained and occur throughout the extent of Cabot soils."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded. The common trees are red spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, tamarack, hemlock, white cedar, white pine, red maple, sugar maple, yellow birch, paper birch, and elm. Some areas have been cleared and are primarily used for hay and pasture. A few cleared areas are used for cultivated crops."
