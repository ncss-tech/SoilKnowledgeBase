  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days in the four month period following the summer solstice.  The soil cracks open and closes once each year in the summer.  It remains open for 80 consecutive days or more in most years.  Slickensides are close enough to intersect in all or some part between 10 and 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 or more inches.  The textural control section is 60 to 70 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Soft lime masses are below a depth of 20 inches. Above a depth of 40 inches the chroma is 2 or 3 in some subhorizon.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1.5 or less moist and dry.\nThe B horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1.5 or less moist and dry above 30 inches.  Value ranges to 4 or 5 moist and dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry below 30 inches."

Bashaw soils have chroma of 1 or less to a depth of 40 inches, lack secondary carbonates in the particle-size control section, are dry for 45 to 90 consecutive days, and are poorly drained.  Natroy soils have distinct to prominent redox concentrations throughout the solum, lack secondary carbonates within the particle-size control section, and are poorly drained.  Padigan soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days and are poorly drained."
