  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a lithic contact range from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually dry, but are moist in the winter and for 1/4 the time the soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F. in the spring and late fall.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The upper part of the solum is noncalcareous and range is pH from 6.6 in the A1 horizon to 7.9 in the B2t horizon.  The lower part of the solum is calcareous and contains coarse lime segregations, mainly on the exterior of peds, and pH values range from 7.6 to 8.4.  Depth to the lime accumulations ranges from 15 to 28 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 through 4 moist.  It has weak or moderate, thin or medium platy or granular structure or is massive.  The A2 horizon has hue dominantly of 10YR, but of 7.5YR in some pedons, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The epipedon has value higher than 5.5 dry, 3.5 moist, or chroma greater than 3 moist, or the horizon is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  It has strong, medium or coarse columnar structure in the upper part and moderate or strong, medium or coarse prismatic or subangular blcoky structure in the lower part.  This horizon is dominantly heavy clay and averages 60 or 75 percent clay.  The B3tca horizon is in all pedons except those that are less than 26 inches to bedrock.\nThe bedrock is unweathered except for the surface 1/4 to 1/2 inch in some pedons.  Segregated lime is common along the lithic contact and in cracks and vesicules within the bedrock."

Fertaline soils have indurated duripans and have less than 60 percent clay in their B2t horizons.  Borda soils have mean annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F., less than 60 percent clay, less than 15 percent sodium in their B2t horizons, and lack columnar structure.  Millerlux soils have a lithic contact at depths of 12 to 20 inches.  Termo soils have B2t horizons with less than 60 percent clay, and lack bedrock within 40 inches.  Toney soils have less than 60 percent clay in their B2t horizons."

They formed in loamy residuum weathered from tuff with minor admixture of basalt.  The climate is cool, continental, with an annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F."
