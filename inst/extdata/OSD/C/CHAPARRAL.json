  "OVERVIEW": "The Chaparral series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in gravelly alluvium. These gently sloping soils are on alluvial fans and erosional remnants of fan piedmonts. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
