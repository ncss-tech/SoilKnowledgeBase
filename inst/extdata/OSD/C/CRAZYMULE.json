Slope is 5 to 35 percent. Elevation is 6,219 to 12,536 feet (1,895.7 to 3,821.1 meters). These soils formed in colluvium, residuum, or till from granitoid rock. The climate is Mediterranean with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 31 to 65 inches (787 to 1,651 millimeters). Mean annual temperature is 34 to 50 degrees F (1.1 to 10.0 degrees C). Frost-free period is 15 to 45 days."
