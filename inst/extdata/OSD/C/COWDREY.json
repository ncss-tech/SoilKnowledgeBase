  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowdrey series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in thick, fine textured noncalcareous glacial till or slope alluvium derived principally from clay shale.  Cowdrey soils are on hillsides and ridge crests in mountainous areas. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. with an O horizon at least 4 inches thick and in areas of timber with a good crown cover. Typically these soils are noncalcareous to a depth of more than 60 inches but are calcareous between 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  The solum to the base of the Bt is 20 to 50 inches thick.  Organic carbon content ranges from .8 to 2 percent in the surface horizons and decreases uniformly with depth.  Exchangeable sodium percentage is usually less than 1 but in some pedons it is up to 15 percent in some subhorizon of the solum less than 4 inches thick.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated. Cation exchange capabity ranges from about 70 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  The major part of the solum has 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments, mainly gravel and cobble, while the C horizon has 35 to 60 percent gravel and channers with some cobble below 40 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically has platy structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard and slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It typically has angular blocky structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is light clay or heavy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand, with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Oriented clay films occur in some part of this horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Gravelly modifiers are common.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or light clay but the horizon contains more than 35 percent clay to depths of 40 inches.  Sandy clay loams may occur below depths of 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."

The soil formed in thick, fine textured noncalcareous glacial till or slope alluvium derived principally from clay shale.  They are also formed in colluvial material derived from volcanic rocks. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 44 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 7,800 to 9,300 feet at the type location and ranges to 11,800 feet in southern latitudes in the state.   Frost-free period is 20 to 30 days."
