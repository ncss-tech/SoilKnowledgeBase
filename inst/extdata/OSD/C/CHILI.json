  "OVERVIEW": "The Chili series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains, terraces, kames, and beach ridges. They formed in Wisconsinan age outwash deposits, mainly of non-calcareous sandstone and shale with a large amount of quartz gravel. Commonly, the outwash is mantled with silt. Permeability is moderately rapid in the subsoil and rapid in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 0 to 18 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 35 to 54 inches. Rock fragment lithology is mainly sandstone and shale, with a large amount of quartz gravel. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 unrubbed (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, gravelly loam, and sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid, but limed areas range to neutral. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.\nWhere present, the BE, BA, or E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. They have textures and reaction similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Some subhorizons have a hue of 5YR. It is sandy loam, silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly analogues; and very gravelly analogues of sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam below 20 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 60 percent in individual horizons. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and their gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Some pedons have textures of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. Rock fragment content averages between 15 and 60 percent.\nThe BC horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is gravelly or very gravelly analogues of loamy sand or sand. Many pedons have thin layers of gravel. Rock fragment content averages between 25 and 60 percent. Individual strata may contain less than 15 percent rock fragments. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral, and ranges to slightly alkaline below 60 inches."

The Amanda, Greybrook, Hickory, Martinsville, Princeton, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, and Wawasee soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Belmont, Kosciusko, Leroy, and Relay soils have thinner sola.  The Cliftycreek soils are deeper than 54 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. The Lumberton soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. The Belmore, Kidder, and Ockley soils are slightly or moderately alkaline in the lower part of the series control section. The Crouse and Wawaka soils have sola more than 80 inches thick. The Gallman soils have rock fragments predominated by shale with some crystalline and limestone fragments. High Gap, Military, Pignut, and Woodbine soils are less than 60 inches to a lithic contact. Kanawha soils have less sand in the lower solum. Turnersburg soils have a higher mean annual temperature."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chili soils are on outwash plains, terraces, kames, and beach ridges. The soils formed in Wisconsinan age stratified outwash derived largely from noncalcareous sandstone and shale that contains a high amount of quartz gravel. Commonly, the outwash is mantled with silt. The slope gradient typically is 0 to 18 percent, but the range is up to 70 percent. In some places the upper part of the solum formed in silty alluvium or loess as much as 18 inches in thickness. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 54 degrees F."
