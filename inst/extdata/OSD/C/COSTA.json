  "OVERVIEW": "The Costa series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on ridge tops, summits and side slopes of the limestone hills of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.",
