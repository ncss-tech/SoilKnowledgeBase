Content of rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft semi-consolidated and consolidated fractured limestone.
