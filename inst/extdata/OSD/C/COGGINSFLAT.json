  "OVERVIEW": "The Cogginsflat series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from tuff, consolidated volcanic sediments, or old marine sediments with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Cogginsflat soils are on low hills, old terraces, and benches and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 7 to 20 inches. Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 30 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy sandy loam or ashy loam. It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy sandy clay loam, sandy clay loam, ashy clay loam, or clay loam and contains 5 to 20 percent gravel and 18 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bq horizon if present has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and a value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is sandy loam or loam and contains 5 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent clay.\nThe duripan is very weakly to strongly cemented (haplic subgroup) gravels and sand to a depth of 40 inches or more. The duripan overlies paralithic sedimentary strata."

They are found in complex with Mascall soils on low hills.  Choptie soils are on adjacent hillslopes. They are 12 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Roschene soils are on adjacent stream terraces. They are over 60 inches deep and are moderately well drained. Powellbutte and Booth soils are on adjacent plateaus. Powellbutte soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact and are vitrandic. Booth soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact with over 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."
