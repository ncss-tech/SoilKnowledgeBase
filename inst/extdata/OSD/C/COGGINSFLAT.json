    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 70 to 90 days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 7 to 20 inches. Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 30 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy sandy loam or ashy loam. It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy sandy clay loam, sandy clay loam, ashy clay loam, or clay loam and contains 5 to 20 percent gravel and 18 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bq horizon if present has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and a value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is sandy loam or loam and contains 5 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent clay.\nThe duripan is very weakly to strongly cemented (haplic subgroup) gravels and sand to a depth of 40 inches or more. The duripan overlies paralithic sedimentary strata."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cogginsflat soils are on low hills at elevations of 3,500 to 4,500 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fopiano, Choptie, Roschene, Powellbutte, and Booth soils. Fopiano soils are clayey and 10 to 20 inches to paralithic contact. They are found in complex with Mascall soils on low hills.  Choptie soils are on adjacent hillslopes. They are 12 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Roschene soils are on adjacent stream terraces. They are over 60 inches deep and are moderately well drained. Powellbutte and Booth soils are on adjacent plateaus. Powellbutte soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact and are vitrandic. Booth soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact with over 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."
