  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 80 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, or N/, value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or less. Redox concentrations in shades of brown or yellow range from none to few.  Most pedons have an A/Eg horizon with common medium or coarse prominent redox depletions in hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Organic matter ranges from 1.5 to 6 percent in the upper part.  The base saturation ranges from 10 to 49 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or N/, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 2 or less.  Redox concentrations range from none to common in shades of brown or yellow.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Rutlege series (SC) is in the same family.  Soils in similar families include Henco, Leagueville, Melhomes, Placid and Uhland series.  Rutlege soils have 10 to 20 percent organic matter in the upper part of the A horizon.  Henco, Leagueville, and Melhomes soils do not have an umbric epipedon. Placid soils are in the hyperthermic temperature regime.  Uhland soils are moderately well drained and have a coarse-loamy control section."

The soils formed in sandy materials of Tertiary Age in the Carizzo, Queen City and Sparta sand formations of the Claiborne Geology Group.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 68 degrees F.; frost free days range from 265 to 280; elevation ranges from 300 to 650 feet above sea level; and the thronthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 56 to 68."

Arenosa, Dutek, Padina, and Silstid soils are on adjacent higher well drained landscape positions.  Robco soils are on adjacent slightly higher landscape positions.  Uhland soils are on slightly lower flood plain positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Cadelake soils are poorly drained and rapidly permeable.  Runoff is negligible.  A water table is at or near the surface throughout most of the year except during prolonged droughty conditions.  These soils pond water for very brief to brief durations during wet periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in rangeland or native pasture.  Native vegetation consists of scattered water oak, black willow and sweetgum trees.  The understory consists of maiden cane, waxmyrtle, blackberry, carpetgrass, vaseygrass, dollarwart, sedges and other water tolerant shrubs.  Yaupon has encroached in some areas."
