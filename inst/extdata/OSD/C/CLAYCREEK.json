Pageland and Spiro soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Rexor soils formed in alluvium on flood plains and do not have mottles of chroma of 2 of less above a depth of 36 inches.  Creedmoor soils have a clayey particle-size control section and are Ultisols.  White Store soils have a fine particle-size control section."
