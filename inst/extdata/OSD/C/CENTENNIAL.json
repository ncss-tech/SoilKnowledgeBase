    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to petrocalcic is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from about December 1 to March 1 and is below 41 degrees F. from about January 1 to February 1.  The soil between the depths of 11 and 22 inches is dry throughout for 210 days to 235 days from about May 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 40 to 60 days from about January 15 to March 15 and is moist in some or all parts for 40 to 60 consecutive days from about March 1 to May 1 when the soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F.  The surface is covered with 10 to 15 percent subangular and subrounded (2 to 50 mm) gravel.  It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated carbonates throughout.  Electrial conductivity is 2 to 8 dS/m throughout.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon color is 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, or 7/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, or 5/3.  It averages 3 to 6 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent fine and coarse (2 to 50 mm) gravel.\nThe Btk1 horizon color is 2.5Y 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 6/4, 7/3 or 7/4.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand or sandy loam averaging 3 to 10 percent clay.  It has 5 to 30 percent coarse fragments with 5 to 30 percent (2 to 75 mm) gravel and 0 to 5 percent (75 to 150 mm) cobbles.  Carbonates are segregated as soft masses or concretions.\nThe Btk2 horizon color is 2.5Y 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 6/4, 7/3 or 7/4.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4.  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or cobbly sandy loam averaging 10 to 18 percent clay.  It has 5 to 30 percent coarse fragments with 5 to 25 percent (2 to 75 mm) gravel and 0 to 10 percent (75 to 150 mm) cobbles.  Carbonates are segregated as soft masses or concretions.\nThe 2Bkm horizon color is N8/0; 2.5Y 6/4, 7/2, 7/4, 8/2; 10YR 6/4, 7/2, 7/4, 8/1, or 8/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4, 8/2; 10YR 5/4, 6/4, 8/1, or 8/2.  It is commonly fractured with a few roots extending down fractures, but in some pedons it is not fractured or has been recemented.  Indurated laminar layers make up about 50 to 90 percent of the volume of the upper horizon.  Weakly to strongly cemented loamy sand and sand make up the lower part."

The soils formed in alluvium weathered from mixed sources including lacustrine deposits of indurated calcareous sandstone, siltstone, limestone and reworked tuffaceous sediments.  Elevations are 3,800 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 6 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F.; mean annual temperatures is 57 to 61 degrees F.  Frost free season is 215 to 235 days."
