These soils formed on slope alluvium, alluvium, and residuum derived from Mancos Shale. Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches with a uniform precipitation pattern with a slight decrease in May and June, and slight increase in July and August. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. The frost-free period is 135 to 160 days."
