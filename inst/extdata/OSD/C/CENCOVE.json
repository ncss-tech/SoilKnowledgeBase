  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 66 degrees to 74 degrees F. These soils are usually dry, but are moist between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days in later winter and spring. The organic matter content is low or moderately low and decreases regularly with depth. A layer of sand and gravel is at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Some pedons have a few scattered pebbles distributed throughout. Below the A horizon and above the sand and gravel, the soil is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, and averages 6 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent but less than 50 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. In many pedons, a thin layer of loamy fine sand or loamy sand is between the sandy loam and the gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Value of rubbed soils are lighter than 5.5 dry and 2.5 moist.\nThe Cca horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry."

Emerson and Lolalita soils are noncalcareous to depths of 2 feet or deeper. Heist soils have 7.5YR hue, are strongly calcareous, have weakly lime-cemented horizons, and lack loose sand and gravel above depth of 40 inches. Marsing soils have loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or gravelly loam above the sand and gravel. Myton soils have strongly calcareous loam Cca and weakly lime-cemented horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cencove soils are on level to sloping alluvial fans and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent but are predominantly less than 4 percent. Elevations range from 2,000 to 4,500 feet. The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived mostly from quartzitic, granitic, rhyolitic, basaltic, and Idaho-Payette formation materials. The climate is semiarid, continental with dry summers.  Average frost-free period is 110 to 170 days, mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches, including 0.5 to 2 feet of snow."

Sagehill and Truesdale soils are coarse-loamy and lack contrasting textures."
