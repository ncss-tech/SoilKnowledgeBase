Cavespring soils have a ratio of summer to winter evapotranspiration of about 0.4 to 1, typical of the central Mojave desert, and have neutral to moderately alkaline soil reaction. Emot soils have more than 50 percent silt in the fine earth fraction and contain 15 to 25 percent clay. Ogral soils have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR throughout its profile and nongravelly A and C1 horizons. Spellacy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Yermo soils have a MAST of 15 to 17 degrees C, gravelly C1 horizons, and have a ratio of summer to winter evapotranspiration of about 0.4 to 1, typical of the central Mojave desert. Storybook soils are derived from alluvium derived from granitic rocks and are have summer moisture."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 765 to 1,375 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot summers, typical of the Mojave desert transitional to Sonoran. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 180 mm mean annual temperature is 17 to 21 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
