  "OVERVIEW": "The Canoto series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Canoto soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans, fan skirts and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C.",

Cavespring soils have a ratio of summer to winter evapotranspiration of about 0.4 to 1, typical of the central Mojave desert, and have neutral to moderately alkaline soil reaction. Emot soils have more than 50 percent silt in the fine earth fraction and contain 15 to 25 percent clay. Ogral soils have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR throughout its profile and nongravelly A and C1 horizons. Spellacy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Yermo soils have a MAST of 15 to 17 degrees C, gravelly C1 horizons, and have a ratio of summer to winter evapotranspiration of about 0.4 to 1, typical of the central Mojave desert. Storybook soils are derived from alluvium derived from granitic rocks and are have summer moisture."
