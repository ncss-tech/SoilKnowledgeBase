    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Childshill soils are on moderately broad, undulating mountain ridges. Slope gradients are 5 to 30 percent. Elevations are 545 to 717 meters (1785 to 2350 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial deposits derived from mix sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 2030 to 2550 millimeters (80 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 240 to 280 days."
