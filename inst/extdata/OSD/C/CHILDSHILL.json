  "OVERVIEW": "The Childshill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial deposits derived from mix sources. Childshill soils are on moderately broad, undulating mountain ridges and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
