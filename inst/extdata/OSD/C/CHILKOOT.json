  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Textures in the 10 to 40 inch control section include sand, very fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, and loamy very fine sand.  Textures are often stratified.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  The water table fluctuates between 0 and 20 inches but is normally within 10 inches of the surface.  In some profiles the watertable has dropped below 20 inches due to altered drainage.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 2 through 5 moist, and chroma from 0 through 3 moist. Texture is silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value from 3 through 6 moist, and chroma from 1 through 4 moist.  Some colors are due to uncoated grains of sand.  Mottles are commonly present, however, where absent, the matrix chroma is 1 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand, with occasional thin strata of very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent, with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble."

The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 55 to over 200 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from sea level to 800 feet."

Funter and Kushneahin soils are organic soils in depressional areas.  Kupreanof and Mosman soils are well drained soils on adjacent mountainslopes.  Lutak soils are also well drained and are on adjacent alluvial terraces and moraines.  Nataga soils occur on alluvial fans and are shallow over extremely gravelly sands."
