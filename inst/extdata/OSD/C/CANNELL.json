Kriest soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the profile and have a thin mantle of volcanic ash on the surface.  Moscow soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 36 inches.  Rogue soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Chaix soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Chawanakee soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 12 to 20 inches and a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 59 degrees F."

They formed in material weathered from Mesozoic granitic rock, principally granodiorite.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches, most of which falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 to 45 degrees F, and the frost-free season is about 75 to 150 days."
