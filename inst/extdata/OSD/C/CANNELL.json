  "OVERVIEW": "The Cannell series consists of deep, well drained soils formed on mountainous uplands in material weathered from granitic rock.  Cannell soils have slopes of 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Base saturation is 50 to 60 percent.  Dark colors do not extend below a depth of 8 inches.\nThe A horizon has color value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam and has weak or moderate subangular blocky to weak or moderate granular structure.\nThe Bw horizon has color value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam and has weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has color value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or in some pedons loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  The Cr material grades into hard granitic rock at varying depths."

They formed in material weathered from Mesozoic granitic rock, principally granodiorite.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches, most of which falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 to 45 degrees F, and the frost-free season is about 75 to 150 days."
