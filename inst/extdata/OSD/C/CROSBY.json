The somewhat poorly drained Fincastle and Pyrmont soils are on similar landforms. Fincastle soils have a thicker layer of loess and Pyrmont soils are shallower than 51 cm (20 inches) to carbonates. The moderately well drained Celina, Lewisburg, Miami, and Williamstown soils and the well drained Losantville and Miamian soils are on higher lying landform positions."

The stony subsoil phase may become a new series as subset soil surveys with this phase are updated during MLRA activities.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon, S1978IN065007, from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
