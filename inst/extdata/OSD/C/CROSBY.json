  "OVERVIEW": "The Crosby series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Crosby soils formed in as much as 56 cm (22 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The stony subsoil phase may become a new series as subset soil surveys with this phase are updated during MLRA activities.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon, S1978IN065007, from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska.
