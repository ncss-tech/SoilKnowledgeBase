  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Angular blue quartz and anorthosite gravel range form 0 to 35 percent in the soil. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the A and Ap horizons, from extremely acid through strongly acid in the Bt horizon, and from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where chroma is less than 4, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The lower part of most pedons is mottled, and colors inherited from saprolite range to neutral, value of 8, and chroma of 0.  The Bt horizon is clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is saprolite that is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Culpeper, Elioak, and Minnieville series in the same family.  Culpeper soils contain rock fragments of arkosic sandstone, quartzite, phyllite, and schist and formed in materials weathered from these rocks.  Elioak soils contain rock fragments of quartz muscovite schist and graywacke sandstone, formed in materials weathered from these rocks, and are moderately permeable.  Minnieville soils contain rock fragments of hornblende gneiss or schist and formed in materials weathered from these rocks."
