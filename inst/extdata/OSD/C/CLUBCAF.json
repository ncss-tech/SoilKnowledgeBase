  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Afton, Catherine, Clementine, Colo, Otter, Sawmill, and Whitewood series are in a closely related family. Afton soils formed in loess and alluvium derived from loess. Catherine and Clementine soils receive less than 25 inches of annual precipitation. Colo soils receive less than 30 inches of annual precipitation. Otter and Sawmill soils formed in alluvium derived from loess and till of Wisconsin age. Whitewood soils contain free carbonates."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Alonzville, Caverns, Coursey, Botetourt, Ingledove, and Shottower soils are well drained and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more coarse fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Combs, and Speedwell soils have mollic epipedons, are better drained, and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils are well drained, contain more clay in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces."

Fluventic features - irregular decrease in organic matter content with \tincreasing depth.\n3.  Aquic moisture regime.\nSoils now within the range of the Clubcaf series were previously correlated as Melvin and Dunning series in published soil surveys.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Ranges for morphology, chemistry, and particle-size distribution are based on 6 pedons from Wythe, Smyth, and Washington Counties, Virginia.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
