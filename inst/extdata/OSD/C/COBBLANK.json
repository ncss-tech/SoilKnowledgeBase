  "OVERVIEW": "The Cobblank series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over loamy glacial till and colluvium underlain by consolidated bedrock.  Cobblank soils occur on hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon or the A part of the A/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  The E part (when present) has value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is mucky silt loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 45 percent and include 15 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobble.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4: chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and include 25 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 40 percent cobble."
