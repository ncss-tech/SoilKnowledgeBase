Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon or the A part of the A/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  The E part (when present) has value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is mucky silt loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 45 percent and include 15 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobble.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4: chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and include 25 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 40 percent cobble."
