GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cottrell soils are on high old alluvial terraces at elevations of 600 to 900 feet. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in mixed old alluvium.  Summers are warm and moist and winters are cool and wet.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 80 inches, mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 140 to 200 days."
