The A and BA horizon is medium acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has distinct mottles with value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 moist within the upper 10 inches.  It is silty clay or clay and averages 40 to 50 percent clay.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chismore, Mayger and Suver series.  Chismore and Mayger soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the argillic horizon and are very strongly acid.  Suver soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have 55 to 70 percent clay in the argillic horizon, have a sola thickness of less than 50 inches, and are somewhat poorly drained. GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cottrell soils are on high old alluvial terraces at elevations of 600 to 900 feet. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in mixed old alluvium.  Summers are warm and moist and winters are cool and wet.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 80 inches, mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 140 to 200 days."
