The solum is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It commonly is loam, but the range includes silt loam and clay loam.\nThe B1 horizon has the same color range as the A horizon. It is clay loam or loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay. It ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick. This horizon has 5 to 10 percent pebbles and cobble fragments in the lower part.\nThe IIB3 horizon is lacking in some pedons. It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5. It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. It contains 0 to 10 percent pebble and cobble fragments. Calcium carbonate content ranges up to 14 percent in the lower part of this horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Charette soils are on nearly level to gently sloping side slopes in basalt flows. The slope gradient commonly is 1 to 5 percent, but the range is 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvial sediments derived dominantly from basalt with modification by eolian material. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,500 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches. The frost-free season is 140 to 160 days."

Capulin soils are on slightly convex areas and have fine-loamy control sections. La Brier soils are in swales and have vertic Characteristics. Tricon soils are on slightly elevated areas and have petrocalcic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
