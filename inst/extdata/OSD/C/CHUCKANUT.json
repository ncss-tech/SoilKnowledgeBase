Kapowsin soils formed in dense glacial till, have redoximorphic features within 100 cm, and are 50 to 100 cm deep to a pan cemented with aluminum, iron, and organic matter. Menzel soils are dry less than 45 days. Sadie soils have a densic contact at 65 to 100 cm and have redoximorphic features within 100 cm. Skipjack soils are greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact."

The soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from sandstone and glacial till. Chuckanut soils have a marine climate with dry, warm summers and cool, moist winters with intermittent snow cover. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 10 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is 890 to 1150 mm. The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."

At that time, Chuckanut was classified as an Ashy over loamy, amorphic over istoic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands.  There was no strong evidence to support this classification, therefore it was changed to an updated version of its original classification and concept. It is recommended that samples are collected for analysis to verify the presence or absence of andic and spodic soil properties.\n4/94 - Classification was changed to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands from medial, mesic Andic Xerocherpet\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
