At that time, Chuckanut was classified as an Ashy over loamy, amorphic over istoic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands.  There was no strong evidence to support this classification, therefore it was changed to an updated version of its original classification and concept. It is recommended that samples are collected for analysis to verify the presence or absence of andic and spodic soil properties.\n4/94 - Classification was changed to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands from medial, mesic Andic Xerocherpet\n________________________________________"
