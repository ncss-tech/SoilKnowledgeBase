  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Usually the soils between depths of about 4 and 12 inches are moist all the time from sometime in November until sometime in May and are dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 65 degrees F.  Except where drained, the soils are saturated within 40 to 60 inches of the surface from about February to May or for noncalcareous in some pedons and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, gray or grayish brown in 10YR hue, moist value is 3.  It has weak to strong, fine to medium granular structure.  The 10 to 40 inches section is very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam (18 to 35 percent clay).\nThe C horizon is dark gray, gray, light gray, light brownish gray, or grayish brown in 10YR and 2.5Y hue and in some pedons is faintly to distinctly mottled."

Foster and Grangeville soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Landlow and Omni soils have fine control sections.  Merritt and Pacheco soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter.  Sacramento soils have very fine control sections.  Sycamore soils have surface horizons that are very hard or hard and massive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Chino soils are in basins and flood plains at elevations of near sea level to 3,100 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual rainfall is 8 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F, average January temperature about 51 F, and average July temperature about 76 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 230-340 days."
