  "OVERVIEW": "The Courville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till.  These soils are on moraines, foothills, and mountain slopes in glaciated valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
