Rubbed fiber content is less than 10 percent.  The soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 through 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with strata of silt.  It has 10 to 30 percent clay.\nPumice and ash layers less than 2 inches thick may occur at depths of 20 inches or more."

The soils formed in decomposed organic material over silty lacustrine sediment with a mixture of diatomaceous earth.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  The mean July temperature is 67 to 69 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 28 to 30 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."

Pit soils are clayey throughout and crack to the surface.  Tulana soils have a mollic epipedon and andic soil characteristics at the surface.  Ozamis soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine-loamy."

Flooding is rare.  A drained phase is recognized.  Areas which have been drained may lack the histic epipedon and are considered taxadjuncts."
