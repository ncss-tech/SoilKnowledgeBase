  "OVERVIEW": "The Crump series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in decomposed organic material over silty lacustrine sediments.  They are in concave areas adjacent to open water areas in lake basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Rubbed fiber content is less than 10 percent.  The soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 through 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with strata of silt.  It has 10 to 30 percent clay.\nPumice and ash layers less than 2 inches thick may occur at depths of 20 inches or more."
