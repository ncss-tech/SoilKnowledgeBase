  "OVERVIEW": "The Climine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess high in volcanic ash.  Climine soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
