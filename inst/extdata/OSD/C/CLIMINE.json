  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Climine soils are on mountain side slopes, normally on north aspects.  These soils formed in colluvium from mixed rocks with additions of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
