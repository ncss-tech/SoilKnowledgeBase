  "OVERVIEW": "The Catelli series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or granitic rocks.  Catelli soils are on uplands and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The soil between depths of 10 and 29 inches becomes moist in some part in late November or December, and remains moist until about May.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 to 58 degrees F.  Organic matter content is more than 1 percent at depth of 10 inches and less than 1 percent at depth of 20 inches.  Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the soil to a depth of 30 inches.  Pebbles in the solum range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, dark brown, grayish brown, or brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3).  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B2 horizon is yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, or brown (10YR 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4).  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is moderatey acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is light yellowish brown, very pale brown, or pinkish gray (2.5Y 6/4; 10YR 6/4, 7/4, 8/3; 7.5YR 6/2).  It is gravelly sandy loam or sandy loam.  This horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid."
