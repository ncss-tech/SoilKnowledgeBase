  "OVERVIEW": "The Curabith series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured calcareous alluvium.  Curabith soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is commonly sandy loam with clay ranging from 8 to 18 percent, silt 10 to 30 percent, and sand 55 to 80 percent.  Rock fragments are common in all horizons and average 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma 2 through 6.  Texture is commonly sandy loam, with loamy sand in lower horizons, modified yb rock fragments.  They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The Bk1 has 10 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent decreases in lower horizons and ranges from about 5 to 30 percent."
