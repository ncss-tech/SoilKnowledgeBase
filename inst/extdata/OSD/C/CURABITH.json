  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is commonly sandy loam with clay ranging from 8 to 18 percent, silt 10 to 30 percent, and sand 55 to 80 percent.  Rock fragments are common in all horizons and average 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma 2 through 6.  Texture is commonly sandy loam, with loamy sand in lower horizons, modified yb rock fragments.  They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The Bk1 has 10 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent decreases in lower horizons and ranges from about 5 to 30 percent."

The soils formed in calcareous, moderately coarse textured marine deposits.  The annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 15 inches with peak periods of precipitations during the spring and summer.  Elevation is 4,500 to 5,500 feet.  The average annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
