Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bt horizon, and medium acid to neutral in the 2Bt and 2C horizons. The content of pebbles, chert fragments, subrounded chert fragments,  subrounded geodes or flaggy limestone ranges from 5 to 30 percent in the A horizon, from 10 to 30 percent in the Bt horizon, and from 5 to 30 percent in the 2Bt3 and 2C horizons.  Fragments are of gravel to flaggy size.\nThe Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 1OYR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Most pedons have mottles in shades of brown in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe 2Bt3 horizon has hue of 1OYR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, and has few to many brown or gray mottles.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nWhen present, the 2C horizon is mottled in hue of 7.5YR or 1OYR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay or clay."

The family is large, but those in unglaciated areas are Belmont, Conestoga, Douds, Hollinger, Kanawha, Mandeville, Mifflin, Nordin, Relay, and Summitville series.  Belmont and Summitville soils have B horizons with 5YR hue of redder.  Conestoga soils have schist fragments. Douds soils have an average annual precipitation of less than 34 inches.  Hollinger, Mandeville, Nordin and Relay soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Kanawha so11s have fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam C horizons.  Mifflin soils have B horizons with 30 to 60 percent sand and lack coarse fragments.  Hebron, Leroy, Letort, Military, Nodine, Princeton, Renona, Theresa, and Whalen have cooler temperature as they occur in states north of Kentucky."
