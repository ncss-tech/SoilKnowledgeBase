  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chelbacheb soils are on karrens of; solution, wave-cut, and raised coralline platforms; karrens on cones, valleys, and towers of karst islands.  These soils formed in organic material over coralline limestone, and probably additions of volcanic ash and tropospheric dust; bedrock is commonly part of the Peleliu limestone formation and to a lesser extent the Palau limestone formations (Recent to Pleistocene.) They are dominant under Limestone Forest plant communities. Slope is 50 to 150 percent. On the extremely steep slopes of, tower karst islands these soils are below free faces and base slopes in pockets of jagged limestone. Elevation is 1 to 214 meters (3.3 feet to 702 feet.) The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Majuro, Ngedebus, Ngerungor, Odesangel, and Peleliu soils. Ngedebus and Majuro soils are very deep somewhat excessively drained soils generally adjacent to coastal beaches. These soils formed in water and wind-deposited coral sand. Ngedebus soils are normally found on lagoon sides of island whereas Majuro soils are located on ocean sides of islands have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. These are transitional soils between the upland soils and marshes. Odesangel soils formed in depressional areas that retain fresh or brackish water. The organic layer is moderately deep with depths typically ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m (1.6 to 3.3 feet), which is shallower than the Ngerungor series. This soil may contain as much as 80 percent organic matter and has neutral soil chemistry (pH 6.6 to 7.3). Coral sand underlies the organic layer. Ngerungor soils have hemic organic deposits greater than 125 centimeters (49 inches), occur in depressional areas, and are saturated throughout the profile. Peleliu soils are clayey and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are in broadleaf evergreen limestone-forests, plant communities and are used for watershed, fuelwood, recreation, phosphate mining, and limited amounts of timber harvesting for village use. A few areas have been cleared and developed for small garden plots. The potential to develop agricultural in the limestone forest areas is limited. Many of the sites supporting Limestone Forest plant communities have very rocky, shallow soils that are less suitable for agriculture. These areas are susceptible to drought and constraints on both macro- and micro nutrient availability. Fuelwood can be collected from the limestone forests. The forests do provide wildlife habitat and serve as efficient reservoirs for nutrients. Some areas within the limestone forest could be used for agroforestry land-use systems, but may require outside input of plant nutrients to maintain productivity if relatively large amounts of biomass are removed during harvest.\nNative vegetation includes; Calophyllum inophyllum, Hernandia sonora, Guettarda speciosa, Pandanus spp. Neisosperma oppositifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Ficus spp., Premna obtusifolia, Psychotria spp., Casuarina equisetifolia, Artocarpus mariannensis and Clerodendrum inerme. Many plant communities include large trees (greater than 1 m in diameter). Many of the forest trees supported lianas and ferns."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The limestone parent material is 97 percent calcium carbonate, which limits the amounts of available essential nutrients. The source of plant nutrients is the biocycling of organic matter. The limestone bedrock is typically porous and fractured, allowing roots to penetrate into the rock.  The mineral soils that are found on limestone are the insoluble residue left after the calcium carbonate dissolves. For this reason, \"limestone soils\" is technically a misnomer but a convenient way of referring to soils developed on limestone. There are only three percent impurities in the average Peleliu or Angaur limestone from which to form soil (US DOD, 1956). Even \"insoluble\" residue dissolves over time with the less soluble components remaining in solution to precipitate and form soil minerals. Additions of volcanic ash and long-range transported dust that blows in from the continents may also contribute to soil volume. The dust may also provide needed nutrients, such as potassium, that are generally deficient in soils formed from limestone. The karst topography contains common features including pits and pinnacles, caves, depressions, and sinkholes. The limestone forming was initially underwater as a coral reef that accumulated coral debris on its surface. Tectonic uplift raised the islands to theirs present positions. After uplifting, the exposed limestone was subject to erosive processes. Rainfall eroded the high limestone deposits leaving pitted and pinnacled limestone topography.\nThe phosphate for mining is believed to have derived from guano, and is found in four-ore types: nodular, oolitic, rock phosphate, and earthy ore. The majority of the mined phosphate is of the first three types; however, the earthy ore is considered the most desirable. The chemical analysis of the dried phosphate ore averaged 33.04 percent P2O5 by weight after ignition.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nFolistic Epipedon - Surface to 20 cm (8 inches)\nSapric soil materials - Surface to 20 cm (8 inches)\nLithic contact - 20 cm (8 inches)\nLithologic discontinuity - 20 cm (8 inches)\nParticle-size control section - 0 to 20 cm (8 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data # 03PW150001 and Military Geology of Palau Islands, 1956, are used to define the series.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th edition 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
