    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Casco soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, eskers, kames, and moraines. Slope gradients range from 0 to 70 percent. Casco soils formed in a thin layer of loamy alluvium underlain by calcareous stratified sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 71 to 102 cm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F). The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 104 to 457 meters (340 to 1500 feet)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boyer, Fabius, Fox, Lorenzo, Matherton, Mussey, Rodman, and Sebewa soils. The well drained Boyer soils have a thicker loamy mantle, and contain more sand and less silt. The somewhat poorly drained Fabius soils and the poorly drained Mussey soils form a drainage sequence with Casco soils in some areas. The well drained Fox soils, the somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils, and the poorly drained Sebewa soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas and have a thicker loamy mantle. The excessively drained Rodman soils and the somewhat excessively drained Lorenzo soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Casco soils. Lorenzo soils are in areas where the surface layer is darker colored. Rodman soils are in areas where the loamy mantle is absent."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy mantle and high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 or more micrometers per second) in the sandy outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the less sloping areas are used for cropland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas are used for woodland and some for pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest. Common trees are northern red oak, black oak, and white oak."
