  "REVDATE": "06/2008",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Casmos series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Casmos soils are on hillslopes, canyons, ridges, and structural benches and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",
