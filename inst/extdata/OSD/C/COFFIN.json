It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence. Samples should also be collected to determine if this series meets the criteria for the Alic Hapludand or Eutric Hapludand subgroup.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type location user site ID--2014OR043819\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
