  "OVERVIEW": "The Crumley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
