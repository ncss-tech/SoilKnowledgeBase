  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on nearly level to steep outwash plains. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
