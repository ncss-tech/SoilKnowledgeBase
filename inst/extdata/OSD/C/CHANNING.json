  "OVERVIEW": "The Channing series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy deposits and in the underlying sand and gravel on outwash plains, stream terraces, and moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The solum ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid and the substratum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  Pebble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 10 to 50 percent in the substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 throughout. The weighted average cntent of rock fragments in the particle size control section and lower part of the series control section is less than 35 percent.  Stone content covering the surface ranges from less than 0.01 percent to 0.1 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon, up to 7 inches thick with similar colors as the A horizon.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an Oe horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR or neutral, value of 2 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  A Bhs horizon, less than 3 inches thick, is in some pedons with hue of 5YR to 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 3.  The Bhs or Bs horizons are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are stratified sand, loamy sand, coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures."
