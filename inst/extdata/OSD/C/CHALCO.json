These soils formed in pedisediment or colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 2,040 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
