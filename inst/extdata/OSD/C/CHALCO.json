  "OVERVIEW": "The Chalco series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in pedisediment or colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Chalco soils are on rock pediments, plateaus, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
