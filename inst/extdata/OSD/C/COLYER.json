  "STATES": "IN,KY,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Colyer series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils  formed in clayey residuum of weathered, black, highly fissile, bituminous shale.  These sloping to very steep soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness range from 8 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through medium acid in the A horizon and from very strongly acid to extremely acid in the B and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 to 4,and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and their channery and very channery modifiers.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent.\nThe AB horizons has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and their channery, very channery and extremely channery modifiers. Shale fragments range from 10 to 65 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, and some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow.  Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and their very channery and extremely channery modifiers.  Shale fragments range from 35 to 65 percent.\nThe C horizon has colors like those of the Bw horizon and some pedons also have mottles in shades of gray or olive.  Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam and their very channery and extremely modifiers.   Shale fragments range from 35 to 90 percent.\nThe R horizon is hard fissile shale."

Litz soils have shaly or very shaly silt loam B horizons and bedrock exceeds a depth of 20 inches and averages about 35 inches.  Rohan soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Weikert soils have shaly, very shaly, channery, or very channery silt loam B horizons."
