  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Fragments of chert or gravel ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the upper 3 feet and 15 to 45 percent below 3 feet.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral throughout.  The weighted average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 18 to about 32 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine earth fraction is dominantly silt loam or loam, but includes silty clay loam.\nThe B and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons also have a hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 or hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4.  The fine earth fraction of these horizons is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or gray in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon."

Average annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 51 inches near the type location."
