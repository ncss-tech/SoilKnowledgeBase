  "OVERVIEW": "The Crosscan series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Crosscan soils are in canyons and on hills.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
