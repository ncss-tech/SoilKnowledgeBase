  "OVERVIEW": "The Carsitas series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. The Carsitas soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, valley fills, dissected remnants of alluvial fans and in drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (3 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).",

These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations are 67 meters (220 feet) below sea level to 800 meters (2,625 feet). The climate is arid with warm, dry winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 27 degrees C (73.5 to 80.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."

Carrizo, Chemwash and Rizzo soils are on similar landscape positions and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Chuckawalla soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and an argillic and calcic horizon. Goldrose soils have a layer within the particle-size control section that has more than 35 percent rock fragments. Imperial soils have a fine-textured particle-size control section and Niland soils have a sandy over clayey particle-size control section. Rositas soils are found on nearby dunes, sand sheets and edges of bolson floors, have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section which is typically dominated by eolian fine sands."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Altered drainage may occur where irrigation or seepage has caused a seasonal water table at 2 to 5 feet. Torrential summer thundershowers occasionally produce enough runoff to flood the soil for brief periods."

Vegetation is sparse creosote bush, burrobush, barrel cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. Where irrigation water is available, the soils are used for growing citrus and grapes."
