Dalelake, Lagunita, Myoma and Rositas soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. In addition, Lagunita soils are slightly to strongly saline throughout, Myoma and Rositas soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand and Dalelake and Pintobasin soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September following convection storms and have mean annual soil temperature less than 25 degrees C (72 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carsitas soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, valley fills, dissected remnants of alluvial fans and in drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations are 67 meters (220 feet) below sea level to 800 meters (2,625 feet). The climate is arid with warm, dry winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 27 degrees C (73.5 to 80.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."

Carrizo, Chemwash and Rizzo soils are on similar landscape positions and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Chuckawalla soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and an argillic and calcic horizon. Goldrose soils have a layer within the particle-size control section that has more than 35 percent rock fragments. Imperial soils have a fine-textured particle-size control section and Niland soils have a sandy over clayey particle-size control section. Rositas soils are found on nearby dunes, sand sheets and edges of bolson floors, have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section which is typically dominated by eolian fine sands."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Altered drainage may occur where irrigation or seepage has caused a seasonal water table at 2 to 5 feet. Torrential summer thundershowers occasionally produce enough runoff to flood the soil for brief periods."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for watershed, wildlife habitat and recreation. They are a source of sand and gravel for construction material. Vegetation is sparse creosote bush, burrobush, barrel cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. Where irrigation water is available, the soils are used for growing citrus and grapes."
