The average annual precipitation ranges from 68 to 134 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Oi and A horizons).\nOxic horizon - the zone from 11 to 80 inches (Bo1, Bo2, Bo3, and Bo4 horizons).\nThese soils were formerly included in the Nipe series.  A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nCerro Gordo soils formed in the Ks-Serpentinite Formation (Ks).  It is a remnant of lateritic residual soil on serpentinite.\nCerro Gordo soils formed in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
