  "OVERVIEW": "The Cerro Gordo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridge tops of mountains in the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in iron-rich residuum that weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 79 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.",

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nCerro Gordo soils formed in the Ks-Serpentinite Formation (Ks).  It is a remnant of lateritic residual soil on serpentinite.\nCerro Gordo soils formed in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
