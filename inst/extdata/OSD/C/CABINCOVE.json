  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabincove series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum weathered from granitic rocks. The Cabincove soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1025 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
