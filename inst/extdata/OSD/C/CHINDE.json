    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 2 inches.  (A horizon)\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 2 to about 9 inches. (By and BCy horizons)\nSalic horizon - The zone from 33 to 64 inches. (Cnz1 and Cnz2 horizons)\nShrink-swell potential - This soil has high shrink-swell potential below the gypsic horizon.  The linear extensibility (LE) of the typical pedon from the soil surface to a depth of 40 inches is 10.34 cm.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-012. Lab results confirm the presence of a gypsic and a salic horizon.  Also, see: Soil and Range Inventory Report of District 12; USDI-BIA, Shiprock Agency, 1978; pedon number 4657-1.  Salinity values were also determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
