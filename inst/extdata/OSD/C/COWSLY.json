The soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 40 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 30 inches thick and the depth to the clayey argillic horizon is 12 to 40 inches.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral to about 40 inches and ranges to mildly alkaline below.  Secondary accumulation of carbonates is present below 40 inches in some pedons.  Redox concentrations typically occur between depths of 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam, cobbly ashy silt loam, or stony ashy silt loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  The lower part of this horizon is a silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has value of 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam or ashy silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  A stone line is at the lower boundary in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay and averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  The lower part of the horizon has 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel.  It is silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam or light clay and averages 27 to 45 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel."

The soils formed in loess and some volcanic ash overlying older fine textured residuum or colluvium weathered from volcanic tuff and basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Anatone soils occur on plateaus, ridgetops, and south-facing side slopes and are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Hall Ranch and Klicker soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  The Hall Ranch soils occur on mountains.  The Klicker soils occur on mountains, plateaus, and structural benches.  Tolo soils are ashy over loamy and occur on north-facing mountain side-slopes and footslopes."
