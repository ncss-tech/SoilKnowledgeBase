  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowsly series consists of deep or very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess with an influence of volcanic ash overlying older fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered from volcanic tuff and basalt. Cowsly soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Redox concentrations typically occur between depths of 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam, cobbly ashy silt loam, or stony ashy silt loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.
