    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to more than 80 inches.   Mollic colors extend from depths of 24 to over 70 inches. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy loam with an average of 18 to 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Some pedons have thin sandy or clayey strata in the control section.  Dark concretions range from none to a few throughout.  The reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Most pedons are calcareous throughout, but the calcium carbonate content is irregular with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay or clay loam in the upper part and ranges to sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam in the lower part.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have mottles with chroma of 4 to 6.  Pitted concretions and fine threads of calcium carbonate range from none to a few.\nThe Bg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles with chroma of 4 to 6 range from few to common in most pedons.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Pitted calcium carbonate concretions range from none to a few.\nSome pedons have buried A horizons below the control section."

Degola and Sinton soils are drier in the control section for longer periods of time. Gowker soils have mean annual temperatures of less than 72 degrees F., and have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chicolete soils occur on broad levees of nearly level flood plains.  Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range to 2 percent.  The soils formed in recent loamy alluvium.  These soils are flooded by stream overflow about 2 to 8 times in 10 years.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 48 to 62."
