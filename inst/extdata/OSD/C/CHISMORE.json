  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Aquic conditions occur at depths of less than 30 inches for some time during most years when not artificially drained. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Hue is 10YR. Particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay content. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Redox depletions within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon have value of 4 or more moist and chroma of 2 accompanied by redox concentrations.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. In some pedons below 40 inches this horizon is gravelly, cobbly or stony."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mayger series. Mayger soils have an ochric epipedon and are somewhat poorly drained. The Gustin series has a similar classification except for mixed mineralogy. Gustin soils have Btg horizons ranging to 2.5Y or 5Y hue and have redox depletions at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chismore soils occur on high stream terraces that have a planar or slightly convex surface. The slope commonly is 0 to 7 percent but ranges up to 12 percent on breaks at the edge of the terrace. The soils formed in old clayey alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Elevations are 100 to 1000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 220 days. This soil occurs on the Whiskey Run geomorphic surface in Coos and Curry counties, and on planar to convex areas on high stream terraces in Benton County."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eilertsen, Kirkendall, Pyburn, Quosatana, Treharne, and Zyzzug soils. Kirkendall soils are on flood plains, are well drained and lack an argillic horizon. Quosatana soils are on flood plains, are poorly drained and lack an argillic horizon. Pyburn soils are poorly drained, have 50 to 70 percent clay in the Bt, and have slickensides present in the solum. Eilertsen, Treharne, and Zyzzug soils occur on low stream terraces. Eilertsen soils are well drained; Treharne soils are moderately well drained; and Zyzzug soils are poorly drained. All three soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
