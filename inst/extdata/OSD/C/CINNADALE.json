  "OVERVIEW": "The Cinnadale series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived mainly from sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on cuestas, hogbacks, ridges and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Cypher, Deville, Roegulch, Shaboom, and Sharrott soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR. Devilfence, Kounter, and Quaint soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate in the profile. Valto soils have less than 50 percent silt in the Bw horizon and are still moist from snowmelt until mid June. Villareal soils formed in slope alluvium derived from andesite are still moist from snowmelt until mid June. In addition, Devilfence, Deville, Kounter, Quaint, Roegulch, Shaboom, and Sharrott soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
