Cypher, Deville, Roegulch, Shaboom, and Sharrott soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR. Devilfence, Kounter, and Quaint soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate in the profile. Valto soils have less than 50 percent silt in the Bw horizon and are still moist from snowmelt until mid June. Villareal soils formed in slope alluvium derived from andesite are still moist from snowmelt until mid June. In addition, Devilfence, Deville, Kounter, Quaint, Roegulch, Shaboom, and Sharrott soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
