  "OVERVIEW": "The Capa series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in clayey sediments weathered from shale.  Capa soils are in swales and toeslopes on terraces and uplands in MLRA 63A, Northern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains.   Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters (17 inches).",
