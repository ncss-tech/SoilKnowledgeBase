  "OVERVIEW": "The Cottree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, and limestone.  Cottree soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
