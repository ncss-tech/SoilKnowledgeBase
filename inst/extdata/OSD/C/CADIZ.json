Birkbeck soils have a loess (or other silty mantle) more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick to till. Compton soils average less than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Elco, Inton, Libre, Minnith, and Winfield soils do not have carbonates within the series control section.

The well drained and moderately well drained Morley soils are nearby on similar landscapes, but more common on slopes below the Cadiz soils where the loess is thinner.  On similar landscapes, but where the surface layer is darker colored, the well drained and moderately well drained Juda soils occur next to the Cadiz soils."
