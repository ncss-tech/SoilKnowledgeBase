  "OVERVIEW": "The Cadiz series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and in the underlying moderately fine textured till on loess-mantled ground moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to l2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
