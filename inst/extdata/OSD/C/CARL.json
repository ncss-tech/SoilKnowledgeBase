  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Carl series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over clayey alluvium over gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on drainageways adjacent to upland streams. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 102 cm (40 inches).",
