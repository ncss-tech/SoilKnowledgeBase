The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  from early March to early December (270 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F.  from mid April to early November.  The soil moisture control section (7 to 21 inches) is dry in all parts from mid June to mid October (ranges 120 to 130) and is moist in all parts from mid November to early May.  The particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent clay.  Cracks range from 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches wide.  They remain open during a period from July to October and remain closed for the rest of the year.  Few to common intersecting slickensides are in part of the A horizon.\nThe A and Bss horizon reaction is mildly alkaline or neutral.  Organic matter ranges from 2 to 4 percent.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/3.  It is sandy clay loam fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 7 to 11 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or mildly alkaline."
