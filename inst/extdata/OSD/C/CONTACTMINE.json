  "OVERVIEW": "The Contactmine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite and/or gneiss. The Contactmine soils are on hills and mountain. Slopes range from 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
