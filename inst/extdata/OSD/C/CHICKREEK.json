    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chickreek soils are on nearly level flood plains, outwash plains, and depressional areas on the lower part of alluvial fans. Slope range from 0 to 1 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,200 feet. The soil formed in mixed silty alluvium and diatomaceous earth that overlies sandy and gravelly alluvium. The average annual precipitation is about 20 to 35 inches, mostly occurring as snowfall. The average annual air temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."
