  "OVERVIEW": "The Chickreek series consists of moderately deep to sand and gravel, poorly drained soils formed in diatomaceous earth and silty alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains, outwash plains, and in low lying basins. Permeability is slow in the surface and upper substratum layers and very rapid in the lower layers. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Average annual precipitation is 30 inches and average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.",
