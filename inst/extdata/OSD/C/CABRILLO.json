Crispin soils are moderately deep to a cemented pan.  Mackerricher and Sirdrak soils have sandy particle-size control sections.  Mallopass soils have a thick mollic epipedon and have mottles between 50 and 60 inches.  Cleone and Heeser soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Windyhollow soils have a loamy mollic epipedon.  Flumeville soils are often in subtle depressions, have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, and have a fine particle-size control section. Stornetta soils occur on flood plains, have mottles above 10 inches, and lack an argillic horizon."
