  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinmoe series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mudstone, shale, and sandstone.  Chinmoe soils are on homoclinal ridges, cuesta.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
