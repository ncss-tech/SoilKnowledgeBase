  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 36 inches.  The average annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The seasonal high water table ranges from 6 to 18 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay,  25 to 60 percent silt and 30 to 60 percent sand.  E.C. commonly is 2 to 8 mmhos but may range to 16 in some subhorizons.  Soft masses of gypsum occur in some pedons.  Redoximorphic features are common throughout most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture commonly is loam, but the range includes light clay loam and very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist. Chroma is typically 2 but in some pedons that have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR chroma is as high as 6.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam, loam or silty clay loam, but the range includes silt loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Elevation is 6,500 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches with over half falling in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is approximately 60 to 90 days."
