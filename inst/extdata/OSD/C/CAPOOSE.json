  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface.  The upper 14 to 25 inches below the mineral soil surface has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The lower part of the particle-size control section is 2 to 12 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon, when present, has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  In places, this horizon consists largely of Mt. St. Helens 'T' ash.  It is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  It is ashy silt loam or ashy loam and may be gravelly.  It is 5 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly and is 40 to 50 percent granitic pebbles, 15 to 30 percent granitic cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent granitic stones.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly and is 40 to 70 percent granitic pebbles, 10 to 30 percent granitic cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent granitic stones."

Brannan, Crackler, Elbowlake, Farway, Kellerbutte, Natapoc, Nevine, and Saska soils are greater than 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Olot and Rouen soils have 60 to 70 percent volcanic glass in the upper part of the particle-size control section and 25 to 35 percent clay in the lower part. Vingulch soils have 5 to 30 percent pumice in the 2Bw horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Capoose soils on a shoulders and backslopes of mountains.  These soils formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium and residuum from granitic rock.  In glaciated areas these soils may have a small component of granitic glacial till.  Slopes are 20 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
