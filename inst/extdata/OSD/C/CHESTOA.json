    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to lithic contact with hard, unweathered bedrock (R) ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Content of mica flakes ranges from none to few throughout the profile.  Rock fragments, mostly pebbles, channers, and flagstones are less than 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe A, AE, or AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E or EB horizon, where percent, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bs or Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Most pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bw or BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a thin Cr layer at the soil-rock interface that is highly weathered, low-grade metasedimentary rock such as metasandstone, feldspathic metasandstone, quartzite, and arkose.  It is partially consolidated bedrock that has high excavation difficulty.\nThe R layer is hard, unweathered, low-grade metasedimentary rock such as metasandstone, feldspathic metasandstone, quartzite, and arkose.  Some R layers have vertical and horizontal fractures that are filled or coated with fine-earth material.  The R layer has very high or extremely high excavation difficulty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chestoa soils are dominantly on north- to east-facing mountain slopes and shaded ridges in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., the frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days, and the mean annual rainfall ranges from 46 to 64 inches.  Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 4,800 feet.  Slope ranges from 8 to 95 percent, but is dominantly 30 to 95 percent.  These soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, feldspathic metasandstone, quartzite, and arkose."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brookshire, Cataska, Cheoah, Ditney, Harmiller, Jeffrey, Keener, Lostcove, Northcove, Shinbone, Soco, Stecoah, Sylco, and Unicoi series.  Brookshire, Keener, Lostcove, and Northcove soils formed in colluvium and are very deep to bedrock.  The shallow Cataska soils, moderately deep Sylco soils, and Unicoi soils are in a loamy-skeletal family. Ditney soils lack the umbric intergrade feature and have mixed mineralogy.  Harmiller and Shinbone soils are in a fine-loamy family and Shinbone soils are deep to bedrock.  Jeffrey soils have mixed mineralogy.  Cheoah soils are deep to paralithic contact.  Soco and Stecoah soils lack the umbric feature.  In addition, Soco soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact and Stecoah soils are deep."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Chestoa soils are used for woodland.  The remaining areas are used for wildlife and pasture.  Forested areas include yellow-poplar, black cherry, sweet birch, yellow birch, sugar maple, northern red oak, American basswood, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye.  At elevations above 4,000 feet, yellow birch replaces yellow-poplar as a common tree.  Common understory plants include rhododendron, striped maple, serviceberry, trillium, hay scented fern, and New York fern."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Chestoa soils were formerly included with the Jeffrey series.  Jeffrey soils have mixed mineralogy.  The Chestoa series is presently classified as an Umbric intergrade of Dystrochrepts.  These soils would classify as Spodic intergrades using the same criteria as defines the Spodic subgroup of Aquepts, Psammaquents, or Udults.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons) .\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 8 to 10 inches (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 13 inches (Bs horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 26 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nLithic contact - hard bedrock contact at 26 inches (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSIR = NC0227\nMLRA = 130B\nRevised: 9/94-BPS,JAK; 10/95-BPS,JAK; 9/96-BPS,DHK\n02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys,  MLRA clarification\nCharacterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S92NC-199-008.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
