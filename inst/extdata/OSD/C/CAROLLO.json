The moisture control section is dry in all parts from May through December.  The soil has very high levels of salinity and EC ranges from 15 to 50 mmhos throughout.  Salinity commonly increases with depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/4, or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.  It is clay or silty clay and averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  This horizon commonly has strong, medium or coarse, columnar structure parting to strong, coarse, subangular blocky and less commonly has moderate or strong, medium prismatic structure.  The lower part of the B horizon is massive when moist.  This horizon has accumulations of calcium sulfate in excess of 2 percent.  The exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) ranges from 15 to 40.   Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C1 horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4; 5Y 5/2 or N 3/0 and moist color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4; 5Y 4/2, or N 3/0.  Some pedons lack mottles.  The layer of clear, nearly pure, highly fractured, crystal-line gypsum 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick that overlies the C horizon is not present in all pedons.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."
