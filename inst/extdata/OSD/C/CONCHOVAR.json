  "OVERVIEW": "The Conchovar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium from sandstone and shale on valley floors and drainageways. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
