    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the contrasting sandy 2C horizons ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Reactions commonly range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline throughout the soil, but medium acid is not excluded.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. They are silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam averaging between 35 to 48 percent clay.\nThe 2C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. The 2C1 horizons with a base chroma of 3 or more have distinct mottles with chroma of 2 or less. The 2C2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The 2C horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, and sand, but have thin lenses of silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The 2C horizons below 40 inches commonly have strata of finer textures."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other members of this family. Competing soils in other families are the Bowdre, Riley, and Tunica series. Bowdre soils are clayey over loamy. Riley soils are fine loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and they are mesic. Tunica soils do not have mollic epipedons and are clayey over loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cooter soils are formed in alluvium on nearly level to depressional areas of flood plains. The general area of their occurrence is old lakes, channels, and bayous. Surface topography is commonly undulating with Cooter soils occupying both low ridges and depressions on slopes ranging from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

Bowdre and Tunica soils are on similar positions. Bruno and Crevasse soils are sandy throughout the 10- to 40-inch control section occur higher in the landscape. Caruthersville soils have finer textures in the lower part of their 10- to 40-inch control section and occur higher in the landscape. Commerce, Hayti, Portageville, and Sharkey soils have finer textures in the lower part of their 10- to 40-inch control section and occur on similar landscapes."
