  "OVERVIEW": "The Corozo series consists of moderately deep to deep well drained soils formed in a mantle of sand underlain by clayey coastal plain deposits.  Typically, they have light gray and gray fine sand, a thin black sandy loam Bh horizon, very dark grayish brown to pale brown sandy loam to clay argillic horizon, underlain by an extremely hard and extremely firm loamy sand and sandy clay loam 3C horizon.",

Following periods of heavy rains, water moves laterally through these soils, mostly through the E horizons.  This update reclassifies the soil as Entic Alorthods.\nMLRA = 272\nSIR = PR0095"
