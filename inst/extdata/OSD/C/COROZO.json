They are from extremely and very firm and extremely hard horizons.  They slake in water.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loose, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic fine sand.\nThe Bh and 2Bh horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, with value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They range from sandy clay loam to loamy sand.  They are single grain.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, with value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay or sandy clay.  It has moderate coarse to moderate medium prismatic structure.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is from very firm to extremely firm, and extremely hard.  It slakes in water.  Texture is sandy loam to loamy sand."

All of these have sandy particle-size control sections and lack argillic horizons; in addition, the Cassia and Pomello soils have more than 9 degrees F. difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  When sampled, it was believed the Corozo soils would classify as Tropudults.  The characterization data, however, did not support this classification.  Following periods of heavy rains, water moves laterally through these soils, mostly through the E horizons.  This update reclassifies the soil as Entic Alorthods.\nMLRA = 272\nSIR = PR0095\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available on the Typical Pedon; sample nos.
