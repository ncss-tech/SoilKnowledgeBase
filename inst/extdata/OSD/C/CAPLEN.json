  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have a peraquic moisture regime.  The n-value is more than 1.0 in all layers to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Most pedons have a organic surface layer that ranges from 2 to 14 inches thick. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 4 dS/m in the upper 10 inches and from 4 to 8 dS/m in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 45 to 60 percent.\nThe O horizons, present in most pedons, have hue of 10YR, or N, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is mucky peat or muck.\nThe Ag horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or N, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  The texture is clay or silty clay, or their mucky counterpart.  Hemic and sapric materials ranges up to 50 percent of the horizon in some pedons.  A few pedons have depletions in shades of gray or greenish gray.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or N, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  In some pedons below 40 inches, strata of loam or sandy loam occur.  Also in some pedons, the lower horizons are stratified with organic materials.  Redox depletions and accumulations, in shades of gray and brown, range from few to many."

Competing soils in similar families are the Banker, Barbary, Larose, Placedo, Tatlum, Tracosa, and Scatlake series.  Creole and Leerco soils have n-value of less than 1 in the upper 10 inches, and in addition, Creole soils are moderately saline.  Bancker, Barbary, Larose, and Scatlake soils have a very-fine particle-size control section.  Tatlum soils have n-value of less than 1 within 40 inches, and have EC of 25 dS/m or more in the control section.  Placedo and Tracosa soils have n-value of less than 0.7."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caplen soils are in backwater marsh areas that are associated with tidal areas.  They formed in predominantly clayey alluvial sediments near the coast.  They are covered with 2 to 14 inches of water by daily high tides.  The salinity of the tidal waters that affect these areas have been significantly diluted by fresh water runoff.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 65 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 70 to 72 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 250 to 270.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 1 foot.  Thorthwaite P-E index ranges from 64 to 82."
