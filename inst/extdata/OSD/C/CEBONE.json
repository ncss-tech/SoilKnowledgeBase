  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick and the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The estimated organic carbon content of the mollic epipedon ranges from .6 to 1.5 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  Typically, conductivity is less than 1 millimho, calcium carbonate equivalent less than 1 percent, and exchangeable sodium percentage less than 1.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base-saturated.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 60 to 90 milliequivalents per hundred grams of clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are commonly less than 10 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 47 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 45 to 60 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3).  Typically, the horizon has crumb or granular primary structure but is weak platy in the lower portion or weak subangular blocky throughout in some pedons.  It is soft to slightly hard.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly acid or neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3).  Typically, the horizon has platy primary structure but it has subangular blocky or granular structure in some pedons.  It is soft to slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  After crushing and mixing, the horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  (The range in color is wide due to the variegated nature of the parent sediments.)  It is slightly acid to neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3).  The B2t horizon usually had medium or coarse angular blocky structure.  It is typically clay but content of clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 10 to 40 percent, and sand from 15 to 50 percent.  This horizon has oriented clay films on faces of peds, in root channels and in soil pores.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping upland mountainsides and ridge crests, typically at elevations in excess of 8,000 feet.  The soils formed in sediments weathered from underlying multicolored Morrison shales and interbedded sandstones.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 45 percent.  At the type location, average annual precipitation is 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer months.  Average annual temperature is 40 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
