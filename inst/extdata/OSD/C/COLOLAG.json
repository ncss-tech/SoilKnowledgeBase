  "OVERVIEW": "The Cololag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Cololag soils are on fan fan remnant summits. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F.",
