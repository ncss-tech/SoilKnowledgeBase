Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,350 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches including 10 to 30 inches of annual snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 49 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
