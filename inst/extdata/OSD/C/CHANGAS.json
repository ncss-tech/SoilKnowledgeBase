These soils formed in gypsiferous clayey lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."

Corazones and Ojinaga soils occur on higher positions, and Pantera soils occur on lower drainageways.  Melado soils do not have a gypsic horizon and occur on lower areas."
