  "OVERVIEW": "The Cublee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and limestone rock. The Cublee soils are on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
