  "OVERVIEW": "The Clementine series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with influence from loess. The Clementine soils are on flood plains, stream terraces and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
