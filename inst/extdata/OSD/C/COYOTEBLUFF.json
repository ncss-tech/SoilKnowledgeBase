  "OVERVIEW": "The Coyotebluff series consists of deep, well-drained soils on mountain sideslopes. Coyotebluff soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over granitic colluvium. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature about 41 degrees F.",
