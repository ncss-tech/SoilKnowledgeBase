  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured, unconsolidated volcanic rock ranges from 15 to 28 inches.  Depth to hard, fractured, consolidated volcanic bedrock ranges from 28 to 36 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 2 to 12 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated fractured volcanic rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated volcanic bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cuchillas soils are on side slopes and summits of mountains on the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA. Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum material weathered from volcanic rocks. The climate is humid tropical. The average annual precipitation ranges from 56 to 109 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F."

All of these soils are very deep and have more clay in the control section.  They are on similar positions with the exception of Humatas which is isothermic and on adjacent lower positions."
