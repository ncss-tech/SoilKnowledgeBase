  "BYREV": "Rev. REG; LHR; JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuchillas series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes and summits of mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum that weathered from volcanic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 77 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent.",

Hwy. 374 and about 250 feet north of Hacienda La Salvacion homestead on coffee plantation.\nUSGS Monte Guilarte topographic quadrangle (1960).

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured, unconsolidated volcanic rock ranges from 15 to 28 inches.  Depth to hard, fractured, consolidated volcanic bedrock ranges from 28 to 36 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 2 to 12 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated fractured volcanic rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated volcanic bedrock."
