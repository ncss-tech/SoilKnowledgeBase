The soils formed in fine-textured sediments underlain by medium and moderately coarse-textured alluvium at depths of about 2 feet. The alluvium is derived from acid and basic igneous rocks, quartzite, shale and limestone. Elevations are 400 to 2,500 feet. The climate is hot arid and semiarid continental. Mean annual precipitation is 3 to 10 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 67 degrees to 75 degrees F. Frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."

Casa Grande soils have natric horizons and are on slightly higher relict basin floors.  Dateland, Denure and Sasco soils have cambic horizons and are on slightly higher stream terraces and relict basin floors.  Gadsden, Gilman, Glenbar, and Pimer soils are on adjacent flood plains.  Gadsden soils are fine, Gilman soils are coarse-loamy, and Glenbar and Pimer soils are fine-silty."
