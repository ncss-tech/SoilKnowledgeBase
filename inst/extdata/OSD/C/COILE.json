  "OVERVIEW": "The Coile series consists of shallow to moderately deep, well drained, cyclic soils on uplands.  Permeability is moderate to moderately slow.  They formed in residuum from tilted and acid shale.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Cycles of Bt and Bw horizons range from 3 to about 15 feet apart and the size of each pedon ranges from 3 to about 15 square feet.  The argillic horizon is discontinuous and a shallow paralithic contact is in at least part of each pedon. In areas where the paralithic contact is within 20 inches, the argillic horizon is usually less than 10 inches thick, if present, and the C horizon may not be present.  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 8 to 30 inches but averages less than 20 inches in each pedon.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Channers of shale range from 5 to 50 percent in the A horizon, from 15 to 75 percent in the Bw/Bt horizon, and from 15 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.  In eroded areas, texture of fine-earth fraction may be silty clay loam.\nThe Bw/Bt horizon;  The Bw part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or loam.  Relict mottles, mostly from decomposed shale channers, are in shades of yellow, brown or olive and range from none to many.  Manganese masses, concretions, and coatings on rock fragments range from none to many.  Some clayey areas may have hue of 2.5YR.\nThe C horizon, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Relict mottles in shades of yellow, brown or olive, range from none to many.  Manganese masses, concretions, and coatings on rock fragments range none to many.  Some areas may have hue of 2.5YR.  Intrusions of soft shale ranging from 1/4 inch to 2 inches thick are common and have the same dip as the Cr horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon is thin-bedded, brown, yellow or olive soft shale that is tilted and folded.  Many rock fragments have manganese, silt, or clay coatings."

The Ruptic feature is not easily observable in small excavations.  A long trench or road cut is needed to determine distance between cycles, pedon size, and average horizon depths.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  0 to 3 inches.\nRuptic feature:  3 to 10 inches.\nParalithic contact:  18 inches average, but ranges from about 8 to 28 inches in the typical pedon.\nSIR Number:  TN1302"
