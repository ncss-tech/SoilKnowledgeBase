  "OVERVIEW": "The Coff series consists of moderately deep over petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in material derived from calcareous shale and limestone.  The Coff soils are on mountain foothill slopes and have 30 to 50 percent slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
