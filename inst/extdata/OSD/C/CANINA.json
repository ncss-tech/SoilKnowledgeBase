  "OVERVIEW": "The Canina series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous, eolian loess deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping plains and parna dunes of the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 460 mm (18 in).",
