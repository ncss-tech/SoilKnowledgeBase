  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soils are moist in winter and spring. They are warmer than 41 degrees F. from about early April to late October, and they are dry within this period for 80 to 120 days (xeric moisture regime). The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 5 to 10 inches. The solum averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent stones, cobbles, and gravel. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 20 to 35 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel. It has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It has moderate subangular or angular blocky structure. It has 40 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in materials weathered from basalt and welded tuff. The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and hot dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 90 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gardone, Lorella, Madeline, and Westbutte soils. Gardone soils are on the sides of dissecting drainageways, are deep, and have loamy sand textures. Lorella soils are mesic, on south facing ravine slopes, and are 12 to 20 inches deep over bedrock. Westbutte soils are loamy-skeletal, lack an argillic horizon, and are moderately deep."
