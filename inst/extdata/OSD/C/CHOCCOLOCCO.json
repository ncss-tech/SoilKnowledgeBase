  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Depth to hard rock is more than 60 inches. These soils range from medium acid to very strongly acid, except for the surface in limed areas. Mica flakes range from none to common. Weatherable minerals in the 20- to 200-micron fracture of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon are 10 percent or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from none to many usually increasing with depth. Texture is dominantly silty clay loam, but includes clay loam, loam, and silt loam. Average clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.\nThe C or BC horizon, where present, has the same hue, value, chroma, and mottles as the B2t horizon. Texture is loam or sandy loam. The lower C horizons usually contain strata of gravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Brandon, Pickwick, and Silerton series in the same family and Alamance, Cahaba, Maxton, Spadra, State, and Wickham series in related families. Brandon soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Pickwick soils have Bt\nhorizons in hue of 5YR or redder. Silerton soils are bisequal\nwith the upper part of the solum in loess and the lower part in brittle clayey material. Alamance soils have siliceous mineralogy. Cahaba, Maxton, Spadra, State, and Wickham soils have control sections with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Choccolocco soils are on nearly level flood plains and stream terraces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. The regolith is stratified fluvial sediments derived from weathered Talladega slate with admixtures of sediments from limestone, cherty limestone, quartzite, shale, and sandstone. Average rainfall is 52 inches near the type location, and mean annual air temperature is 53 degrees F."

Altavista and Falkner soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less within the upper 24 inches of the Bt horizon. Ellisville soils lack Bt horizons and Masada and McQueen soils have clayey Bt horizons."
