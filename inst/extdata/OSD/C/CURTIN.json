  "OVERVIEW": "The Curtin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium weathered from basalt, volcanic breccia and tuffs.  Curtin soils are on broad alluvial fans, drainageways and concave foot slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but have a dry period during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The soils have cracks that open for 60 to 80 consecutive days in most years during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is commonly 60 inches or more.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Small (1 to 3 mm) concretions are common throughout the profile in some pedons.  The control section is clay with more than 60 percent clay.  Slickensides are close enough to intersect in all or part of the control section.  Depth to aquic conditions and redox concentrations is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or less moist and dry.\nThe Bss2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe  Bss3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Below 40 inches textural stratification is common in some pedons."

The soils formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium weathered predominantly from basalt but also volcanic breccia and tuffs.  The climate is characterized by warm and dry summers and cool and moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., average January temperature is about 39 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 235 days."
