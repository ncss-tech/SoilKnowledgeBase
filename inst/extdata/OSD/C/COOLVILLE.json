  "OVERVIEW": "The Coolville series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin loess mantle and the underlying clayey residuum weathered mainly from acid shale. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum\nand slow or very slow in the lower part. These upland soils are on summits and benches of hills, and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to the paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. The silty mantle commonly is from 14 to 22 inches, but ranges to 26 inches in thickness. Thin flat pararock fragments of shale and siltstone range up to 5 percent by volume in the Ap and Bt horizons, up to 15 percent in the 2Bt horizons, and up to 30 percent in the 2BC and in 2C horizons, where present.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, and an E horizon. The A has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 (4 to 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap, A, and E horizons typically are silt loam, but the Ap horizon is silty clay loam in some eroded pedons. Reaction is\nneutral to extremely acid, depending on liming history.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. The clay content averages 30 to 40 percent, and the sand content averages 1 to 5 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8 (2 or 3 also in the lower part). Thin subhorizons in the lower part have hue of 2.5Y. Redox accumulations are of high chroma or variegations of 2.5YR or 5YR hue are present where matrix hue is 7.5YR or\n10YR. The 2Bt horizon is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. The clay content averages from 35 to 60 percent, and the sand content averages from 1 to 12 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 2 to 8, with redox features. It is silty clay or silty clay loam, or their channery analogues. The clay content averages from 35 to 60 percent, and the sand content averages from 1 to 10 percent. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon that has similar color, texture and reaction range as the 2BC horizon.\nBedrock is mainly soft acid clay shale, and includes thin interbeds of siltstone or fine grained sandstone."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 52 to 57 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Rarden soils and the Brownsville, Gilpin, Kurtz, Latham, Rigley, Shelocta, Stonehead, Tilsit, Upshur, Wellston,\nand Zanesville soils. The moderately deep Gilpin, Rarden, and Latham soils are on summits and side slopes that do not have a loess mantle or the mantle is less than 14 inches thick. In addition, Gilpin soils are well drained and fine-loamy, and\nLatham soils have lower base saturation. The deep, well drained Upshur soils are on summits and sideslopes, and are commonly intermingled with the Gilpin soils. Brownsville soils are mainly on steep or very steep side slopes, whereas Rigley and Shelocta soils are more common on footslopes or benches and some summits. The well drained Kurtz soils are on backslopes. The moderately well drained Stonehead soils are on summits and shoulders. Brownsville, Rigley, and\nShelocta soils contain less clay. In addition, Brownsville soils contain more rock fragments in the solum. Tilsit, Wellston and Zanesville soils are in similar landscape positions. Wellston soils contain less clay and Tilsit and Zanesville soils have a fragipan."
