    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carpetflat soils are on summits of fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rock. Elevations range from 470 to 775 meters (1,540 to 2,540 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Aquapeak soils are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon above the duripan. Missionsweet soils are on steeper sideslopes of fan remnants and have a less than strongly cemented duripan with an upper boundary 36 to 50 centimeters from the soil surface. Pintobasin soils are on adjacent fan aprons, are very deep, have sandy particle-size control sections and do not have diagnostic horizons."
