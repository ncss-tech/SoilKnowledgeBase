  "OVERVIEW": "The Carpetflat series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid rocks. Carpetflat soils are on summits of fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
