It is neutral or slightly acid depending on Liming history.  The Cg horizon has hue of 10 YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 8. The higher chroma coincides with the presence of carbonates.  It is sand or fine sand.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Kingsville soils have more acid sola. Tobico soils have carbonates above a depth of 20 inches.  Vestaburg soils have more gravel in the control section."
