  "OVERVIEW": "The Crandall series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate.  Crandall soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
