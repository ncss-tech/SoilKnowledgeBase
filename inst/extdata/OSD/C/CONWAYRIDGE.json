  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Conwayridge soils are on moraines.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
