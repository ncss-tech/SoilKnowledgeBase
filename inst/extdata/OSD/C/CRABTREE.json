The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 8 and 24 inches during the summer.  The depth to the densic material is 40 to 60 inches.  The solum has an estimated clay content of 15 to 25 percent and is slightly smeary.  Boulders typically occupy about 5 percent of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 55 percent rock fragments.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Mottles are few to many, distinct or prominent.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 20 to 30 inches.  It has 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It is very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam."
