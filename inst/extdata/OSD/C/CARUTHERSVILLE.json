  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are calcareous with slight to strong effervescence in all horizons below a depth of 10 inches and in many pedons, they are calcareous to the surface. The upper 10 inches is neutral to mildly alkaline and below it is mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5, 6 or more dry; and chroma of 2. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3, 4, or 5 and chroma of 2. The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Few fine, faint mottles with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and chroma of 2 often occur above 20 inches but are not considered to be caused by prolonged periods of saturation. Mottles a below depth of 20 inches range from few to common and faint to distinct and typically have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures are very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nStratification in the C and Cg horizons below a depth of 40 inches becomes more variable and strongly expressed with depth. Colors with hue of 5Y or neutral are common. These horizons are mainly very fine sandy loam and silt loam with thin strata of loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, and fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Severn series is the only other member of this family. Other competing series are the Adler, Collins, Convent, and Robinsonville series. Severn soils have redder hue and lack mottles or matrix colors with chroma of 2 or less. Adler, Collins, Convent, and Robinsonville soils lack free carbonates in one or more subhorizons between a depth of 10 and 20 inches. In addition, Collins soils are acid, Convent soils are wetter, and Robinsonville soils are coarse-loamy."

Bowdre, Commerce, Mhoon, and Hayti soils have more than 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section and occur on lower parts of the flood plains. Crevasse soils have a sandy control section and are along stream channels and along levee breaks."

There is a seasonal high water table when associated drainage channels are full during late winter and spring. Seasonal high water tables are associated with peak flows of the Mississippi River."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Robinsonville series or treated as undifferentiated alluvial soils. Under normal conditions, the water table is at a depth of 4 to more than 6 feet. Because water table depths do occur at depths of 2 to 3 feet for short periods of time when peak flow occurs on the Mississippi River, high water table will be designated as 2 to 3 feet. This results in the proper ratings for the conditions that occur in this soil. Since the high water table occurs at a time when the soil temperature is below biological zero (5 degrees C), the Caruthersville series is considered to be Typic instead of Aquic. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches; udic moisture regime."
