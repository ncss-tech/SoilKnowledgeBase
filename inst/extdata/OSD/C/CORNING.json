    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 23 to 60 inches.  Soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F throughout the year.  Mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F at 20 inches.  Solum thickness differs over short distances because of hummocky microrelief.\nThe soil between depths of 7 and 20 inches is usually moist in some part from about late October until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 55 percent.\nThe A and Bw horizon are 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6; 2.5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 10YR 5/6, 5/4, and 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 3/4, and 3/3 and 7.5YR 4/4, 3/3, 3/4; 5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/4, 4/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/4.  In the concave intermound, the upper 2 to 9 inches of the A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4 and moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 3/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or cobbly equivalents.  Content of coarse fragments is 0 to 35 percent.  In some pedons organic matter content is greater than 1 percent in the upper 1 to 3 inches but in all pedons it decreases to less than 1 percent below this depth.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Base saturation by sum of cations is 35 to 75 percent.\nPedons in which the depth to the Bt horizon is greater than 20 inches have a BA horizon.  Color is similar to the A horizon color on the mound.  Texture, reaction and base saturation are similar to the A horizon.  Clay content is 1 to 4 percent higher and increases within a vertical distance of greater than 12 inches.\nThe upper Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6, or 5/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/6, 4/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6. The lower part of the horizon has hue of 7.5YR in some pedons.  Texture is clay loam or clay or their gravelly equivalents with 35 to 55 percent clay in the upper part and clay, sandy clay loam or clay loam or their gravelly equivalents in the lower part.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 35 percent with 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Increase in clay content at the upper boundary is 15 to 40 percent within 1 inch.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.  Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent.\nThe lower Bt horizons are 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6, or 5/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/6, 4/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6..  Texture is loamy coarse sand to clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly equivalents with 10 to 30 percent clay.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 50 percent with 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline. In some pedons this horizon has discontinuous weak cementation."

Millsap soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Orognen soils have a soil temperature below 47 degrees from January 1 to February 15 and a frost free season of 190 to 240 days.  Yokayo soils have 10YR or 2.5Y hues in the Bt horizon.  Hytop soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

Elevations are 75 to 1,300 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in gravelly alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F, average January temperature is about 45 degrees F and average July temperature is 77 to 82 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 185 to 290 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap, )\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 21 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4)\nAbrupt textural change - 21 inches\nEdits made after sdjr projects - Profile updated by amalgamating the original lab pedon description from 1945 (S1945CA103014) with the re-described CA645 TUD and incorporation of lab data (gravel) from the CA645 manuscript with current interpretation of morphology. The lab pedon description has horizon designations of 2C1 and 2C2 for the lower two horizons. These horizons are currently interpreted as the initial coarse channel deposits below the initial overbank deposits and not as a lithologic discontinuity. The CA645 TUD is not designated with a lithologic discontinuity. Neither description has the clay horizon at the abrupt textural change designated as a lithologic discontinuity.\nThis series concept attempts to cover both mound and swale positions. Separate series are needed for different ponding and water table dynamics as well as profile characteristics. AEC\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon sampled as S1945CA103014 in SSIR NO. 24.  Other pedons in Sacramento Co. sampled for complete characterization by Lincoln NE NSSL in 1979; pedon numbers are S79CA-067-002 and S79CA-067- 003 for the mound and swale, respectively. Taxadjunct sampled in Glenn County: NSSL Pedon S45CA-021-012. Also Pedon S45CA-021-013 in Glenn County, CA and S45CA-103-003 in Tehama County.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
