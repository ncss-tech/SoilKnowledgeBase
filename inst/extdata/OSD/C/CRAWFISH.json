The soil is formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt with a mixture of volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is 34 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free period is 15 to 70 days."
