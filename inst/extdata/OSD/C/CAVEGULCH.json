  "STATES": "UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavegulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in local alluvium and residuum derived from gypsiferous shale.  They are on hillsides, alluvial fans, and gently rolling uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The particle-size control section averages clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Organic carbon in the upper 40 centimeters averages 0.8 to 1.5 percent.  Hue is  2.5Y through 7.5YR.  The soil is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe Bw, cambic horizon, has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 2 through 4 mmhos.\nThe By, gypsic horizon, has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It averages 15 to 30 percent gypsum.  EC ranges from 4 through 12 mmhos.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 4.  It commonly is massive but has weak platy shale rock structure in some pedons.  EC is greater than 8 mmhos."
