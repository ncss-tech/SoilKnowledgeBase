  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to continuous gypsum accumulation is 11 to 27 inches.  The particle-size control section averages clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Organic carbon in the upper 40 centimeters averages 0.8 to 1.5 percent.  Hue is  2.5Y through 7.5YR.  The soil is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe Bw, cambic horizon, has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 2 through 4 mmhos.\nThe By, gypsic horizon, has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It averages 15 to 30 percent gypsum.  EC ranges from 4 through 12 mmhos.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 4.  It commonly is massive but has weak platy shale rock structure in some pedons.  EC is greater than 8 mmhos."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cavegulch soils are on hillsides, alluvial fans, and gently rolling uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  They formed in local alluvium and residuum derived from gypsiferous shale.  Elevations are 5,000 to 5,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
