  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cormol series consists of shallow over tuff, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks.  Cormol soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
