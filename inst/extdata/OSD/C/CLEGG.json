Clay content of the particle size control section is 18 to 35 percent and coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 61 to 63 degree F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak thin platy or fine granular structure in the upper 2 to 4 inches and weak fine granular or weak medium subangular blocky structure below this depth.  This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Organic matter ranges 1 to 4 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist , and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 to 3 moist to a depth of more than 20 inches.  At depths greater than 20 inches, values may be 6 dry, 4 moist, and chroma of 4.  Texture ranges from loam to light clay loam.  Structure is weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky with many faint or distinct clay films on faces of peds.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Organic matter content ranges 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Organic matter content ranges 1 to 2 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges 15 to 40 percent.  Texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from sandy loam to clay loam.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges 5 to 25 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent."
