  "OVERVIEW": "The Clegg series are very deep, well drained, moderately slow or moderately permeable soils on alluvial fans.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous, sedimentary, and metasedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak thin platy or fine granular structure in the upper 2 to 4 inches and weak fine granular or weak medium subangular blocky structure below this depth.  This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Organic matter ranges 1 to 4 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist , and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 to 3 moist to a depth of more than 20 inches.  At depths greater than 20 inches, values may be 6 dry, 4 moist, and chroma of 4.  Texture ranges from loam to light clay loam.
