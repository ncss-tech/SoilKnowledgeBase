  "OVERVIEW": "The Clareville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on base slope on draws and drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but mainly less that 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F)",
