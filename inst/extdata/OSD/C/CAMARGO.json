  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam with clay content of 18 to 35 percent, and particles coarser than very fine sand comprise less than 15 percent.  Stratification consists of 2 to 3 inch layers and lenses of clay to very fine sandy loam.  Bedding planes are evident below the Ap horizons and throughout undisturbed pedons.\nThe A and C horizons are grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  Moist color values are more than 3.5.  A few brownish and yellowish mottles are in the C horizon of some pedons.  Below 40 inches the soil varies from silty clay to sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils include Clairemont, Colorado, Glendale, Largo, Matamoros, and Rio Grande series.  Clairemont, Colorado, Glendale, and Largo soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Clairemont and Colorado soils have colors in hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR.  Glendale soils occur in a drier environment and are usually dry in the moisture control section.  Largo and Matamoros soils have more than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Rio Grande soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Camargo soils occur on nearly level, active flood plains of the Rio Grande and its tributaries.  The soils flood about once in every 15 years.  The soil formed in calcareous silty sediments, slightly altered and several feet thick.  The climate is semirid to dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 27 inches, mean annual air temperature is 71 to 74 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index is about 24 to 34."

Grulla soils have more than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Zalla soils have a 10- to 40-inch control section of loamy fine sand or sand."
