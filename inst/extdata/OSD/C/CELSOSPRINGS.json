  "OVERVIEW": "Celsosprings soils consist of deep, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt, rhyolite, or andesite.  Celsosprings soils are on fan terraces and mesa tops. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
