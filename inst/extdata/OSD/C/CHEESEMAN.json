  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Cheeseman soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Base saturation usually is more than 90 percent but ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The solum typically extends to the bedrock, but C horizons occur in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons, particularly in the surface horizons, but a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the bedrock have hue of 5YR or redder.  A high percentage of the sand fraction is angular and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon usually has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically coarse sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 40 to 70 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand."

Assinniboine, Evanston, Joplin, Kevin, Morval, Telstad, and Villa Grove soils are calcareous in the lower solum or C horizon, have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation, and lack bedrock above depth of 40 inches.  Bostwick, Jarre, Perrypark, Peyton and Turret soils lack bedrock above depth of 40 inches.  Marmarth soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, are calcareous, and have continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cheeseman soils are on gently to moderately sloping uplands.  They formed in parent materials weathered from underlying reddish brown and red arkosic sandstone of the Lyons and Fountain formations.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer."
