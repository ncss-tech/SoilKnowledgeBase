The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F from about March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.  The mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The surface is covered by 5 to 40 percent rock fragments with 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  Textures are loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand and gravelly loamy sand.  Rock fragment content is 5 to 35 percent consisting of 5 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders.  The organic carbon content is 0.2 to 0.4 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 2.5y 4/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/2 or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.  Textures are stratified loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly loamy fine sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly loamy sand, cobbly loamy sand and very cobbly loamy coarse sand.

Mineralogy is assumed to be mixed.  Parent material is granitic alluvium.\n3.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.  M.A.P. is 15 to 20 cm.\n4.  The soil temperature regime is on the cool end of thermic.  M.A.S.  T. is 15 to 17 degrees C.  This is extrapolated from actual soil temperature data over the past years using 12 month averages and Rod Arkley's formula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
