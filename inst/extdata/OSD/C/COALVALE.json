  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coalvale soils are on summits, shoulders, backslopes, footslopes and toeslopes on uplands that have been created and/or altered by earth moving equipment. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in spoils of surface mining which have been smoothed.  The spoils contained geologic materials that are less than strongly cemented, soil material and rock fragments.  The original soil material developed from Pennsylvanian age geology. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1041 to 1194 mm (41 to 47 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 17 degrees C (55 to 63 degrees F). Elevation is 170 to 320 meters (558 to 1050 feet) above mean sea level. P-E index 66 to 78."

Brazilton soils have less than 15 percent pararock and rock fragments above 102 cm (40 inches).  Kanima soils are on adjacent non-reclaimed areas."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 107 cm (1 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium on gentle slopes and high on steeper slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1 to 4 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are typically managed as pasture.  Some areas are used for home sites and recreation.  Common plants managed in pastures are fescue, Korean lespedeza and bermudagrass.  Woody species, annual forbs and annual grasses are common invaders in many areas where managed plants do not survive.  Home sites are often located near water bodies that were created by mining and/or reclamation."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  the zone from 25 to 100 cm (10 to 39 inches).  (^C1 and ^C2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches).  (^A horizon)\nDiagnostic horizon fragments:  Fragments of argillic horizons are present in random locations in the profile.  While the remnant clay films were not visible under field conditions at the time of sampling, the brown silty clay material appears to be remnant argillic horizon.  Photomicrographs of a pedon 150 feet east (99KS037001) of the type location shows a clay film.  Many pedons have fragments of mollic epipedons and argillic horizons through the profile.\nThe assignment of cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample user pedon ids: 99KS037001 and 99KS037002.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy Twelfth Edition, 2014\nFormerly these soils were mapped as Kanima soil series.\nThe multiple, artificially created landform segments on which this soil occurs creates a range of drainage classes and soil moisture regimes.\nThe parafragments in this soil may cause lab analysis to underestimate the percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Sample preparation which crushes the parafragments may increase the sand and silt fractions relative to clay.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska User pedon id: 99KS037001, 99KS037002\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
