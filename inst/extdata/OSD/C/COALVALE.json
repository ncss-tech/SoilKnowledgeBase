  "OVERVIEW": "The Coalvale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils on interfluves and hillslopes.  These soils formed in spoils of surface mining which have been smoothed.  The spoils contained geologic materials that are less than strongly cemented, soil material and rock fragments.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1082 mm (42 to 46 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

The spoils contained geologic materials that are less than strongly cemented, soil material and rock fragments.  The original soil material developed from Pennsylvanian age geology.

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 107 cm (1 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium on gentle slopes and high on steeper slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1 to 4 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow."

Common plants managed in pastures are fescue, Korean lespedeza and bermudagrass.  Woody species, annual forbs and annual grasses are common invaders in many areas where managed plants do not survive.  Home sites are often located near water bodies that were created by mining and/or reclamation."

(^C1 and ^C2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches).  (^A horizon)\nDiagnostic horizon fragments:  Fragments of argillic horizons are present in random locations in the profile.  While the remnant clay films were not visible under field conditions at the time of sampling, the brown silty clay material appears to be remnant argillic horizon.  Photomicrographs of a pedon 150 feet east (99KS037001) of the type location shows a clay film.  Many pedons have fragments of mollic epipedons and argillic horizons through the profile.\nThe assignment of cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample user pedon ids: 99KS037001 and 99KS037002.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy Twelfth Edition, 2014\nFormerly these soils were mapped as Kanima soil series.\nThe multiple, artificially created landform segments on which this soil occurs creates a range of drainage classes and soil moisture regimes.\nThe parafragments in this soil may cause lab analysis to underestimate the percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Sample preparation which crushes the parafragments may increase the sand and silt fractions relative to clay."
