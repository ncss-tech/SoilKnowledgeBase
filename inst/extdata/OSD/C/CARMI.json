    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 34 inches. Solum thickness is greater than 40 inches. The particle size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay but individual layers may range as low as 10 to as high as 22 percent clay.\nThe Ap and A horizons have a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or sandy loam. Rock fragment content is less than 15 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an AB or BA horizon.\nThe Bt and/or 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The texture typically is loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy clay loam but thin layers of loamy coarse sand are present in some pedons in the lower parts of Bt or 2Bt horizons. Rock fragment content is typically less than 35 percent by volume but individual layers, below 40 inches, may contain as much as 50 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\n.\nThe BCt or 2BCt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is typically stratified. Textures include sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, and sand or coarse sand. Rock fragment content is typically less than 35 percent by volume but individual layers may contain as much as 50 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures include sand or coarse sand. Rock fragment content is typically less than 35 percent by volume, however individual strata may contain more. Reaction ranges from  slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Effervescence ranges from very slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent."

The well drained Alvin, Ridgway, and Stockland soils are on similar or slightly higher landforms than Carmi soils.   Alvin and Ridgway soils have a lighter colored surface soil.\nStockland soils have more gravel in the particle size control section.  The poorly drained Ruark soils are on the same landforms but are in slight depressions and have a light colored surface layer.  The poorly and very poorly\ndrained Westland soils are in depressions, have a dark colored surface, and are on the same landforms.  The well drained Haymond, the poorly drained Titus, and the somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are on floodplains below Carmi soils."

Horizons below 26 inches meet mollic color and base saturation criteria, but do not meet organic carbon requirement);\nCambic horizon- 18 to 57 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons)\nUdic moisture regime;\nMesic temperature regime.\nAdditional Data:  Data for the original OSD location (within 50 feet from the new location) was used to assist with classification.  Pedon number S73IL-023-001 is at the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.  Other data for the Carmi series is available from NSSL and on file at the MLRA Project Office in Charleston, Illinois\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
