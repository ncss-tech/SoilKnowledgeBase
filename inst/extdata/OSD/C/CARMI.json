Horizons below 26 inches meet mollic color and base saturation criteria, but do not meet organic carbon requirement);\nCambic horizon- 18 to 57 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons)\nUdic moisture regime;\nMesic temperature regime.\nAdditional Data:  Data for the original OSD location (within 50 feet from the new location) was used to assist with classification.  Pedon number S73IL-023-001 is at the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.  Other data for the Carmi series is available from NSSL and on file at the MLRA Project Office in Charleston, Illinois"
