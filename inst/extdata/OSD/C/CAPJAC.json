  "OVERVIEW": "The Capjac series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits influenced by high amounts of volcanic ash and diatoms.  Capjac soils are on lake basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and annual snowfall is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

More study is needed for this series to confirm the medial substitute class and the placement in the Andisol order.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 10 and 65 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the A, AC, C1, and C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section and medial substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (A and AC horizons and part of the C1 horizon)."
