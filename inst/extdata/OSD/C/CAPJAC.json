    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Capjac soils are on lake basins.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from lacustrine deposits influenced by high amounts of volcanic ash and diatoms.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,030 to 4,100 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and annual snowfall is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of March 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Medial, mesic Typic Endoaquands.  The remainder of this document has not been completely updated.  More study is needed for this series to confirm the medial substitute class and the placement in the Andisol order.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 10 and 65 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the A, AC, C1, and C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section and medial substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (A and AC horizons and part of the C1 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
