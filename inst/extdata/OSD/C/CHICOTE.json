  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 14 to 61 inches thick.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  The soil from a depth of 6 inches to 16 inches is moist in some part from December to mid March and moist in all parts for at least 60 days from mid January to mid March.  It is dry in all parts for about 210 days from April to December.  Soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/3.  It is too thin or does not meet both moist and dry color requirements to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  The texture is clay loam or silty clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  Some pedons have a 2 to 10 inch overwash of silt loam.   It usually is noncalcareous but some pedons are effervescent with disseminated lime.\nThe B horizon has a dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2; 5Y 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 5Y 5/2, 5/3.  Texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  Gypsum content ranges from a trace to 25 percent.  The sodium absorption ratio is from 15 to 50 in some part of the B horizon within 16 inches of its upper boundary.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 5 to 35 mmho/cm.  It usually is noncalcareous but some pedons are effervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated and segregated lime.\nSome pedons have C horizons which have the same characteristics as the B horizons except they have silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam textures.  A few pedons have an E horizon."

Placentia soils have 15 to 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand and have hues redder than 10YR in the B horizon.  San Miguel soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 34 inches.  Stockpen soil has 15 to 20 percent gravel in the solum."

Elevations are 1,900 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  Frost-free season is 175 to 200 days."

This is a revision of the 1965 tentative description.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nNatric horizon- the zone from 2 to 61 inches (Bt, Bty1, Bty2, Bty3 horizons) Gypsic horizon- the zone from 18 to 39 inches (Bty2)\nSoil temperature is always above 47 degrees F.  These soils have a xeric bordering on aridic moisture regime.\nLast revised by the state on 8/85.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Samples from this pedon were sent to the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln Nebraska in 1984.  The pedon number is 84P 529.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
