    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)\nSeries control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches)\nMollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 18 inches (Ap, A1, and A2 horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nUdic moisture regime.\nThe concepts of moderately coarse and moderately fine substratum phases were established by the mlra-103 steering committee based on an analysis of particle size data from Iowa and Minnesota. The Des Moines Lobe till generally gets sandier and has less clay as one progresses south along the path of the Des Moines advance.\nBased on piezometer data from Iowa and Minnesota the Clarion series concept was changed to a soil that has soil saturation between 4 and 6 feet. Previously, Clarion soils did not have saturation above 6 feet.\nIn parts of MLRA-103 this drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual. Drainage class is a state interpretation."
