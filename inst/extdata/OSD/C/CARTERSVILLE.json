Fragments of shale and sandstone range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the profile.\nThe Ad horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3.  Texture is a loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 0.  The upper part of the Cr is slightly weathered and is penetrated by plant roots."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Kanima series and the tentative Blocker, Emachaya, Lequire and Whitefield series.  Kanima soils have more coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Lequire soils are more clayey than the Cartersville series and have Cd horizons.  Emachaya and Whitefield soils have depths of reclaim material over shale that are greater than 20 inches and are more clayey than the Cartersville series."

These soils formed in the pre-mine soils of the Hector, Enders, Linker, Naldo and Stigler series.  The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 45 inches."

Blocker soils are on steeper cutslope areas.  Lequire soils are on similar areas but have more clayey Cd horizons.  Emachaya and Whitefield soils are on less sloping areas and have clayey Cd horizons that are deeper over the shale material.  Kanima soils are on non-reclaimed areas."
