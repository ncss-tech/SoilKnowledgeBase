  "OVERVIEW": "The Cranbay series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
