The will classify as Mollic or Inceptic Haplocryalfs based on the thickness of the argillic horizon. These are Amesmont (WY), Beardall (UT), Bramard (ID), Dunlatop (CO), Hub (T WY), Moosegrove (T ID), Nisula (ID), Rimton (WY), Stringam (ID), Swapps (UT), Telcher (ID), Ula (CO) and Wix (CO) soils.  Amesmont, Beardall, Rimton, Swapps, Ula, and Wix soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bramard, Dunlatop, Hub, Moosegrove, Nisula, Stringam, and Telcher soils are noncalcareous throughout.  In addition, Bramard soils have umbric epipedons and are medium to very strongly acid, Dunlatop soils are medium or strongly acid, and Nisula soils have less than 5 percent rock fragment throughout."
