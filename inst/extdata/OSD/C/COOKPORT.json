    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belvoir, Buchanan, Calverton, Ernest, Glenville, Kedron and Raritan series in the same family.  The Califon, Clarksburg, Monongahela, Nolo, and Tilsit series are in related families.  Calverton and Ernest soils have less than 20 percent sand in the B2 horizons.  Belvoir soils have rock fragments of quartz and granodiorite in the control section.  Buchanan and Raritan soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Glenville soils lack sandstone fragments and have sola strongly influenced by micaceous rocks.  Kedron soils have hues of 5YR redder in the B horizon.  Califon and Monongahela soils lack redoximorphic depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Nolo soils have redoximorphic depletions immediately below the A or Ap horizon.  Tilsit soil has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cookport soils are on broad nearly level to gently sloping ridgetops and moderately steep sideslopes.  They developed in material weathered from interbedded sandstone, siltstone and in places, a minor component of shale.  The climate is humid cool temperate.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches and the growing season is 120 to 160 days."
