  "OVERVIEW": "The Cookport series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum weathered primarily from sandstone but includes some materials from shale and siltstone. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and low in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1270 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C.",
