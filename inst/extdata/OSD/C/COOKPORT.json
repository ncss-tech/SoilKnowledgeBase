  "OVERVIEW": "The Cookport series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum weathered primarily from sandstone but includes some materials from shale and siltstone. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The Califon, Clarksburg, Monongahela, Nolo, and Tilsit series are in related families.  Calverton and Ernest soils have less than 20 percent sand in the B2 horizons.  Belvoir soils have rock fragments of quartz and granodiorite in the control section.  Buchanan and Raritan soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Glenville soils lack sandstone fragments and have sola strongly influenced by micaceous rocks.  Kedron soils have hues of 5YR redder in the B horizon.  Califon and Monongahela soils lack redoximorphic depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Nolo soils have redoximorphic depletions immediately below the A or Ap horizon.  Tilsit soil has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section."
