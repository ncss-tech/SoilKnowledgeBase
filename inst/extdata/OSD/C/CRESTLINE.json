Adkins soils have carbonates and the calcic horizon at 24 to 40 inches. Atlanta soils have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the control section. The Bertelson, Declo, Escalante, and Strevell soils are calcareous to the surface. Briabbit soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock. Eoyote soils lack gravel in the control section. Kecko soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to secondary calcium carbonate and have 0 to 10 percent gravel in the control section. Sagehill soils are 10 to 30 inches deep to secondary calcium carbonate and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Somsen soils are moderately deep over hard bedrock. Strevell soils are 4 to 10 inches deep to secondary calcium carbonate and have Bk horizons with silt loam or loam textures of the fine earth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crestline soils are on alluvial fans, relict longshore bars, inset fans, fan skirts, fan remnants and alluvial flats at elevations of 4,900 to 6,400 feet. Slope ranges form 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks including sandstone, welded tuff, rhyolite, andesite, and basalt. The climate is semiarid, and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F, and the freeze-free period ranges from 100 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Antelope Springs, Biblesprings, Escalante and Sevy soils. Antelope Springs soils have natric horizons and occur in lower positions on alluvial plains. Biblesprings soils are calcareous throughout and have a calcic horizon that contains appreciable secondary silica. Escalante soils are calcareous throughout and do not have a cambic horizon. Sevy soils have an argillic horizon. These soils are intermixed on the landscape with the Crestline soils."
