Rock fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 44 to 47 degrees F. and a mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches of about 59 to 64 degrees F.  They are dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous in the A and Bt horizons but are slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous in the Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has colors the same as the A horizon and textures range from very gravelly loam and very cobbly loam to very gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam with about 23 to 32 percent clay.\nThe BC and Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are very gravelly, very cobbly, and very stony loam."

Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum on intermediate volcanic rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 75 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."
