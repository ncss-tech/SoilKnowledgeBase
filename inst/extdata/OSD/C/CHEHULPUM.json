Depth to semiconsolidated bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The pscs has 18 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent paragravel.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 5 to 35 percent paragravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chehulpum soils are on low hills at elevations of 200 to 1,200 feet. The soils formed in colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks mixed with silty glaciolacustrine deposits at elevations below 400 feet. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The average July temperature is 67 degrees F. and average January temperature is 39 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Dupee soils are greater than 40 inches to a paralithic contact and are on footslopes and concave parts of hillslopes. Hazelair soils are fine and have redox depletions within 30 inches of the surface and are on concave parts of hillslopes. Steiwer soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact and are on the linear parts of hillslopes. Willakenzie soils are fine-loamy, do not have a mollic epipedon and are on low hills. Yamhill soils are fine, have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and occur over basalt on low hills."
