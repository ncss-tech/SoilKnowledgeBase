  "OVERVIEW": "The Cucho series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from shale and are on cuestas and fan terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
