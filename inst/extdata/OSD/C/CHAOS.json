  "OVERVIEW": "The Chaos series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in rockfall avalanche deposits from rhyodacite. Chaos soils are on rockfall avalanches from Chaos Crags. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches (1092 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6.5 degrees C).",
