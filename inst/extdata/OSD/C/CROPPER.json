  "OVERVIEW": "The Cropper series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, welded tuff, and rhyolite. Cropper soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
