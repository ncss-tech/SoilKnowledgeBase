  "OVERVIEW": "The Coland series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans in river valleys and upland drainageways in dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.",
