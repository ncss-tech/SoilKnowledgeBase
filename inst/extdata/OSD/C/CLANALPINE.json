  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clanalpine soils are on mountains.  They occur on backslope positions with mainly north aspects. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,980 to 2,740 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
