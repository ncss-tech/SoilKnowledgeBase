  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Carp Lake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey till on depressional areas of moraines and till plains.  These soils have very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
