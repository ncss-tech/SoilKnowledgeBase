The soils formed in marine deposits from mixed sources.  Elevations are 4 to 183 meters (10 to 600 feet).    A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."
