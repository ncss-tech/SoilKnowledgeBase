  "OVERVIEW": "The Candymountain series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in marine deposits from mixed sources.  Candymountain soils are on uplifted marine terraces and hillslopes on slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
