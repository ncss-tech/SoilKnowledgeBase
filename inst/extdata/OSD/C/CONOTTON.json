  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 35 to greater than 80 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to greater than 80 inches. Rock fragments are glacial erratics, predominantly of sandstone, siltstone and quartz. Rock fragments of shale and granitic lithology may also be present. Thin strata less than three inches thick that have more or less gravel are permitted throughout the profile. The subhorizons in the particle-size control section contain 6 to 22 percent clay and the particle size control section averages less than 18 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Undisturbed pedons have A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 34 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 2 to 7 inches thick that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is coarse sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 34 percent. It ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 40 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 7.5YR and less commonly 10YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam with subhorizons of sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. In some pedons, a waxy transitional subhorizon having value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 is just above the contact with the underlying C horizon. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has a color range like the Bt horizon. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine earth fraction. In some pedons, waxy \"beta\" horizon having value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 is just above the contact with the underlying C horizon. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR and less commonly 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction. It is typically stratified. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have carbonates, but have a low calcium carbonate equivalent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dorerton, Hawksbill, Leoni, Lutzke, Oakhill, and Silverwood series. Dorerton soils have carbonates at 16 to 45 inches. Hawksbill soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick and developed in alluvium or colluvial material derived from greenstone, sandstone, and phyllite. Oakhill soils are less than 60 inches to a lithic contact. Leoni, Lutzke, and Silverwood soils average between 18 and 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."

Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F."

Chili, Negley, Oshtemo, and Wheeling soils are on similar landscape positions and contain less gravel. Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, Hazleton, and Westmoreland soils are on interfluves, head slopes, nose slopes, and side slopes on nearby unglaciated uplands. Canfield, Ellsworth, Mahoning, Rittman, Swartswood, Wadsworth, and Wooster soils are on interfluves and side slopes on nearby till plains. Chagrin, Holly, Lobdell, Orrville, and Tioga soils are on nearby flood plains. Halsey and Red Hook formed in glaciofluvial deposits on level or nearly level terraces."
