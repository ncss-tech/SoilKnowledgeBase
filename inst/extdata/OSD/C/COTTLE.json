  "OVERVIEW": "The Cottle series consists of shallow, well drained soils on foothills.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff or related rocks.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the average annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Atlow soils are moderately to strongly alkaline in the argillic horizon and lack evidence of secondary silica.  Boomstick, Olac and Soughe soils are noncalcareous in all parts.  Checkett, Hooplite, and Stewval soils are calcareous in all parts.  Gabbvally soils are noncalcareous throughout and have average annual soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Old Camp soils receive summer moisture in the form of convection storms.  Phliss soils are calcareous in all parts of the argillic horizon and lack secondary silica.  Rowel soils have an argillic horizon with 40 to 55 percent clay.  Thike soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic."
