  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is typically calcareous to the surface but is leached a few inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle size control section is from 10 to 40 inches in this soil and has a matrix of loam or sandy loam modified with 2 - Clifsand Series\n30 to 70 percent pebbles and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 5 to 18 percent with sand ranging from 40 to 80 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The surface may be covered with from 15 to 50 percent lag gravel.\nThe Bk1 or Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where a Bw horizon is present, it is calcareous throughout.  The Bk1 horizon is not normally part of the diagnostic calcic horizon but may be depending on position and carbonate content.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk2 horizon has a hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  This horizon is a diagnostic calcic horizon with from 8 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Reaction is moderately and strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  Autogenetic carbonate is typically present and ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline."

Blackston soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the upper part of the control section and have sand and gravel at 20 to 40 inches.  The Utaline soils have 18 to 35 percent clay throughout the control section.  Bock soils formed in materials weathered from basalt."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Clifsand soils are on old terraces, hillslopes, ridge crests, and dissected fan aprons.  Slopes are both complex and simple and range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 9 inches with about half falling as snow and rain in April, May, and June.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,200 feet.  The frost-free season is estimated to be about 110 to 130 days."
