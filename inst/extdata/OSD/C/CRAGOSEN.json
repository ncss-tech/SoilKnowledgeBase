  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 degrees F. and ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F.  The mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos throughout the soil.  Exchangeable sodium is estimated to be between 0 and 12 percent.  The particle size control section matrix is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 15 to 25 percent clay and 30 to 60 percent sand with 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragment content of the control section ranges from 25 to 45 percent pebbles and 5 to 15 percent cobble and averages over 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral through strongly alkaline.  Neutral and mildly alkaline reactions occur in the presence of gypsum that acts as a buffering agent.\nThe C or Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction ranges from mildly through strongly alkaline.  The mildly alkaline reaction occurs in the presence of gypsum.  A Bw or Bk horizon may replace part or all of the C horizon but is not diagnostic of either a cambic or calcic horizon.  The carbonate movement, while common in some pedons, is not consistent and, though pedogenic, does not meet the requirement for a diagnostic horizon.\nThe 2Cr horizon consists of varicolored shales interbedded with semiconsolidated siltstone and sandstone.  The material is soft with thin, discontinuous lenses of consolidated rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this class.  The Blazon, Colhill, Grobutte, and Highpoint soils are similar.  Blazon soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section.  Colhill and Grobutte soils are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock.  The Highpoint soils are lime- free and have a nonacid reaction class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cragosen soils are on fan aprons, footslopes, shoulders, and crests of ridges and hills.  These soils formed in slopewash alluvium over sandstone controlled uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent and are both simple and complex.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches but ranges from 9 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow and rain during April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. but ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 100 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
