They formed in gravelly and cobbly sandy alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly granitic sources. The climate is cool continental. Mean annual precipitation varies from 635 to 1524 millimeters. Cold water from snow melt keeps the soil temperature below 15 degrees C throughout the summer. The mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C, mean January temperature is -3 degrees C, and mean July temperature is 15 degrees C. The frost-free season is 25 to 100 days."
