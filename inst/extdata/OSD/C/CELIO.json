  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Celio soils are on nearly level to gently sloping glacial outwash at elevations of 1860 to 2075 meters. They formed in gravelly and cobbly sandy alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly granitic sources. The climate is cool continental. Mean annual precipitation varies from 635 to 1524 millimeters. Cold water from snow melt keeps the soil temperature below 15 degrees C throughout the summer. The mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C, mean January temperature is -3 degrees C, and mean July temperature is 15 degrees C. The frost-free season is 25 to 100 days."

Tahoe and Marla soils are poorly drained with the Tahoe soils on flood plains and Marla in and around the flood plain.  Meeks soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on moraines."
