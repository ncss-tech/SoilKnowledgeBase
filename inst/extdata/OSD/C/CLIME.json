Updated cation exchange activity class to active based on laboratory data collected near the type location.\n01/2012 JLG Up-dated to meet MO5 Soil Technical Note-1 (Revision 4); conversion from English to metric; added the following: longitude and latitude to typical pedon, particle-size control section, sand and clay ranges, calcium carbonate equivalent based on lab data, mean annual soil temperature and soil moisture in characteristics, elevation, precipitation patterns, frost-free days, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Land Resource Region, Taxonomic Version, a couple of diagnostic features, lab samples under additional data, and soil moisture. Broaden range of mean annual precipitation; Removed Thornthwaites Annual PE Index.\n6/2020 BKN updated some tabular RIC data. Changed Keys to Taxonomy version to Twelfth Edition.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A pedon was sampled from the general area as the typical pedon described here for analysis. The data is listed under National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska Numbers 79P1655 - 79P1658 (pedon 79KS017001). Addition laboratory data- Kansas State University Characterization Laboratory, Manhattan, Kansas sample numbers KSUSS2844-KSUSS2846 (88KS061014) and KSUR0542-KSUR0548 (97KS161036). http://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/rptExecute.asp?p=7411&r=1&submit1=Get+Report\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
