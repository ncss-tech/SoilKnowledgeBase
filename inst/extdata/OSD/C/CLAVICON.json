    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist about 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 5 to 16 inches.  The particle size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate, and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 20 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to l0 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  The A horizon is slightly calcareous to moderately calcareous and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam.  It is moderately calcareous to very strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is l3 to l6 inches. The freeze-free period is 75 to l00 days."

The Kunzler soils have 15 to 25 percent durinodes within 24 inches and are on lower, flat and concave portions of bajadas. The Lembos soils have a duripan within 40 inches and are on upper flat and slightly convex portions of bajadas.  The Lundy soils are shallow to bedrock, and average more than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the calcareous class control section and are on steep hillslopes.  Solok soils are shallow to bedrock and are on convex mountainsides."
