  "OVERVIEW": "The Clavicon series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite.  These soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist about 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 5 to 16 inches.  The particle size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate, and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 20 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to l0 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  The A horizon is slightly calcareous to moderately calcareous and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam.  It is moderately calcareous to very strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."
