  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil has a permanent high water table at or near the surface and fluctuates with the tides unless diked and drained.  Extreme high tides and high tides along with peak freshwater flows inundate the soil unless protected by dikes or levees.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. Depth to the massive dark gray 2Cg horizon is 24 to 50 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Under natural conditions soil pH is moderately acid to neutral.  When diked and drained soil pH is extremely acid to very strongly acid, but may be strongly acid to moderately acid below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay.  In some pedons it has thin lenses of fibrous peat less than 4 inches thick or has thin sand layers. It has common or many distinct or prominent redox concentrations with 10YR to 5YR hue.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5BG, value of 2.5, 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or less moist and 2 or less dry.  It consists of bay sediments stratified with medium to fine textured materials and thin fine lenses of peat and coarse textured materials.  Some pedons have fine sand substratums below 40 inches.  It is loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 25 to 65 percent clay."

The soils formed in recent alluvium over massive bay sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  They are at elevations of 0 to 20 feet and are subject to tidal and freshwater overflow unless protected by dikes or levees.  The climate is characterized by cool moist summers and cool wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches.  The average July temperature is about 59 degrees F. the average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 245 days.  The soils are on the Ingram geomorphic surface."
