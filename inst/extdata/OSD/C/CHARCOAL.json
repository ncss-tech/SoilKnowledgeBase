  "OVERVIEW": "The Charcoal series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium or till. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, or moraines. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
