  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Coconino series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills of plateaus and mesas.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from calcareous sedimentary rock.  Slope is 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 degrees F.",
