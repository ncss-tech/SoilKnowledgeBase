  "OVERVIEW": "The Catfishbay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. The Catfishbay soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (about 3 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).",
