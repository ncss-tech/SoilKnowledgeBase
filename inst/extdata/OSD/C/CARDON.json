  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature at 20 inches is 62 degrees to 68 degrees F. The soil is generally saturated within 30 inches when not drained.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick. Deep cracking to depths of 40 to 55 inches and sloughing of the A horizons into cracks have caused a mixing of colors below the 10 to 15 inch depth. The soils have cracks that open and close once each year and remain open for 60 consecutive days or more in 7 out of 10 years.  Common medium distinct, yellowish brown mottles occur at depths below 20 inches. Reaction ranges moderately to strongly alkaline, and strongly calcareous. The series control section is clay or silty clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of less than 1.5. It contains 4 to 7.5 percent organic matter. This horizon has weak fine granular to moderate medium alkaline and contains more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe AC horizon has weak to moderate parallelepipeds structure and common to many slickensides.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, and 5 or 6 moist. It contains 30 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Obray soils have chroma of 2 or more in the surface horizons. Pit soils are noncalcareous in the upper 22 inches and lack mottles within 40 inches. Salt Lake and Logan soils have calcic horizons within 16 inches, and lack both parallelepipeds and slickensides and do not crack."

In uncultivated areas, gilgai microrelief is evident. The climate is dry subhumid; the average annual precipitation is about 14 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 67 degrees to 70 degrees F. Frost-free period is 120 to 130 days."
