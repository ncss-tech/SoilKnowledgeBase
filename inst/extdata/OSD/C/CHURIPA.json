    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Churipa soils are on beveled summits and shoulders of mesas.  They formed in alluvium derived from basalt, volcanic ash, and cinders. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 6,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calabasas, Medrano, Tetilla, and Tsinat soils. Calabasas soils are deep to petrocalcic horizons, are fine-silty, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus. Medrano soils are shallow to duripans, are loamy-skeletal, and occur on cinder cones. Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on toeslopes of undulating plateaus. Tsinat soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons, have calcic horizons, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 1 inch. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 1 to 13 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)\nDuripan and petrocalcic horizon - The zone from 17 to 30 inches. (Bkqm horizon)\nLithic contact - indurated basalt bedrock at 35 inches (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 1 to 13 inches (entire argillic horizon)\nNote: This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the very fine sand or fine sand fractions within 50 cm of the soil surface. It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony. In addition, Lincoln lab data on similar soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low. Typical totals of aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages are less than 0.20. Churipa soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S99NM-049-16. Reference analyses to determine if this soil has a duripan, petrocalcic horizon, or both are being performed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
