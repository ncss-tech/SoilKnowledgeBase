  "OVERVIEW": "The Churipa series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to duripan. Churipa soils formed in alluvium material derived from basalt, volcanic ash, and cinders. They are on beveled summits and shoulders of mesas. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 1 to 13 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)\nDuripan and petrocalcic horizon - The zone from 17 to 30 inches. (Bkqm horizon)\nLithic contact - indurated basalt bedrock at 35 inches (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 1 to 13 inches (entire argillic horizon)\nNote: This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the very fine sand or fine sand fractions within 50 cm of the soil surface. It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony. In addition, Lincoln lab data on similar soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low. Typical totals of aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages are less than 0.20. Churipa soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S99NM-049-16. Reference analyses to determine if this soil has a duripan, petrocalcic horizon, or both are being performed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
