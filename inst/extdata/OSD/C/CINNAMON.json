These soils are usually moist and dry less than 45 consecutive days in the moisture control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has weak fine granular or subangular blocky structure.  It has 10 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture (dry).\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure and has textures of loamy sand or sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or neutral.  It has 10 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture (dry).\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry.  It has medium to strong subangular blocky structure.   Texture is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 15 percent andesitic pebbles and 20 to 50 percent soft weathered pumice.  It has greater than 15 percent 15-bar moisture (dry).  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  In some pedons, the lower part of the 2Bw horizon below 40 inches is compacted or weakly cemented and is very hard or hard when dry."

Field test of NaF pH is less than 9.2 in the A; 11.5 in the Bw, and 12.0 in the 2Bwb horizon.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 1 percent.  Udivitrands feature - less than 12 percent 15-bar moisture (dry) throughout 90 percent of upper 60 cm.  More investigation is needed to confirm the medial classification of the \"B\" tephra set (2Bw).\nClassification change date 6/98 based on mineralogy class revision in Soil Taxonomy."
