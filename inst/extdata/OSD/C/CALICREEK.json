  "OVERVIEW": "The Calicreek series consists of very deep, well drained  soils on flood plains and low alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from granitic rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

The moisture regime is aridic but it borders on xeric.  Mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel average 15 percent or less, but gravelly strata are present in some pedons.  The particle size control section averages loamy sand to coarse sand with some finer textured strata.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in most areas.  In some areas, the surface has been acidified by the use of sulfur.\nThe Ap horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, or 4/3.  Texture is sandy loam or loamy coarse sand.  Effervescence is slight or absent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3 or 5/3.  The soil is stratified with texture of coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam and loam.  Gravelly strata are present in some pedons.  Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent and decreases irregularly with depth."

The climate is semiarid and has hot dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is 83 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 225 to 300 days."
