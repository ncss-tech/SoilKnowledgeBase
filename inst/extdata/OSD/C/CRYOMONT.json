The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 55 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume. The upper 4 to 6 inches has more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth-fraction.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist. It is stony ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 2 or 3 dry. It is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very cobbly stratified fine sandy loam and fine sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is extremely gravelly coarse sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely cobbly sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."
