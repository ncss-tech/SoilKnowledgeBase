The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 55 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume. The upper 4 to 6 inches has more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth-fraction.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist. It is stony ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 2 or 3 dry. It is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very cobbly stratified fine sandy loam and fine sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is extremely gravelly coarse sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely cobbly sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cryomont soils are on low terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in alluvium capped with a very thin layer of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,600 feet. These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 75 inches. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F, and the average July temperature is about 59 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees is 100 to 130 days."
