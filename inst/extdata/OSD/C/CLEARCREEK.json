  "OVERVIEW": "The Clearcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on flood plains and low stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation is 2,500 to 3,000 feet. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
