  "OVERVIEW": "The Cliff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Cliff soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
