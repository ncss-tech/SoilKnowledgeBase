The 12/2025 revision changed the format.  No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 10 to 152 centimeters (4 to 60 inches) (Bw horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 61 centimeters (24 inches) of the soil, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year"
