  "OVERVIEW": "The Coyne series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in loamy wind-or water-deposited sediments and the underlying loamy lacustrine sediments on stream terraces. The substratum is sandy or gravelly sediments.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

They also are in the ancient Mississippi River valley known locally in Rock Island and Whiteside Counties, Illinois, as the Meredosia Slough. These soils formed in about 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loamy wind- or water-deposited sediments and the underlying loamy or clayey lacustrine sediments that had their origin from the hemitite-rich rocks of the Lake Superior region. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 813 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches)."

Joslin soils contain more clay and less sand in the upper part of the solum and have the argillic horizon in the wind- or water-deposited sediments in the upper part of the solum. Trempealeau soils have reddish colors throughout the B horizon and are underlain by sandy sediments at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches).
