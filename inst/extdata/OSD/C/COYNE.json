  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on terraces primarily in the Mississippi River valley and in a few tributary valleys. They also are in the ancient Mississippi River valley known locally in Rock Island and Whiteside Counties, Illinois, as the Meredosia Slough. These soils formed in about 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loamy wind- or water-deposited sediments and the underlying loamy or clayey lacustrine sediments that had their origin from the hemitite-rich rocks of the Lake Superior region. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 813 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Dickinson soils on nearby terrace ridges and the Joslin, Trempealeau, and Sparta soils on similar positions on the landscape.  Joslin soils contain more clay and less sand in the upper part of the solum and have the argillic horizon in the wind- or water-deposited sediments in the upper part of the solum. Trempealeau soils have reddish colors throughout the B horizon and are underlain by sandy sediments at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches).  Sparta soils contain more sand\nthroughout the profile."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the wind or water-deposited sediments, moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the lacustrine sediments, and high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the underlying materials. Permebility is moderately rapid in the wind or water-deposited sediments, moderately high in the lacustrine sediments, and rapid in the underlying materials."
