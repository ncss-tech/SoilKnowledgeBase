Bogart, Centerburg, Haney, Jenera, Jugtown, Nicely, Scattersville, Swampoodle, Thackery, Tuscola, and Vanlue soils do not have a densic contact within the series control section. Cygnet soils formed in 102 to 152 cm of loamy glaciolacustrine material containing up to 30 percent rock fragments above the underlying till. Houcktown soils formed in 51 to 102 cm of loamy water-sorted material containing up to 25 percent rock fragments above the underlying till. Passport soils are more than 152 cm to carbonates. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm. Vallonia soils have less than 10 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Williamstown soils are dominated by rock fragments of limestone or crystalline lithology."

The poorly drained Brookston and Parkhill soils and moderately well drained Miami soils are in a drainage sequence with the Conover soils and are the most common associates. The very poorly drained Carlisle soils formed in organic materials and are in depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Crosier soils occupy landscape positions similar to the Conover soils and have dominant colors with chroma 2 or less in the upper part of the subsoil."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm below the surface at some time from September to May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low in the surface horizon and upper part of the subsoil, moderately low or low in the lower part of the subsoil, and very low or low in the dense till."

Further study on the depth to low chroma redoximorphic features will be required to differentiate these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from the typical pedon 18N0101, samples 18N00644-650 from Shiawassee County, Michigan, is available from the NRCS-NSSC-Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE, 07/2018.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
