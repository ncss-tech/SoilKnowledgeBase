  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cochedome series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
