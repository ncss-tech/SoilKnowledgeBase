  "BYREV": "Rev. LDG-CJM-RJE",
  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Carstairs series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and volcanic ash. Carstairs soils are on glacial outwash terraces at elevations of l00 to 500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of l2 and 35 inches for about 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has chroma of l or 2 moist or dry.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry or moist."
