Cieneba soils have 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand and have Cr horizons comprised of acid granitic material. Gillander soils have AC horizons and have influence in the profile of small amounts of ash. Trigo series have Cr horizons comprised of consolidated stratified alluvial sediments and can have 2.5Y colors within the profile."
