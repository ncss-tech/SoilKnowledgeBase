  "OVERVIEW": "The Chumash soils consist of very shallow and shallow to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Chumash soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Cieneba soils have 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand and have Cr horizons comprised of acid granitic material. Gillander soils have AC horizons and have influence in the profile of small amounts of ash. Trigo series have Cr horizons comprised of consolidated stratified alluvial sediments and can have 2.5Y colors within the profile."
