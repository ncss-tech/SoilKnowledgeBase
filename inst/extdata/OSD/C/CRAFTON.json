From mid-May until mid-November, the soils are usually continuously dry.  The rest of the year the soils are usually moist in some or all parts between depth of 10 and 30 inches.  Organic carbon is more than 0.6 percent to a depth of 10 to 19 inches.  The particle size control has 8 to 18 percent clay.  The soil is slightly acid or moderately acid and base saturation ranges from 75 to 90 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, brown or dark brown (10YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 3/3).  Moist colors are very dark grayish brown, or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 3/2).  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and contains 0 to 15 percent fine gravel.\nThe C1 horizon is brown, yellowish brown, or dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/8, 4/4, 4/6, 3/4) sandy loam that contains up to 20 percent gravel.\nThe C2r horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown or light olive brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4; 2.5YR 5/4, 5/6)."
