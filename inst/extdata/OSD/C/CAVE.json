  "OVERVIEW": "The Cave series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Cave soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
