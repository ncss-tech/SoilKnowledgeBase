These soils formed in alluvium derived from shale, chert, limestone and dolomite that has been worked by wave action, with some local loess deposition. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,770 to 1,925 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid continental. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, most of which falls as snow; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the mean summer temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C.   The frost free season is 70 to 110 days."
