  "OVERVIEW": "The Credo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lake deposits derived from shale, chert, limestone and dolomite with local loss deposition.  Credo soils are on beach terraces. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
