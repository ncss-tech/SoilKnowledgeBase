  "OVERVIEW": "The Coweta series consists of shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained soils on interfluves and hillslopes. They formed in material weathered from residuum from sandstone inter-bedded with shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1040 mm (41 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F.).",
