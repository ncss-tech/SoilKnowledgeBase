The soils formed in residuum weathered from soft sandstone interbedded with shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1140 mm (35 to 45 inches).  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C. (57 to 64 degrees F.).  Frost free period is 170 to 235 days.  Elevation is 140 to 340 meters (459 to 1115 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 64 to 80."
