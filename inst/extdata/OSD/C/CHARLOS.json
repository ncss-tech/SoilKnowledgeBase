  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to very gravelly substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Medium and coarse granitic sands are distributed through the solum, ranging in weight from 20 to 60 percent.  Rounded granitic pebbles and cobbles ranges from 2 to 30 percent in the A and Bt horizons.  The soil pedon is noncalcareous except in a few pedons where hardened lime coats the underside of cobbles and large pebbles in the very gravelly sand substratum.  The soil is moderately acid to neutral.  Hue is 10YR through 5YR.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 degrees to 46 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature ranges from 55 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bt horizon has moist value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is coarse sandy loam to clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay and 12 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  The clay type is an expanding type with about 90 milliequivalents exchange capacity per 100 grams of clay.   Dry consistence of individual peds ranges from hard to extremely hard and moist consistence ranges from friable to firm.  Structure ranges from weak to medium prismatic and weak to medium blocky.  There is weak to strong clay bridging of sand grains on faces of peds and clay films occur throughout peds."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils occur at elevations ranging from 4,500 to 8,000 feet in a cold subhumid climate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 to 21 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 degrees to 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 50 to 110 days."
