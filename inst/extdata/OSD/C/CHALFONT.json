    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 3 1/2 to 8 feet or more.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The silty mantle (loess material) is usually 30 to 50 inches thick.  Rock fragments of shale or sandstone range from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 15 to 60 percent in the 2B and 2C horizons.  Reaction of the soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8, and have distinct high and low chroma mottles.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bx horizon above the 2Bx1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6, and has distinct mottles.  Faces of prisms are neutral or have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 or 1.  Structure is very coarse prismatic parting to platy or subangular blocky.\nThe 2B and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.

Gudgel, Sciotoville, and Skakamak soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the subsoil (B or 2B horizons). Haubstadt, Nabb, and Plumfield soils have a solum thickness of more than 60 inches.  Pierpont, Robbs, and Sciotoville soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section."

Abbottstown, Chester, Croton, Lansdale, Penn, and Readington are associated soils which do not have the loess mantle.  Abbottstown, Penn, and Readington soils have B horizons with hue of 5YR or redder.  Croton soils have colors with chroma of 2 or less immediately below the A horizon.  Chester, Lansdale, and Penn soils are well drained and do not have a fragipan."

    "content": "REMARKS: The 11/2005 revision places Chalfont soils in an active family based on similar soils with similar parent material. The pedon description was updated to current horizon nomenclature and redoximorphic feature terminology. Competing series section was also updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 inches to a depth of 27 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Btx horizons).\nc.  Fragipan - the zone from 21 inches to a depth of 57 inches (Btx, Bxg, 2Bx1 and 2Bx2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available for the series.  Samples were taken from Bucks County, Pennsylvania S68Pa-09-6 (1-8) and S68Pa-09-7 (1-9).\nMLRA: 130, 148 and the northern fringe of 149A\nREVISED: 07/86-GDM; 12/2005-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
