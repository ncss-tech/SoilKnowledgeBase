  "OVERVIEW": "The Cotter series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium on nearly level high floodplains and old natural levees along major streams.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

Ashdale soils have 2B horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  Assumption, Dana, Dinsdale, Saybrook and Sidell soils have 2B horizons with more than 15 percent sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Barrington soils have carbonates at shallow depths.  Broadwell soils have thinner mollic epipedons and have loamy sand or sand at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Catlin, Douglas, Elkhart, Elmont, Harrison, Healing, Keltner, Malcolm, Mendota, Ogle, Plano, Richwood, Procter, Tama, Toddville, Wakenda soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick.  Reading soils contain more clay in the lower solum and C horizons.  Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Tama soils have a thinner mollic epipedon and more uniform coarse silt to fine silt ratio.  Troxel soils have mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches of 47 to 54 degrees F and commonly have loamy outwash in the lower part of the solum.  Wiota soils contain more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the Bt horizon."
