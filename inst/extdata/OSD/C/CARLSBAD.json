  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 24 to 40 inches.  Usually the soil between the depths of 12 and 35 inches is continuously moist in some part from about December 1 until May and is dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches depth is about 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand or light sandy loam and has 5 to 35 percent iron concretions 2 to 8mm in diameter.  This horizon is slightly or medium acid.  The upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is slightly to strongly acid.  The lower part of the C horizon is weakly cemented to indurated.  It is brittle when moist, it may soften when wet, but does not slake in water or HC1."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carlsbad soils are gently sloping to moderate steep and are at elevations of 30 to 300 feet.  They formed in marine terraces that almost parallel the coast.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with dry somewhat foggy summers and moist cool winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, average January temperature is 55 degrees F, and average July temperature is 69 degrees F.  the average frost-free season is 330 to 350 days."

Alo soils are clayey soils developed on shale.  Corralitos soils are very deep alluvial soils.  Las Flores soils have clay subsoils.  Marina, Salinas, and Tujunga soils lack iron concretions and duripans."
