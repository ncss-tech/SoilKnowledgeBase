  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Minimal thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches depending on surface soil texture.  The control section is gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand or sand.  Within the sand fraction the content of medium and coarser angular sand having a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains ranges from 15 to about 90 percent and horizons of low organic matter content have a differential between dry and moist consistence that is 1 to 3 times greater than soils of similar texture having finer and more rounded sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 35 to about 75 percent and are mainly 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The control section of some pedons has a few faint mottles with the chroma of both matrix and mottles exceeding."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chaseville and Dix series.  Chaseville soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Dix soils have more rounded and finer sand grains, have rock fragments that are more rounded and of larger size, and lack hard-setting characteristics when dry."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Columbine soils are on terraces, flood plains, alluvial fans, and concave drainageways.  Slopes range from about 0 to 10 percent.  The soil formed in thick, noncalcareous, coarse textured, alluvial materials washed from arkose deposits and exposures of granite.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 68 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 140 days."
