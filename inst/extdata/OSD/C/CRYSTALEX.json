  "OVERVIEW": "The Crystalex series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in wind-modified alluvium and/or outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
