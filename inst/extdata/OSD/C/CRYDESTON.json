  "OVERVIEW": "The Crydeston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from sedimentary sources.  Crydeston soils are in mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 7.0 degrees C.",
