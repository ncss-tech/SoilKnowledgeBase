  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarknoll series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from siltstone and sandstone.  Cedarknoll soils are on hill slopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
