    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches), but may be thinner on eroded pedons. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 in). Depth to carbonates is 127 to 254 cm (50 to 100 in). Content of rock fragments, dominantly sandstone but including shale and some crystalline rocks, ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume above the fragipan, 2 to 25 percent in the fragipan and 2 to 34 percent below the fragipan. Base saturation is more than 60 percent at a depth of 76 cm (30 in) below the upper boundary of the fragipan. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some uncultivated pedons have an A horizon 3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Unless limed, the A or Ap horizon commonly is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon is mixed in the Ap in some cultivated areas. Where present, the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Unless limed, it is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or loam, or their gravelly analogues. Unless limed, it is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6; and redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less above the fragipan and within the upper 10 inches of the Bt or 2Bt. It is commonly loam or silt loam, or their gravelly analogues but thin subhorizons with clay loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Btx or 2Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. It is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThere is a BC or 2BC horizon in some pedons that is similar to the Btx or 2BTx horizons, but is not brittle.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

The Wooster soils are on similar positions and the Ravenna and Frenchtown soils are on lower topographic positions or are on less sloping areas along drainageways. The Bogart and well drained Chili soils are on nearby areas of gravelly outwash."

The series is extensive.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Trumbull County, Ohio, 1917.\nREMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap, BE).\n2. Argillic horizon - 23 to 114 cm (9 to 45 in) (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Btx1,2Btx2).\n3. Fragipan - 66 to 114 cm (26 to 45 in) (2Btx1, 2Btx2).\n4. Redoximorphic features - 15 to 114 cm (6 to 45 in).\nA moderately shallow to bedrock phase has been recognized. This phase will need to be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\nCanfield that was previously mapped in New York has been correlated to Mardin in survey areas that have been updated. In old survey areas in NY which haven't been updated, Canfield remains in the legend. As of 2014 a future project has been established in NASIS to investigate these areas, as well as areas in Columbia County, PA which are geographically separated from the main concentration of Canfield soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Canfield series can be found at the NCSS KSSL Soil Characterization Database. This includes data from the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
