  "OVERVIEW": "The Canfield series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age till on plains. In some pedons there is a thin loess mantle. Saturated hydraulic conductivity  is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1065 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 in). Depth to carbonates is 127 to 254 cm (50 to 100 in).

Base saturation is more than 60 percent at a depth of 76 cm (30 in) below the upper boundary of the fragipan. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some uncultivated pedons have an A horizon 3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Unless limed, the A or Ap horizon commonly is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon is mixed in the Ap in some cultivated areas. Where present, the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Unless limed, it is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or loam, or their gravelly analogues.

The series is extensive.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Trumbull County, Ohio, 1917.\nREMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap, BE).\n2. Argillic horizon - 23 to 114 cm (9 to 45 in) (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Btx1,2Btx2).\n3. Fragipan - 66 to 114 cm (26 to 45 in) (2Btx1, 2Btx2).\n4. Redoximorphic features - 15 to 114 cm (6 to 45 in).\nA moderately shallow to bedrock phase has been recognized. This phase will need to be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\nCanfield that was previously mapped in New York has been correlated to Mardin in survey areas that have been updated. In old survey areas in NY which haven't been updated, Canfield remains in the legend. As of 2014 a future project has been established in NASIS to investigate these areas, as well as areas in Columbia County, PA which are geographically separated from the main concentration of Canfield soils."
