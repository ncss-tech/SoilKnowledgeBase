  "OVERVIEW": "The Cren series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash.  The Cren soils are on fan skirts, alluvial fans and terraces and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
