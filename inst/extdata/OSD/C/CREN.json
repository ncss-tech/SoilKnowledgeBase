These soils formed in alluvium derived  from mixed rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
