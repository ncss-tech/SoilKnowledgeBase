They formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.
