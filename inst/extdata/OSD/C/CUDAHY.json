  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cudahy soils are on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,500 feet.  Groundwater high in carbonates have strongly influenced these soils.  The climate is dry subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 67 to 73 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity) above the cemented horizon.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 2 feet (very shallow to moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between April and August.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 16 inches (A and Ak horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 6 to 23 inches (Ak and Bkg horizons).\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zone from 23 to 44 inches (Bkm1 and Bkm2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 24 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the A, Ak, and Bkg horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 23 inches (Bkg horizon and part of the Ak horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT.  The data is unpublished.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
