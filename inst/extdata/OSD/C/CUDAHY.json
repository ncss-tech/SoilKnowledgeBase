  "OVERVIEW": "The Cudahy series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Cudahy soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
