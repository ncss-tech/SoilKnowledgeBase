  "OVERVIEW": "The Campra series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from basalt with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  They are on canyon side slopes, short escarpments, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
