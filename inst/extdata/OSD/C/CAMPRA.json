    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Campra soils are on canyonsides, short escarpments, hills and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,100 to 3,400 feet (335 to 1036 meters).  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  These soils are formed in material weathered from basalt with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 45 inches (559 to 1143 mm) and the frost free period is 50 to 120 days."
