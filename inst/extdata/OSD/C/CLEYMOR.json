  "OVERVIEW": "The Cleymor series consists of very deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from fine pyroclastic materials and basalt. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
