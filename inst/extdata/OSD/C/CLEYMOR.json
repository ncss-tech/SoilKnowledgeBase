LaPlatta soils have Bk horizons and the solum range from slightly to strongly alkaline. Mondey soils contain carbonates below argillic horizons and do not have an O horizon. Shar soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Streek soils have mollic epipedons 8 to 19 inches thick, do not have an O horizon and are moderately well drained. Wickiser soils do not have an O horizon nor slickensides and do have secondary carbonates at 30 to 44 inches."

These soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from fine pyroclastic materials and basalt. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 30 inches. The average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
