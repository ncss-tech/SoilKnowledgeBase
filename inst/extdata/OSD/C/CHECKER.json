  "OVERVIEW": "The Checker series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils in the valley basin.  They have very high concentrations of salts and alkali.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from sedimentary rock.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil is warmer than 47 degrees F from January 20 to December 1.  The soil between 16 and 48 inches is moist in all parts down to the capillary water table moisture from January 1 to May 1 and dry in all parts above the water table capillary fringe from July 1 to November 1.  The water table fluctuates between 36 and 48 inches of the surface in October through March.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 40 percent.  The EC ranges from 10 to 100 mmhos/cm, and the ESP ranges from 15 to 60.  The organic matter in the A horizon is less than 1 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/6 or 7/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4 or 6/4.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Disseminated lime ranges from none to violently effervescent and is always effervescent in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/6; 2.5Y 5/4, 6/6, 7/2, 7/4, 7/6; 5Y 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 8/2, 8/3.

It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay in the upper part.  The lower part is clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  In some pedons the lower part of the C horizon is loamy sand or clay.  Disseminated lime ranges from slightly to violently effervescent, and the reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."

They are being differentiated by having a Xeric moisture regime and being fine-loamy.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Soluble salts and exchangeable sodium determined by saturation extract.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by HC1, syringe field kit.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1.\nSeries reclassified 7/98, competing series not completed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
