The climate is cool maritime with mean annual precipitation of more than 80 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F, and the mean summer air temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 35 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 3 inches is about 39 degrees F.  The soils are seldom frozen."
