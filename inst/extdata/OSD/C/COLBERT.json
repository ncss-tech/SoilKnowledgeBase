  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 72 inches.  Reaction of the A and Bt horizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Reaction of the BC, CB, AND C horizons ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, silty loam, or silty clay loam.  Most pedons with silty clay loam A horizons are eroded.\nThe E horizon, where present, is less than 5 inches thick and has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same hue, value, and chroma range as the upper part of the Bt horizon with few to many mottles in varying shades of red, gray, and brown; or it is mottled in varying shades of yellow, red, gray, and brown.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe C, and, where present, the CB or BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Nodules of calcium carbonate, manganese concretions, and limestone fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume and are 2 to 30 mm in size.\nThe bedrock is hard limestone.  Some pedons have a thin shaly Cr horizon above the bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Colbert soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands of Limestone Valleys.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from agrillaceous limestone or shaly limestone.  Average annual temperature is 61 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 47 inches near the type location."

Barfield and Talbott soils are on either slightly higher elevation or adjacent side slopes and have bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Capshaw soils are on similar landforms but have mixed clay mineralogy.  Conasauga and Firestone soils are on either slightly higher elevations or adjacent side slopes and are underlain by soft shale bedrock.  Ketona and Tupelo soils are on lower landforms, have mixed clay mineralogy, and a shallower seasonal water table."
