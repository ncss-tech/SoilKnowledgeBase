  "OVERVIEW": "The Calemore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess derived primarily from sedimentary deposits. Calemore soils are on plains and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
