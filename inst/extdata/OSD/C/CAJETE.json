(A1, A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - from 15 to 33 inches. (Bw horizon). The total thickness of lamellae below the Bw horizon is presumed to be less than 15 cm and therefore not a cambic horizon.\nVitrandic feature - based on both the content of glass and the content of pumice throughout the upper 30 inches (A1, A2, Bw horizons).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A2, the Bw, and part of the E and Bt1 horizons).\nThe 6/2001 revision changes the classification from Ashy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Vitrandic Haplustepts to Ashy-pumiceous, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haplustolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Pedon S80NM-043-002 confirms the classification of the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
