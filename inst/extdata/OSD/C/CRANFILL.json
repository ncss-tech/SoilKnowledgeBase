  "REVDATE": "04/2022",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cranfill series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous colluvial sediments containing limestone gravel.  These soils are on foot slopes of ridges on hills. Slopes are dominantly 3 to 8 percent but range from 3 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
