The calcium carbonate equivalent of the control section ranges from 50 to 85 percent with silicate clay of 20 to 35 percent.  The texture throughout is gravelly loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Fragments of limestone mainly less than 3 inches across range from 15 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have horizons less than 7 inches thick with moist value of 3.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4."

Altoga soils have fine-silty control sections and less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Brackett soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick and a paralithic contact with limestone.  Cuthand, Karnes, Seawillow, Sunev, and Venus soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  In addition, Cuthand soils have coarse-silty control sections.  Karnes soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Sunev and Venus soils have mollic epipedons."

Slope gradients are dominantly 3 to 8 percent but range from 3 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous loamy colluvium containing limestone gravel.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 230 to 250 days and the elevation ranges from 800 to 1400 feet above sea level.  The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 46 to 56."

Brackett soils are on steeper slopes above Cranfill soils.  Seawillow soils are on stream terrace positions below Cranfill soils.  Denton soils have more than 35 percent clay, sola less than 40 inches thick and occupy higher lying uplands.  Eckrant and Purves soils have sola less than 20 inches thick and occupy higher lying shallow uplands.  Frio soils have thick mollic epipedons and occupy the flood plains. Krum soils have mollic epipedons, fine textured control sections and occupy concave positions in valleys below Cranfill soils.  Maloterre soils have sola less than 10 inches thick and occupy very shallow uplands below Cranfill soils."
