They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
