  "OVERVIEW": "The Cloudburst series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Cloudburst soils are on moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
