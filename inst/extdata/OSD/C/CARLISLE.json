  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Catden, Houghton, Lena, Peteetneet, Saltese, and Semiahmoo series. Catden soils have dominantly woody fibers in the bottom tier and have mean annual precipitation more than 1190 mm. Houghton soils formed primarily from herbaceous fibers and average less than 15 percent woody fragments in the control section. Lena soils have carbonates in the control section. Peteetneet, Saltese, and Semiahmoo soils have less than 15 percent woody fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carlisle soils are in depressions on lake plains, outwash plains, ground moraines, end moraines, recessional moraines, till plains, and flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in woody and herbaceous organic materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1194 mm (30 to 47 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 110 to 180 days. Elevation is 76 to 1158 meters (250 to 3,800 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adrian, Edwards, Granby, Lenawee, Linwood, Parkhill and Willette soils. Adrian, Edwards, Linwood, and Willette soils are very poorly drained and all occur in similar landscape positions, but have a mineral or limnic layer within the control section. Poorly drained or very poorly drained mineral soils such as Granby, Lenawee, and Parkhill occur in slightly higher landscape positions at the margins of Carlisle soils as they grade into the upland."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 61 cm (2.0 feet) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface from September to June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of these soils have been drained and are used for truck crops or pasture. Major crops include onions, potatoes, corn, radishes, celery, carrots, and lettuce. Some areas are used for small grains, hay, and sod production. The remaining portion is in woodland or cut-over woodland. Major tree species include American elm, white ash, black ash, red maple, swamp white oak, willow, tamarack, quaking aspen, and alder."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMuck (sapric material): from the surface to a depth of 152 cm (60 in) (Oa1, Oa2, Oa3 and Oa4 horizons).\nThis concept corresponds similarly to previous concepts of the Carlisle series, primarily in having developed from woody fibers. To define this woody characteristic as sapric material is difficult to do precisely. There does appear to be a definite difference in structure and a tendency toward brittleness in the aggregates developed from woody fibers vs. those developed from herbaceous fibers.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
