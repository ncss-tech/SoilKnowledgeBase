The A horizon and upper part of the BA horizon to a depth of about 10 inches typically have over one percent organic matter.  However, the dark colors are strongly parent material related below a depth of about 7 inches.  Many areas of taxadjuncts exist in mapping that have a mollic epipedon (Humic Xeric subgroup)."
