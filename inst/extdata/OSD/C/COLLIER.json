The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 60 inches, falling mostly as snow. The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

The A horizon and upper part of the BA horizon to a depth of about 10 inches typically have over one percent organic matter.  However, the dark colors are strongly parent material related below a depth of about 7 inches.
