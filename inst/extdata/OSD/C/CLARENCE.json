Rutland soils are on higher parts of the topography where the loess or silty material is thicker. The moderately well drained Chatsworth soils have an ochric epipedon and lack an argillic horizon. Mokena and Mona soils are on higher parts of the topography and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have part of their subsoil formed in loamy outwash. Nappanee soils lack a mollic epipedon and form a biosequence on nearby similar landforms. The poorly drained Rowe soils are on adjacent lower lying parts of the landscape and have water-sorted sediments in the upper 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of the profile. Rowe soils commonly are in a drainage sequence with Clarence soils."

An intermittent perched water table is at a depth 30 to 61 centimeters (1.0 to 2.0 feet) below the surface during January through May in normal years, but these soils still have a deficit of available water for crops during the summer. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very low to moderately low (0.0 to 0.42 micrometers per second). The available water capacity is low. Permeability is very slow"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: As a result of a characterization study of some soils on fine textured tills in northeastern Illinois, Clarence soils are classified as fine, illitic, mesic Aquic Argiudolls. The data from the characterization study indicate that Clarence soils have clay content less than 60 percent and low available water capacity due to the high bulk density of the B and C horizons. These soils are not considered to have an aquic moisture regime at suborder level of soil taxonomy because conditions are not right for reduction to occur. The wetness during late winter and early spring is caused by very slow permeability. The soils are not saturated for significant periods at a time when the soil temperature is above biologic zero.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipdon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 74 centimeters (11 to 29 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon is S77IL-075-9 from the characterization study of soils formed in fine textured materials in northeastern Illinois. NSSL Nos. 77P2646 - 77P2651.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
