The mollic epipedon is 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick. The average clay content of the particle-size control section is 50 to 60 percent, but some subhorizons may contain as little as 45 percent. The content of coarse fragments is low, commonly less than 5 percent in the series control section.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silty clay loam, but in some pedons it is silt loam or silty clay. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4 in the upper part and 2 to 6 in the lower part. Chroma of 2 is either in the matrix or in redoximorphic features. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part and is silty clay or clay in the lower part. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and is neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons are slightly to strongly effervescent in the lower part. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe BC, BCg, BCt, or BCtg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has redoximorphic features which have value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 6. It is silty clay or clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates. Moist bulk density is 1.7 g/cc or greater and is restricting to penetration of roots and water.\nThe Cd or Cdghorizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6. It is silty clay or clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates. Consistence is very firm. Moist bulk density is 1.7 g/cc or greater and is restricting to penetration of roots and water."

Chenoa, Elliott, Martinton, Rutland, and Swygert soils average less 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have moderate or high available water capacity. Strole soils do not have a root restrictive layer."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C. (48 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1,016 millimeters (35 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 165 to 290 meters (540 to 950 feet) above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Rutland soils and the Chatsworth, Mokena, Mona, Nappanee, and Rowe soils. Rutland soils are on higher parts of the topography where the loess or silty material is thicker. The moderately well drained Chatsworth soils have an ochric epipedon and lack an argillic horizon. Mokena and Mona soils are on higher parts of the topography and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have part of their subsoil formed in loamy outwash. Nappanee soils lack a mollic epipedon and form a biosequence on nearby similar landforms. The poorly drained Rowe soils are on adjacent lower lying parts of the landscape and have water-sorted sediments in the upper 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of the profile. Rowe soils commonly are in a drainage sequence with Clarence soils."

An intermittent perched water table is at a depth 30 to 61 centimeters (1.0 to 2.0 feet) below the surface during January through May in normal years, but these soils still have a deficit of available water for crops during the summer. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very low to moderately low (0.0 to 0.42 micrometers per second). The available water capacity is low. Permeability is very slow"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: As a result of a characterization study of some soils on fine textured tills in northeastern Illinois, Clarence soils are classified as fine, illitic, mesic Aquic Argiudolls. The data from the characterization study indicate that Clarence soils have clay content less than 60 percent and low available water capacity due to the high bulk density of the B and C horizons. These soils are not considered to have an aquic moisture regime at suborder level of soil taxonomy because conditions are not right for reduction to occur. The wetness during late winter and early spring is caused by very slow permeability. The soils are not saturated for significant periods at a time when the soil temperature is above biologic zero.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipdon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 74 centimeters (11 to 29 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon is S77IL-075-9 from the characterization study of soils formed in fine textured materials in northeastern Illinois. NSSL Nos. 77P2646 - 77P2651.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
