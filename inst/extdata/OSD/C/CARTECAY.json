  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is slightly acid through strongly acid in the control section, but all pedons have pH of 5.5 or higher in some part. Thin strata of contrasting textures are throughout the soil. Clay content in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 8 to 18 percent and there is more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Mica flakes are few to many in all horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6; or hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have a surface layer with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4 that is less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 20 inches of the surface. In some pedons these horizons are mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or loamy sand with thin strata of coarser or finer material. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is mottled with colors in shades of gray, brown, and red. The Cg horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, sand, or loamy sand, and the gravel content ranges from 0 to 50 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Those in closely related families are the Buncombe, Chewacla, Congaree, Enoree, Iuka, Riverview, and Toccoa series. Buncombe soils have sandy control sections. Chewacla, Congaree, and Riverview soils are fine-loamy. Enoree soils have dominant color with chroma less than 3. Iuka soils have siliceous mineralogy. Toccoa soils lack gray mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cartecay soils are on nearly level flood plains in narrow valleys of streams in the Piedmont Plateau and adjoining MLRAs where streams flow from Piedmont. Slopes are mostly 0 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. The soil formed in thick loamy alluvial sediments. The average annual precipitation is about 48 to 57 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 58 to 65 degrees F."
