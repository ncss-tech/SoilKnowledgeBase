  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinacamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from volcanic mudflow breccia.  Chinacamp soils are on side slopes in canyons in Cascade foothills.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches, (965 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F, (15 degrees C).",
