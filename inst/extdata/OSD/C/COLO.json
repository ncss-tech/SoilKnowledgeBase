  "OVERVIEW": "The Colo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on floodplains, low stream terraces, alluvial fans, and upland drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.",
