Areas that have been limed range to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have discontinuous E or BE horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. Texture is silt loam, loam or their gravelly or channery analogues. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam or loam or their gravelly or channery analogues. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky, parting to weak thin platy in some pedons. Rock fragments range from 2 to 25 percent. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Vertical faces on prisms have coats in hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Structure is weak or moderate, very coarse prismatic, parting to weak or moderate, medium or coarse, angular or subangular blocky, or parting to thin or thick platy. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent. Reaction commonly is very strongly acid to slightly acid but some pedons are neutral in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.

The somewhat poorly drained Venango and the poorly drained Frenchtown and Mill soils are in a toposequence with Cambridge soils. The Blakeslee, Braceville, Chenango, Hoosic, and Red Hook soils formed in gravelly outwash deposits and are on nearby outwash plains and terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of about 5 cm (2 in) (O and A horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon  from a depth of 5 to 64 cm (2 to 25 in) (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and Bw4 horizons).\n3. Argillic horizon and fragipan - from a depth of 64 to 130 cm (25 to 51 in) (Btx1 and Btx2 horizons).\nA February, 2000 revision reclassified Cambridge soils from Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs, due to analysis of laboratory data and updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nThe sandstone substratum phase was correlated only in Ashtabula County, Ohio. It was correlated as Mitiwanga soil during the modernization soil survey of Ashtabula County.\nPart of the previous location description was incorrect. The location description has been corrected and expanded in the February, 2000 revision. In this current version, coordinates were revised from NAD27 to NAD83.\nAdditional study is needed on the Bw horizons as compared to the Bt horizons in such soils as Canfield and Rittman series to see if they are significantly different.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Cambridge series can be found in the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
