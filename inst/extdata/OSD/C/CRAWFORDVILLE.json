  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: After further review, since the Btss is 10 inches thick with a total depth of 25 inches, the aquertic (vertic properties, aquic) subgroup has been changed to albaquultic (abrupt textural change, base saturation between 35 and 60 percent, aquic) Very-high shrink-swell has been changed to high in the Btss.03/06. This series was formerly included with the Orange, Pittsboro, Sedgefield, Wilkes, and Wynott soils. Orange soils have smectitic minerology, paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, and are in the mesic soil temperature regime. Pittsboro soils do not have redoximorphic depletions of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Wilkes soils are well drained, and have paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Wynott soils are well drained.  The April 2007 only changed the status of this soil back to tentative.  This soil was never correlated in Virginia.  The 2012 change decreases the requirement of coarse fragments in the lower horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 21 inches (Bt horizon)\nAquic conditions - the soil has redoxomorphic depletions and concentrations within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nParalithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 25 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Georgia, Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Soil Characterization Lab, 1/22/01, pedon# SOOGA-265-001:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSoil Name           Slope   Airtemp   FrFr/Seas   Precip   Elevation\nCRAWFORDVILLE   2-25    60-64        214-225      46-50    340-660\nFloodL  FloodH  Watertable      Kind          Months     Bedrock   Hardness\nNONE                    1.0-1.5      PERCHED    OCT-APR    20-40     SOFT\nDepth     Texture          3-Inch    No-10      Clay%     -CEC-\n0-7         LS,LCOS,SL,COSL     0-5        90-100     5-15         2-10\n7-11        SCL, CL, SC, C            0-5\t  90-100    25-40        8-15\n11-21      C,SC                             0-10\t  95-100    40-60       15-30\n21-25     SCL, SC, GRSCL         0-10\t  85-100    25-40         5-15\n25-60    WB                                  -               -               -               -\nDepth\t      Permeab     Shnk-Swll\n0-7                 2.0-6.0       LOW\n7-11               0.6-2.0        MOD-HIGH\n11-21             0.0-0.06     HIGH\n21-25           0.06-0.2      MOD-HIGH\n25-60                  -                 -\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
