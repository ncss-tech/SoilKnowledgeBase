  "OVERVIEW": "The Comptche series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metamorphosed basalt.  Comptche soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick and has 1.0 to 6.5 percent organic carbon.  The lower Bt horizon averages less than 0.4 percent organic carbon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 to 22 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in some or all parts from July 15 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent gravel.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 85 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.  pH remains constant or decreases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 2.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  Moist color is 2.5YR 2.5/4, 3/4; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3.  Moist chromas of 4 occur only in the lower part of the horizon.  It is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay or very gravelly clay.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 50 percent.

The soils formed in material weathered from meta-basalt, consisting mostly of greenstone or pillow-basalt.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 220 to 320 days."
