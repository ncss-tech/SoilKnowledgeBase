  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Base saturation at the paralithic contact ranges from 35 to 60 percent. The weighted average clay content in the control section typically is about 24 percent and the content of sand coarser than very fine sand is about 44 percent. Sodium absorption ratio is less than 10 throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Where value is less than 3.5 thickness is less than 6 inches. Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nAn E horizon is present in some pedons. Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7,and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.  Thickness ranges up to 8 inches.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7,and chroma of 1 or 2. The B part has similar colors with mottles. The B part of the E/B horizon makes up about 10 to 40 percent by volume of the horizon. Texture is very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Btg/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations range from common to many in shades of brown. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Intrusions of albic materials into the horizon are mainly along vertical faces of peds. These intrusions are 2 to 30 mm wide and typically extend completely through the horizon. Filled crayfish burrows range from few to many.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles range from few to many in shades of brown. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Electrical conductivity ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mmhos/cm.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is firm, brittle tuffaceous siltstone or shale of clay loam or silty clay loam like texture. Widely scattered deposits of calcium carbonate and other white salts occur in fractures in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Vimville and Waller series in the same family, and the Alazan, Diboll, Elmina, Fuller, Gomery, Lelavale, Mollco, Mollville, Moten, and Myatt series in closely related families. Vimville and Waller soils do not have a paralithic contact to tuffaceous shale. Alazan soils do not have a paralithic contact, and have a yellower and browner subsoil. Diboll and Fuller soils have a natric horizon. Elmina and Gomery soils have a sandy surface layer more than 20 inches thick, are browner in the A2, and in addition, Gomery soils have less than 35 percent base saturation. Lelavale soils have a very deep solum and are extremely acid throughout. Mollco soils have a very deep solum. Mollville soils lack paralithic contact and have mixed mineralogy. Moten soils are in a coarse-loamy family and lack paralithic contact. Myatt soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colita soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in tuffaceous siltstone and shales of the Catahoula formation. The climate is subhumid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. Annual frost-free rainfall is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 70 degrees F. and the annual Thornthwaite P-E indices exceed 70."

Elmina and Moten soils are on similar landscape positions. Anacoco and Rayburn soils are on similar positions, but have a clayey argillic horizon and have a PLE greater than 6 cm. or form cracks within the upper meter. Kitterll soils are on steeper slopes and have a solum that is less than 14 inches thick over tuffaceous sandstones. Laska soils are on slightly convex ridges or mounds and are browner throughout."
