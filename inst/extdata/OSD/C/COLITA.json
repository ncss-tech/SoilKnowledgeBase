  "OVERVIEW": "The Colita series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. They formed from tuffaceous siltstones and shales of the Catahoula Formation. These soils have a perched water table near the surface in winter and early spring. Slope is dominantly about 2 percent but ranges from 0 to 5 percent.",

The weighted average clay content in the control section typically is about 24 percent and the content of sand coarser than very fine sand is about 44 percent. Sodium absorption ratio is less than 10 throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Where value is less than 3.5 thickness is less than 6 inches. Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nAn E horizon is present in some pedons. Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7,and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.  Thickness ranges up to 8 inches.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7,and chroma of 1 or 2. The B part has similar colors with mottles.

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Btg/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations range from common to many in shades of brown. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Intrusions of albic materials into the horizon are mainly along vertical faces of peds. These intrusions are 2 to 30 mm wide and typically extend completely through the horizon. Filled crayfish burrows range from few to many.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles range from few to many in shades of brown. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.

Vimville and Waller soils do not have a paralithic contact to tuffaceous shale. Alazan soils do not have a paralithic contact, and have a yellower and browner subsoil. Diboll and Fuller soils have a natric horizon. Elmina and Gomery soils have a sandy surface layer more than 20 inches thick, are browner in the A2, and in addition, Gomery soils have less than 35 percent base saturation. Lelavale soils have a very deep solum and are extremely acid throughout. Mollco soils have a very deep solum. Mollville soils lack paralithic contact and have mixed mineralogy. Moten soils are in a coarse-loamy family and lack paralithic contact. Myatt soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."
