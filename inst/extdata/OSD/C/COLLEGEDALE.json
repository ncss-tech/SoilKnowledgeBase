  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to limestone bedrock exceed 60 inches. The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except the surface layer where limed. Amount of chert gravel or shale channers ranges from none to about 10 percent by volume in each horizon. Most commonly, chert fragments are less than 2 inches across and are concentrated in the A horizon and the uppermost layer of the B horizon. Shale fragments occur in the lower parts of profiles where the soil formed in limestone interbedded with thin seams of shale.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam. Eroded pedons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5YR value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue o 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5  and chroma of 6 to 8.  It commonly has mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and olive, or they are profusely mottled with red, yellow, brown, and olive mottles. Some pedons are mottled with gray in the lower part. Texture is clay or silty clay except the upper few inches is silty clay loam in some pedons. They are firm or very firm when moist and plastic or very plastic when wet."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Collegedale soils are on uplands in valleys underlain by limestone.  These soils have 2 to 35 percent slopes. The soil formed in clayey residuum weathered from limestone which, in some places, is layered with shale.  Near the type location mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 53.6 inches."

Colbert, Carbo, Enders and Talbott soils are on similar adjacent positions and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Fullerton soils are on higher ridges and have more than 15 percent coarse fragments of chert in each horizon. Gladeville soils are on similar positions and are less than 12 inches to limestone rock."
