  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are typically calcareous at the surface but are leached up to 8 inches in some pedons.  Depth to bedrock exceeds 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F.  The soil is stratified with individual strata whose textures range from sandy loam to clay loam.  The particle size control, though stratified, averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Bulk texture is loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragments are variable within various strata but when averaged range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles within the control section.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 10 percent throughout with only minor segregation.  Gypsum crystals are common in some strata.  ESP ranges from 0 to 15 percent with the highest concentration located in thin strata at depths of 20 to 40 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  EC ranges from 0 to 14 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Strata of sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam are common and range from thin lenses to strata 10 inches thick.  EC ranges from 0 to 14 mmhos in the upper part and from 0 to 8 in the lower part.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clowers soils are on nearly level or gently sloping alluvial flood plains, drainageways, and terraces.  These soils formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 7,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and ranges from 5 to 9 inches.  About half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. and ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 90 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Debone, Edlin, Monte, and competing Quealman.  The Debone soils have a natric horizon and occur upslope on more stable surfaces.  Edlin soils have a developed B horizon, are coarse-loamy, and occur on more stable upslope positions.  Monte soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon and usually occupy the second terrace or toeslope positions.  Quealman soils occur intermixed with the Clowers soils."
