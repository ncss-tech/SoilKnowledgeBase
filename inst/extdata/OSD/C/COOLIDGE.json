Aco soils have fine sand below the particle-size control section.  Garywash soils have secondary accumulations of silica and gypsum in the control section. Laveen soils are loam and very fine sandy loam in the particle-size control section.  Rillito soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel.  Toltec soils have a calcic horizon that consists of a disintegrated hardpan."
