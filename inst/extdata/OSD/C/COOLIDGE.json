  "OVERVIEW": "The Coolidge series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan or stream alluvium.  Coolidge soils are on fan terraces, stream terraces or relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
