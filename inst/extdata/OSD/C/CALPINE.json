Cashmere soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part of the particle-size control section and do not have faint clay films lining pores and bridging sand grains.  Cashmont and Surpass soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Rio King soils have less than less than 60 percent sand and are not dominated by medium sand through very coarse sand in the particle-size control section and have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface.  Roloff and Roosevelt soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Snake Hollow soils are slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calpine soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 914 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm.  The mean January temperature is about -2.2 degrees C. in northeastern California and about 4 degrees C. in southern California.  The mean July temperature is about 20 degrees C. in northeastern California and about 20 degrees C. in southern California.  The mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 130 days."
