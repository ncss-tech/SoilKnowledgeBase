  "OVERVIEW": "The Calpine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Calpine soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 325 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
