    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches but should not be shallower than the upper 3 inches of the C horizon if the solum is thicker than 37 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  Thin discontinuous E horizons may occur in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is medium through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay loam, clay and silty clay loam with over 35 percent clay.  This horizon is medium acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, hue of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is typically clay or silty clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay.  This horizon is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

These soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, fine textured materials derived principally from sedimentary bedrocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F."
