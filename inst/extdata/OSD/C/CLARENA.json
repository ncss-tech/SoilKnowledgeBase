    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges in thickness from 12 to 20 inches.  The loess mantle is 1 to 5 inches thick.  The upper part of the control section ranges from 10 to 31 inches thick and is coarse-loamy.  The lower part of the control section is sandy or sandy-skeletal and averages from 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and neutral in the substratum.\nThe A part of the A/Bs horizon (absent in many pedons) has value moist of 2, 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs part of the A/Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/Bsb horizon has hue moist of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 2 or 3.\nThe 2Bs and 2Bs part of the 2E/Bsb horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 7.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.\nThe 3C horizons are variegated loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 75 percent and include 35 to 70 percent rounded gravel and 5 to 15 percent rounded cobble."
