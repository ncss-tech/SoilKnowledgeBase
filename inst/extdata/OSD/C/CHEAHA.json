Content of sandstone cobbles and stones larger than 3 inches ranges from 15 to 35 percent by volume in each horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is stony or cobbly fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.   Texture is stony or cobbly clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  Clay content of the Bt horizon increases with depth."

Fruithurst, Sherwood, State, and Wickham soils contain less than 15 percent cobbles or stones within their profiles and depth to hard bedrock is greater than 40 inches.  Clymer soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Hartsells soils have siliceous mineralogy and less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the A and Bt horizons."

Sandstone outcrops, escarpments, boulders, and colluvial rock flow are associated with Cheaha soils, and are a part of Cheaha landscape."
