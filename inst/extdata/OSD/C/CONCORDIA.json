Bankard, Glenberg, Nunn, Paoli, Satanta, and Sampson soils are well drained. Also, Bankard is sandy, adjacent to stream channels where sand has accumulated.  Glenberg and Paoli are coarse-loamy and adjacent to stream channels where sand has accumulated. Nunn does not have salt and occurs higher on the landscape. Satanta and Sampson are fine-loamy. Also, Satanta occurs on terraces. Las Animas is coarse-loamy and occurs in sandy low areas."
