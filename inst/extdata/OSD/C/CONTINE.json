  "OVERVIEW": "The Contine series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Contine soils are on fan terraces and basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",
