  "OVERVIEW": "The Cane series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils\nthat are permeable above a fragipan and slowly permeable in the fragipan.  These soils formed in colluvium, old alluvium, or\nvalley fill from interbedded sandstone, shale, or cherry limestone\nof the uplands.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

Some part of the solum contains more than 5 percent by\nvolume of chert fragments and/or quartzite pebbles.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6,\nand chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have A1 horizons, less\nthan 7 inches thick, with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through\n5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the A horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay\nloam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay,\nmore than 20 percent silt, and less than 45 percent sand coarser\nthan very fine sand.  Content of chert fragments and/or quartzite pebbles is 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 5 through 8 with common to many friable to very friable mottles in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and gray or it is\nmottled with these colors.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Content of chert fragments and/or quartzite pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nSome pedons have a B3 horizon within 60 inches of the surface and\na C horizon below a depth of about 60 inches.  Hue, value, chroma, and texture ranges are similar to the Bx horizon."
