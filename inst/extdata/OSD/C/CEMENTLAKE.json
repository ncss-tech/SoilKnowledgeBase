  "OVERVIEW": "The Cementlake series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable oils that formed in alluvial sediments derived from shale and sandstone onvalley sideslopes and terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature\nis 50 degrees F.",
