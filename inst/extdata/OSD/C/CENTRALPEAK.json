  "OVERVIEW": "The Centralpeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rock with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on ridges, shoulders, backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. .  There may be a component (less than 60 percent) of volcanic ash in the solum to a depth of 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 25 percent granitic rock fragments. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It contains 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Some pedons do not have an A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 0 to 25 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and dry.  It is loam, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It is 5 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon instead of, or in addition to, the 2Bw and 2C horizons. The 2C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand, and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 5 to 30 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some pedons do not have a 2C horizon."
