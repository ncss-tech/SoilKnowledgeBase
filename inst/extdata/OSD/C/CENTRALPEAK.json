  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. .  There may be a component (less than 60 percent) of volcanic ash in the solum to a depth of 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 25 percent granitic rock fragments. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It contains 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Some pedons do not have an A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 0 to 25 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and dry.  It is loam, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It is 5 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon instead of, or in addition to, the 2Bw and 2C horizons. The 2C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand, and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 5 to 30 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some pedons do not have a 2C horizon."

Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
