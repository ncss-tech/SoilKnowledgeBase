  "REVDATE": "09/2003",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Churubusco series are very poorly drained soils that formed in organic material overlying sandstone bedrock. Depth to bedrock is 16 to 50 inches. They are nearly level soils in depressions on bedrock controlled till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 34 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 16 to 50 inches. Woody fragments (up to 2 inches in diameter) are at random throughout the control section and comprise up to 10 percent of the volume in some pedons. Reaction in 0.01M CaC12 ranges from extremely acid to ultra acid throughout.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2 (or it is neutral). This tier consists of hemic and/or sapric material with primarily herbaceous fibers. It is massive or has weak granular structure.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. These tiers are dominantly sapric material with thin layers of hemic material in some pedons. The subsurface tier has weak granular structure or is massive. The bottom tier is commonly massive.\nSome pedons have a thin 2C horizon above the bedrock. It has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. The horizon is massive or has weak platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Skandia is the only other series in the same family. Skandia is not located in Region R.\nA closely related series is the Chippeny series, which is less acid.  Similar series include the Loxley, Bucksport, Lupton, Seelyeville, and Beseman soils. All of these do not have a lithic contact within the control section. Loxley, Bucksport, Lupton, and Seelyeville soils have organic matter extending to depths greater than 51 inches. Beseman soils have a mineral substratum."

The predominant underlying bedrock is sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F; and the mean frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet above sea level."

Wonsqueak and Bucksport soils formed in organic deposits where bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Ricker soils are well drained organic soils over bedrock. Irona, Conic, and Topknot soils are the commonly associated mineral soils."
