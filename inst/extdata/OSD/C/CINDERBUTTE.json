  "OVERVIEW": "The Cinderbutte series consists of moderately deep to cinders, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian sand overlying tephra.  Cinderbutte soils are on fissure vents and volcanic cones on lava fields. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature is 4 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm.",
