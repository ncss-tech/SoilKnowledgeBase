  "OVERVIEW": "The Cymric series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvial material from sedimentary rock sources.  Cymric soils are on high stream terraces and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 8 to 20 inches.  The soils receive intermittent moisture from mid-November to mid-April; about 6 out of 10 years, they are never moist in some part between a depth of 8 inches and the duripan for 90 consecutive days.  Rock fragments range in size from 2mm to 10mm and range from 10 to 15 percent by volume.  Organic carbon content in the upper 16 inches ranges from 1 to 1.5 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe C1sicam horizon, or the silica-lime cemented duripan is as thin as 0.5 to 4mm consisting of a very distinct, hard opalized band with dry color of 10YR 7/3, 8/1, 8/2, 8/3.  Cementation of the duripan is not destroyed by soaking in concentrated HCL for 24 hours.\nThe C2ca horizon is a weakly cemented sandy loam or loamy sand, with similar colors.  Gravel content ranges from 10 to 15 percent."
