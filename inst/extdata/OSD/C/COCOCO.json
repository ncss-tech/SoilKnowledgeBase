  "OVERVIEW": "The Cococo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in broadly stratified alluvium derived predominantly from dolomite. Cococo soils are on washes and stream terraces between structural benches. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
