  "OVERVIEW": "The Caneycreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in old alluvium derived largely from acid sandstone, siltstone and shale from overlying Pennsylvanian-aged bedrock. KSAT is moderately low. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1088 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11.5 degrees C. (53 degrees F).",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Caneycreek soils were previously mapped as Tyler in the 1965 soil survey of Elliott County. These areas were found to be coarse-loamy, not fine-silty. The series was proposed in Elliott County, Kentucky, 2005.\nThis series has a deep analogue that may be developed into a new series if enough acres are identified in other parts of the MLRA.\nThe 01/2008 revision changes the status from tentative to established. Additionally, other minor edits were completed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches; Oi, A and E horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - 28 to 142 centimeters (11 to 56 inches; Bt, Btgx1 and Btgx2 horizons)\n3. Fragipan - 51 to 142 centimeters (20 to 56 inches; Btgx1 and Btgx2 horizons)\n4. Lithologic discontinuity - 153 centimeters (60 inches)\nTextures of this pedon description were based on laboratory PSD analysis. Other field measured properties include:\nHorizon      pH (Hellige-Truog)   Field Texture\nA            6.5                  fsl\nE            6.5                  fsl\nBt           5.5                  l\nBtgx1        5.0                  l\nBtgx2        5.5                  l\nCg           5.0                  sil\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data are available on the typifying pedon, S05KY-063-01 and one more sample also taken from Elliott County (S05KY-063-04).\nMLRA: 124\nRevised: 2/2007-AKM, DHK; 1/2008-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
