    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Caneycreek soils are found on high stream terraces along major rivers and steams, commonly separated from a constructional valley floor by steep hillslopes. Caneycreek soils formed in old alluvium derived largely from acid sandstone siltstone and shale. Thickness of the alluvium ranges from 60 inches to 80 inches or more. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1088 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11.5 degrees C. (53 degrees F)."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Caneycreek soils were previously mapped as Tyler in the 1965 soil survey of Elliott County. These areas were found to be coarse-loamy, not fine-silty. The series was proposed in Elliott County, Kentucky, 2005.\nThis series has a deep analogue that may be developed into a new series if enough acres are identified in other parts of the MLRA.\nThe 01/2008 revision changes the status from tentative to established. Additionally, other minor edits were completed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches; Oi, A and E horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - 28 to 142 centimeters (11 to 56 inches; Bt, Btgx1 and Btgx2 horizons)\n3. Fragipan - 51 to 142 centimeters (20 to 56 inches; Btgx1 and Btgx2 horizons)\n4. Lithologic discontinuity - 153 centimeters (60 inches)\nTextures of this pedon description were based on laboratory PSD analysis. Other field measured properties include:\nHorizon      pH (Hellige-Truog)   Field Texture\nA            6.5                  fsl\nE            6.5                  fsl\nBt           5.5                  l\nBtgx1        5.0                  l\nBtgx2        5.5                  l\nCg           5.0                  sil\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data are available on the typifying pedon, S05KY-063-01 and one more sample also taken from Elliott County (S05KY-063-04).\nMLRA: 124\nRevised: 2/2007-AKM, DHK; 1/2008-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
