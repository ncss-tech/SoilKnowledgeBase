Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 5,400 feet.  In some areas as much as 50 percent of the surface is covered by cobbles or stones.  Rock outcrops are common.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
