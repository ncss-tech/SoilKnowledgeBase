  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavendish series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Cavendish soils are on hills, ridges, escarpments and benches on basalt plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  The average annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
