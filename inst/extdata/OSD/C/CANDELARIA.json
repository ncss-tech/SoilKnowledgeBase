  "OVERVIEW": "The Candelaria series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Candelaria soils are on ballenas and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
