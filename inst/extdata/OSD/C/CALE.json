  "OVERVIEW": "The Cale series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from limestone.  Cale soils are on dissected alluvial uplands and valleys and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils formed in alluvium and eolian material derived primarily from limestone or shale.  The valleys are normally entrenched.  Annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The average annual  temperature is about 51 to 58 degrees F. The frost free period is 130 to 170 days.  In Colorado major precipitation falls from May through August and is as much as 16 inches and has elevations as low as 5300 feet."
