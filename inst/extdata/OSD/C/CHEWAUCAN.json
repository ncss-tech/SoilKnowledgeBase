  "OVERVIEW": "The Chewaucan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Chewaucan soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, tuff, and andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
