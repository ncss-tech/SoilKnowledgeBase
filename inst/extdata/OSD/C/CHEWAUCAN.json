  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chewaucan soils are on lake terraces or structural benches below the high-water mark of Pleistocene lakes.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, tuff, and andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."

Booth soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have 45 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have a frigid temperature regime.  McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal and are on lower lake terraces.  Redcanyon soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and are on adjacent hills."
