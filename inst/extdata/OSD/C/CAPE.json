  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Salzer series in the same family. Other series in closely related families are Chequest, Jacob, Piopolis and Zipp soils. Salzer soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F (8 to 11 degrees C). Chequest and Zipp soils are non-acid and in addition, Chequest soils have a mollic epipedon. Jacob soils contain more clay in the upper part of the solum. Piopolis soils contain less clay in the series control section."

The Cape soils formed in slack-water silt and clay sediments. Summers are hot and winters are cold. The mean annual air temperature is 53 to 59 degrees F (11 to 15 degrees C) and mean annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches (889 to 1143 mm)."

This data mapunit represents the OSD pedon for Cape.\nThe Cape soils were previously classified as:\n1. Vertic Fluvaquents, fine, montmorillonitic, acid, mesic (classification adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 23 Aug 94 by CLG)\n2. Typic Fluvaquents, fine, montmorillonitic, acid, mesic, 1967.\n3. Alluvial soils intergrading toward Low Humic Gley soil in the 1938 classification by great group system.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
