  "OVERVIEW": "The Cape series consists of deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey slack water sediments on low lying flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches (1118 mm) and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",

Vertic Fluvaquents, fine, montmorillonitic, acid, mesic (classification adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 23 Aug 94 by CLG)\n2. Typic Fluvaquents, fine, montmorillonitic, acid, mesic, 1967.\n3. Alluvial soils intergrading toward Low Humic Gley soil in the 1938 classification by great group system."
