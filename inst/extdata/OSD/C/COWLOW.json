  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowlow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from red sandstone or red siltstone, yellow sandstone or siltstone or gray siltstone.  Cowlow soils are on mountain backslopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
