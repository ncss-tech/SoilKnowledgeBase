  "OVERVIEW": "The Cleverly series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  The Cleverly soils are on gently sloping to very steep alluvial fans and colluvial slopes.  Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

The average summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.\nThe solum is 30 to 45 inches thick.  The soil is gravelly throughout, and may overlie strongly calcareous lake sediments at depths of 30 inches or more.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand and more than 15 percent fine and very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 and 3.  It is gravelly sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay and may contain some cobble and stone. This horizon has weak to moderate medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe weak Ck horizon, if present, is thin lime coating on underside of coarse fragments.  The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3."

Juliaetta, Phoebe, Sheridan, and Uhlig soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the series control section.  Kilburn soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Knutsen soils have more than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand and less than 15 percent fine and very fine sand in the soil fraction of the control section.  Laidlaw soils contain a high content of pumice.  Pleasant View soils have calcic horizons and have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Ridd soils have argillic horizons."

Slope gradients are 3 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured alluvium, dominantly from finely fractured quartzite rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 59 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost free season is 150 to 190 days, although shorter seasons would not be excluded."
