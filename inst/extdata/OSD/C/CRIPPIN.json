  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness typically is 30 to 36 inches but ranges from 20 to 48 inches. The solum is typically slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon and moderately alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizons. However, the range includes those soils that are neutral to a depth of about 10 inches. The upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control section has less than 30 percent clay. The calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10 to 40 inch control section is about 5 to 20 percent. The weighted average of the 10 to 40 inch control section is 23 to 29 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon is typically black (N 2/0) or (10YR 2/1) but ranges to very dark gray (10YR 3/1). The AB horizon ranges from black (10YR 2/1) to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2). The A horizon typically is loam but ranges to clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon typically is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or (2.5Y 4/2), but the BA horizon ranges from black (10YR 2/1) to very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2). Some pedons that have mottles in the upper part of the Bw horizon have chroma of 3 and hue of 10YR or 2.5Y in the same subhorizons. In some pedons the lower part of the Bw horizon and the BC horizon range to include value of 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Typically all but the upper part of the B horizon has few to common and faint to prominent mottles. In many pedons there are a few strong brown to reddish brown or black concretions which are assumed to be iron and manganese oxides. The Bw horizon is typically loam, but in some pedons it is clay loam. In some pedons there is a Bk horizon with secondary calcium carbonate accumulations underlying the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon typically has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, but some pedons have 5Y hue, value is 4 or 5, and chroma is 2 to 4. Faint to prominent mottles of fine strong brown to reddish brown or black oxide concretions, and accumulations of segregated carbonates are common. It is loam or clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arkton, Floyd, Fostoria, Kensett, Merton, Nicollet, Ottosen, Readlyn, Snider, Stabbart and Wilmonton series. None of these soils are calcareous in all parts of the control section. In addition, Arkton soils have more than 30 percent clay in the upper part of the particle size control section and have a weighted average of 28 to 43 percent clay in the control section. Kensett soils have a lithic contact with limestone at depths of 24 and 40 inches. Readlyn soils have a stone line and have firm consistence in the lower part of the B horizon. Snider soils contain less than 23 percent clay in the upper part of the control section. Stabbart soils are drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following summer solstice. Wilmonton soils have firm consistence in the lower part of the control section."

Crippin soils formed in friable, calcareous, loam or clay loam till thought to be of late Wisconsin Age. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches."

Clarion soils are on slopes with gradients over 3 percent and are better drained. Canisteo and Webster soils are on broad, poorly drained level areas. Harps soils are slightly lower in elevation and surround soils in the very poorly drained depressions. They are higher in calcium carbonate content. Nicollet soils are on the same slopes, often adjacent to Crippin soils, but generally somewhat higher in elevation. Okoboji soils are in very poorly drained depressions."
