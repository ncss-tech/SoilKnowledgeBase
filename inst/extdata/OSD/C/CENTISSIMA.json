The difference between mean annual winter and mean annual summer temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts about 270 to 300 days.  Reaction is slightly acid to medium acid.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout and decreases as depth increases.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown or brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2). Moist color is very dark grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2). This horizon is gravelly loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon is light yellowish brown, brownish yellow, or pale brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6). Most color is dark brown, dark yellowish brown or yellowish brown (10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 5/6). This horizon is loam or gravelly loam.  There is a 1 to less than 3 percent increase in clay content from the A horizon to the B horizon.\nThe C horizon is light brown, reddish yellow, light yellowish brown, or brownish yellow (7.5YR 6/4, 6/6; 10YR 6/4, 6/6). Moist color is brown, strong brown, yellowish brown or yellowish red (7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 4/6). The upper part of the C horizon is loam or gravelly clay loam.  The upper part ranges from 5 to 35 percent gravel and the lower part from 35 to 50 percent gravel."
