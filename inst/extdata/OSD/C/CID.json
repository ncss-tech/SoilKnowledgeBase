Content of coarse fragments, mainly channers, is 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the BA, BE, and Bt horizons, and 5 to 35 percent in the BC and BCg horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is mottled in these colors. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow may be present. Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the upper boundary of this horizon. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximrphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow and redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray, brown, and yellow are in most pedons. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, yellow, and brown are present. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BCtg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, yellow, and brown are present. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow and redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray, brown, and yellow are in some pedons.

Annemaine, Craven, Dogue, Eulonia, Gritney, Nemours, Nevarc, and Wolftever soils formed in marine sediments or alluvium and lack bedrock within a depth of 80 inches. Creedmoor soils have higher exchangeable aluminum and does not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Helena soils are very deep. Lignum soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Mandale (T) soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches.  Newco and Stapp soils have red colors in the Bt horizon. Rosenwall, Sacul, and Vinita soils are underlain by shale or sandstone and contain fragments of those rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cid soils are on undulating to gently sloping interstream divides, on lower side slopes, or on broad flats around the heads of drainageways on the uplands. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from argillite and other fine-grained metavolcanic rocks. Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. near the type location."

Alamance, Badin, Georgeville, Goldston, Herndon, Nanford, Nason, Tarrus, and Tatum soils are well drained. Alamance, Callison, Kirksey, Montonia, and Secrest soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.

Goldston and Misenheimer soils have loamy horizons less than 20 inches deep over a paralithic contact. Oakboro soils have less clay and are on flood plains."
