  "OVERVIEW": "The Cid series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils on Piedmont uplands. These soils formed in residuum weathered from argillite and other fine-grained metavolcanic rocks. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F. near the type location.",

Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow may be present. Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the upper boundary of this horizon. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximrphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow and redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray, brown, and yellow are in most pedons.

Annemaine, Craven, Dogue, Eulonia, Gritney, Nemours, Nevarc, and Wolftever soils formed in marine sediments or alluvium and lack bedrock within a depth of 80 inches. Creedmoor soils have higher exchangeable aluminum and does not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Helena soils are very deep. Lignum soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Mandale (T) soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches.  Newco and Stapp soils have red colors in the Bt horizon. Rosenwall, Sacul, and Vinita soils are underlain by shale or sandstone and contain fragments of those rocks."
