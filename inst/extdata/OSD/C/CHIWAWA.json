    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples, and 15 to 35 percent pumice.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It has weak granular or platy structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or paragravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has weak subangular blocky or granular structure.   Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or paragravelly ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon is very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly sand or extremely cobbly sand.  The 2C horizon contains 0 to 5 percent pumice."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Polander,  Rathdrum, and  Thow series.  Polander soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and lack pumice fragments.  Rathdrum soils are silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam throughout the particle-size control section and are dry less than 60 consecutive days.  Thow soils are on mountains and lack the underlying glacial outwash material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chiwawa soils are on terraces at elevations of 1,700 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash, pumice, and a small amount of loess overlying glacial outwash.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days."
