  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiwawa series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice overlying glacial outwash.  Chiwawa soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples, and 15 to 35 percent pumice.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It has weak granular or platy structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or paragravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has weak subangular blocky or granular structure.   Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or paragravelly ashy sandy loam.
