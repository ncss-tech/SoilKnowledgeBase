  "OVERVIEW": "The Centeral Point series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Central Point soils are on low stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; the mean January temperature is 37 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 18 to 45 inches.  In the interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 90 inches.
