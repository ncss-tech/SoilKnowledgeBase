Edmundston soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.  Imbler soils have sandy loam sola with less than 30 percent medium and coarser sands, have soft and very friable sola, have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F and lack a cambic horizon.  Oak Glen soils have an aridic soil moisture regime and lack a cambic horizon.  Uhlig soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F, are silt loam or loam in the solum and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Central Point soils are on low stream terraces and alluvial fans and are at elevations of 200 to 2,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium mainly from granitic and metamorphic origin.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; the mean January temperature is 37 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 18 to 45 inches.  In the interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 90 inches.  The frost-free period is 140 to 210 days."
