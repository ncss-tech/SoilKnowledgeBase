These soils formed in eolian and marine sand derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters (35 to 80 inches). The mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."
