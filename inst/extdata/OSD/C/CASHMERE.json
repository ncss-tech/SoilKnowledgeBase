Burch soils are loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam throughout the particle-size control section. Calpine soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout the particle-size control section and have faint clay films line pores and bridge between grains. Cashmont soils are 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Roloff and Roosevelt soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Snake Hollow soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the lower part of the control section. Rio King soils are moderately well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in glaciofluvial material and alluvium mixed with loess in the surface.  Elevations are 700 to 3,000 feet. They occur in a cool, dry semiarid climate; mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, mean January temperature is 22 degrees F., mean July temperature is 73 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F., and frost-free period is 140 to 195 days."
