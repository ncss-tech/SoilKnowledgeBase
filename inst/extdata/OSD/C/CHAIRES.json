    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 50 to 80 inches or more. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the A, E, Bh, and Bw horizons and from very strongly acid to neutral in the Btg horizon. Total thickness of the A and E horizons is less than 30 inches, and combined thickness of the A, E, and Bh horizon is 30 inches or more.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less. Where value is less than 3.5, thickness is less than 10 inches. Texture is sand, fine sand, mucky sand, or mucky fine sand.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is less than 8 inches in thickness. It has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less. Texture is muck.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8. Some pedons have masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow and/or vertical streaks in shades of black or gray in this horizon. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh and Bh' horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Consistence ranges from very friable to weakly cemented and brittle. Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow and gray range from few to many. Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bh' horizon, where present, has the same range of colors and textures as the Bh horizon.\nThe E' horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray range from few to common. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam and ranges to sandy clay in the lower horizons.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of soft weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade. It has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance and low to high excavation difficulty and typically contains soft carbonate accumulations that contain few to may hard fragments of limestone or chert. It is highly irregular and complex and interspersed with solution holes that are filled with material that ranges in texture from sandy loam to sandy clay. The holes range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter. The depth to limestone varies widely within short distances. Thickness ranges from 6 inches to 2 feet.\nThe R layer, where present, is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance and very high to extremely high excavation difficulty. In some pedons, solution holes are present."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments in the Lower Coastal Plain. The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Leon   and the poorly drained Talquin soils are on similar positions but do not have argillic horizons. The somewhat poorly drained Lutterloh soils are on slightly higher positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick and lack spodic horizons. The somewhat poorly drained Moriah soils are on slightly higher positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick, do not have spodic horizons and are deep to limestone bedrock. Tooles soils are on similar positions, do not have spodic horizons, and are deep to limestone bedrock.\nTalquin soils are on similar positions and lack argillic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Chaires soils were formerly included in the Leon series. The 7/93 revision changed the series classification to recognize the 1992 amendments to Soil Taxonomy that introduces changes in classification of Spodosols.\nThe water table is within depths of 18 inches in the flatwoods for 1 to 3 months during periods of high rainfall and within depths of 20 to 40 inches for 6 months or more during most years. Depressional areas are ponded for 6 to 9 months in most years.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone from the surface to a depth of 28 inches (Ap, A2 and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 17 to 28 inches (E horizon).\nSpodic horizons - the zone from 28 to 47 inches and from 52 to 54 inches (Bh1, Bh2, Bh3 and Bh' horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 54 to 80 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\nChaires soils are in MLRAs 133A and 152A.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http;://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data was provided by the Soil Characterization Lab, IFAS, Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL., and the National Soil Survey laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
