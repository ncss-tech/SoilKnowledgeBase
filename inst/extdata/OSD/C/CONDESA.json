  "OVERVIEW": "The Condesa series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from sandstone.  Condesa soils are lower areas on summits of plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
