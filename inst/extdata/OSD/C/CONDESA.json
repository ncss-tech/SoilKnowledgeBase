    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Condesa soils are on lower areas on summits of mesas and plateaus. They formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from Triassic and Permian age sandstone. Slopes are 2 to 6 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 8,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
