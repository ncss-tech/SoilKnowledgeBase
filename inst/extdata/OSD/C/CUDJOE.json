It is calcareous, effervescent, and has more than 90 percent calcium carbonate.  Content of limestone fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is less than 3 inches in thickness and has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is composed of sapric material.  Texture is muck.\nThe Lk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is marl with a non-carbonate free texture of silt or silt loam.\nThe R horizon is soft to hard, rippable coral or oolitic limestone."

Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in calcareous marl that is shallow over coral or oolitic limestone.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 78 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches."

The very poorly drained Islamorada, Keylargo, and Tavernier soils are on lower positions and are organic.  In addition, Islamorada soils are very deep to limestone and Keylargo soils are moderately deep to limestone.  The well drained Keyvaca and Pennekamp soils are on higher positions, have loamy-skeletal mineral control sections, and are Mollisols.  In addition, Pennekamp soils have muck surface layers.  Keywest and Lignumvitae soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Keywest soils have a buried histic epipedon and are deep to limestone while Lignumvitae soils are moderately deep to limestone.  The moderately well drained Matecumbe soils are on higher landforms and have muck surface layers."
