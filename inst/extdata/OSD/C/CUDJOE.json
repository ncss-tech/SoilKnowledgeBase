  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cudjoe series consists of shallow, poorly drained, moderately to moderately rapid permeable soils in tidal and other flooded areas of the Florida Keys.  They formed in calcareous marl over rippable coral or oolitic limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 76 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 3 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  It is calcareous, effervescent, and has more than 90 percent calcium carbonate.  Content of limestone fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is less than 3 inches in thickness and has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is composed of sapric material.  Texture is muck.\nThe Lk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is marl with a non-carbonate free texture of silt or silt loam.\nThe R horizon is soft to hard, rippable coral or oolitic limestone."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cudjoe soils are on tidal mangrove swamps and other areas subject to frequent flooding.  Elevations range from 0 to 3 feet above 1929 NGVD.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in calcareous marl that is shallow over coral or oolitic limestone.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 78 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches."

The very poorly drained Islamorada, Keylargo, and Tavernier soils are on lower positions and are organic.  In addition, Islamorada soils are very deep to limestone and Keylargo soils are moderately deep to limestone.  The well drained Keyvaca and Pennekamp soils are on higher positions, have loamy-skeletal mineral control sections, and are Mollisols.  In addition, Pennekamp soils have muck surface layers.  Keywest and Lignumvitae soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Keywest soils have a buried histic epipedon and are deep to limestone while Lignumvitae soils are moderately deep to limestone.  The moderately well drained Matecumbe soils are on higher landforms and have muck surface layers."
