  "OVERVIEW": "The Coltroop series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in a loess mantle over alluvium derived from rhyolite and basalt. The Coltroop soils are on plateaus and rock pediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
