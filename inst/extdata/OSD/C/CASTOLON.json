These soils formed in stratified, fine-silty alluvium. Mean annual precipitation is 254 to 330 mm (10 to 13 inches). Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June to September. Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. Frost free period range from 240 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 1,710 to 4,000 feet."
