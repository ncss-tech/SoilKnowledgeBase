Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Moncha, Oshoto, Wetherill, and Wiley soils are very deep. Amal, Elpedro and Sharps soils receive higher amounts of winter precipitation. In addition, Amal soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches and Elpedro soils are weathered from limestone and are dominated by silt loam and silty clay loam textures. Buick, Keiser, Klinedraw, Oshoto, and Wiley soils are more moist in the late spring and early summer (May and June) and dry in late summer in the soil moisture control section. Pulpit, Roubideau, and Verde soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Wetherill soils receive higher amounts of winter precipitation and have calcic horizons below 40 inches. Moncha soils have silt loam and silty clay loam textures and do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates. Chita soils have calcic horizons within 40 inches and should be reclassified in the Calcidic subgroup."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Chevelon soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Elevation is 4,600 to 6,500 feet. They are formed in slope alluvium over interbedded shale, siltstone and soft calcareous sandstone. The climate is continental. Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 59 degrees F., and the frost-free period is ranges from 120 to 170 days."
