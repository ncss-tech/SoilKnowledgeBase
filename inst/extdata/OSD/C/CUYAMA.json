  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 46 inches, but averages 39 inches. The soil between a depth of 10 to 36 inches is usually moist in some part of the moisture control section from December 15 until April 30 and dry th remainder of the year. These soils have an Aridic moisture regime bordering on Xeric. Mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 4/3 or 4/4. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Clay percentage ranges from 5 to 20. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Organic carbon is less than 0.5 percent and decreases regularly with depth. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B2tca horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/6; 7.5YR 5/6 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/6, 3/6; 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6 or 4/6. It is sandy clay loam, heavy loam or clay loam. Clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. It is strongly or violently effervescent in the lower part. In many places segregated lime is present in some part of the horizon. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline. SAR is 2 to 10.\nThe C horizon has dry color or 10YR 7/6, 6/6 or 6/4; 7.5YR 5/6 and moist color of 5/6, 4/6, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6. It is sandy clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand with 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent gravel. Some pedons are stratified. Lime is usually present throughout the horizon. SAR is 10 to 25."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation is 425 to 1,000 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and mild somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches. Mean January temperature is 42 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 80 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 64 to 67 degrees F. Frost-free season is 275 to 325 days."
