Solum thickness ranges from 40 or more than 60 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains a weighted average of 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments including some pumiceous fragments. Hues are 2.5Y to 7.5YR.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist and 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the Bw horizon, except hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  It is silt loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral to strongly acid.  Till substratum phases are recognized."

Similar soils in other families are the Bear Prairie, Calawah, Hemcross, Le Bar, Lytell, Mossyrock, Trouter, Newaukum, Quillayute, Trouter, and Winema series.  All of these soils except Mossyrock, Newaukum, and Trouter have a udic moisture regime.  Mossyrock soils have an umbric epipedon 24 to 34 inches thick.  Newaukum soils contain l5 to 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the particle-size control section. Trouter soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact."
