  "OVERVIEW": "The Crefork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated mudstone and other fine-grained bedded sediments.  These soils are on hill sideslopes.  Slope is 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
