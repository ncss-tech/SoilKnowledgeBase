  "OVERVIEW": "The Coghill series consists of very deep, well drained, moderateand moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum from quartzose limestone, and interbedded calcareous sandstone and shale.  These soils are on gently sloping to very steep uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are channers and gravels of decalcified calcareous sandstone, quartzose limestone, and shale and range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons, and up to 35 percent in th BC and C horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Where both value and chroma are 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles, where present, are in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some Bt horizons formed in shale layers and have a noticeable decrease of sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Mottles and clay films are in shades or red, yellow, or brown.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  A lithologic discontinuity occurs below the control section in pedons where the soil weathered through interbedded materials.  The 2BC or 2C horizons, where present, have the same colors and textures as the C horizon, but have platy relict rock structure and/or variegated colors indicative of the parent materials."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are currently the Albertville, Badin, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Corryton, Luverne, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Peakin,  Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, Uwharrie, and Vance series.  Soils in related families include the Fluvanna, Mattaponi, Noah, and Williamsville series.  Albertville, Carnasaw, Fluvanna, and Noah soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Badin and Townley soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 24 to 50 inches of alluvium over residuum.  Corryton soils formed entirely in shale or siltstone, and have a higher content of silt, and less sand throughout.  Luverne soils contain mica flakes.  Masada soils contain mica flakes, coarse fragments of quartz, quartzite, gneiss or schist.  Mattaponi soils formed in Coastal Plain sediments.  Mayodan and Peakin soils formed in residuum from Triassic materials in the Southern Piedmont.  McQueen soils formed in fluvial sediments and are on stream terraces.  Nason soils have 25 to 50 inch sola and contain quartz and schist fragments.  Sweatman soils contain mica flakes.  Tatum soils contain schist fragments and have a paralithic contact with weathered schist.  Uwharrie soils formed in residuum from slate, phyllite, or sericite schist in the Southern Piedmont.  Vance soils have C horizons of saprolite weathered from felsic crystalline rock.  More competitors will become apparent as more series are reclassified."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coghill soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland ridges and side slopes.  These soils are commonly adjacent to areas of soils that have rhodic colors.  They formed in residuum from Ordovician-aged limestones, shales, and sandstones.  Common geologic formations include the Holston limestone, Chapman Ridge sandstone, and Ottosee shale. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 56.5 inches."

Alcoa soils are in a Rhodic subgroup and Tellico soils are in a Rhodic great group.  Additionally, Alcoa soils are on foot slopes and stream terraces.  Corryton soils are on similar landscape positions, but formed entirely in shale residuum, and have less sand throughout the subsoil.  Neubert soils are on adjacent narrow floodplains.  Steekee soils are on nearby side slopes and ridge tops and are in a shallow family.  Tellico soils are on adjacent gently sloping to very steep ridge tops and side slopes.  Red Hills soils are on adjacent side slopes, do not have an argillic horizon, and are moderately deep."
