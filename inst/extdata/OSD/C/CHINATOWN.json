  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinatown series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone.  These soils occur on hills.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
