  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavemountain series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. The Cavemountain soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
