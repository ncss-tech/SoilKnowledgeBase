  "OVERVIEW": "The Cass series consists of deep, well drained soils. They formed in alluvium on floodplains in Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 71, Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters (26 inches) at the type location.",
