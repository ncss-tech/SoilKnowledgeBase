Gravel content ranges from 20 to 65 percent, cobble content ranges from 5 to 40 percent, and stones range from 0 to 20 percent. The control section averages between 35 and 90 percent rock fragments by volume. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an A horizon. The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. The A and E horizons are loamy sand, sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam or very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bhs horizon is sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam or very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The Bs horizon is coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 to 6.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Copper Harbor soils are on glacial lake benches, stream terraces and outwash plains. The upper deposits were formed in cobbly, gravelly and sandy glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits.  The substratum was formed in cobbly and gravelly till.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

Bete Grise soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in slightly depressional areas and drainageways. Waiska soils are excessively drained and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Nipissing soils are moderately deep, well drained soils on bedrock benches.  The somewhat poorly drained Gratiot soils are in depressions and drainageways and formed in gravelly and cobbly sandy loam glacial till."
