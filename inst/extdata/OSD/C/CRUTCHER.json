  "OVERVIEW": "The Crutcher series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium over lacustrine deposits.  Crutcher soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
