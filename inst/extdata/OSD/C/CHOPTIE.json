  "OVERVIEW": "The Choptie series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered mainly from tuff. They are on low hills and ridges and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 inches and the lithic contact for about 80 to 90 consecutive days in summer and are moist in winter. Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. Hard lava rock fragments are 0 to 30 percent.  Weathered cinders or other soft rock fragments make up 0 to 20 percent of the whole soil volume.  It is neutral or slightly acid throughout.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and has 12 to 18 percent clay.  Underlying bedrock is typically extremely hard pumice tuff, tuffaceous breccia and tuffaceous sandstone but includes basalt and andesite."

The mean January temperature is about 26 to 27 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 61 to 63 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 43 to 45 degrees F.
