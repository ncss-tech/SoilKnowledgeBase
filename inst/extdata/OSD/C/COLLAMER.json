  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 61 to 132 cm. Bedrock is deeper than 152 cm. Depth to carbonates ranges from 51 to 183 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout, however in some pedons that are underlain with till rock fragment content ranges up to 35 percent by volume below a depth of 102 cm. Some surfaces may have up to 10 percent rock fragment content. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in surface layer and upper part of the subsoil, moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the subsoil, and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nIn some pedons, an E horizon is present. It has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It normally has common or many high chroma redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. It is massive, or has weak platy or subangular blocky structure. Consistence ranges from very friable to firm.\nThe E/B and B/E horizons have E horizon-like material on exteriors of peds and are like the Bt horizon in interior of peds. The B/E horizon has few to many redoximorphic concentrations with chroma of 3 or more.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 6, above 76 cm and chroma of 2 to 6 below 76 cm. It has few to many, low chroma redoximorphic depletions and high chroma redoximorphic concentrations. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam, except individual thin subhorizons range from fine sandy loam to silty clay. It has weak to moderate subangular blocky, angular blocky, or prismatic structure.\nA BC horizon is present in some pedons. It has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y. It has weak or moderate platy or prismatic structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam to stratified silt and very fine sand.\nSome pedons, below a depth of 102 cm, have a 2C horizon with textures of gravelly loam to channery silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Collamer soils are nearly level to moderately steep with slope ranging from 0 to 25 percent. These soils developed in calcareous lake laid silt and very fine sand deposits. They are on glacial lake plains and on till plains that have a moderately thick mantle of glacio-lacustrine sediments. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 66 to 102 cm, and annual frost-free season ranges from 130 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 29 to 518 m above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Collamer soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Dunkirk, the somewhat poorly drained Niagara, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Canandaigua soils. Other associated soils are the Alton, Amboy, Arkport, Colonie, Howard, Hudson, Palmyra, Schoharie, and Sodus soils. Alton, Howard, and Palmyra soils are on adjacent gravelly terraces. Amboy soils have a fragipan. Arkport and Colonie soils are in nearby deltaic deposits that have a higher sand content. Sodus soils are on adjacent glacial till plains."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 46 to 84 cm (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n3. Glossic properties- the zone from 46 to 58 cm (Bt/E horizon).\n4. Udic soil moisture regime.\n5. CEC activity class of semi-active from preponderance of lab data for the Dunkirk-Collamer-Niagara catena.\n(6) This pedon sampled as S07NY069048 and run through NSSC lab (now KSSL).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
