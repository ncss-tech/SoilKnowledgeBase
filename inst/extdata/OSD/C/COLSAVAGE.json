  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually calcareous to the surface but are leached in some pedons.  The control section contains more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature is 59 to 69 degrees F.\nThe A horizon ranges in hue from 5Y through 10YR, value from 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  When the value of the A horizon is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist, the horizon is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Texture is a clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has the same range as the A horizon.  It is a structured Bw horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay or clay loam with clay ranging from 35 to 55 percent.  Lime is disseminated or as few soft masses and contains about 2 to 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Salinity is 2 to 4 mmhos."

Dollard soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section and have a uniform precipitation with June as the driest month.  Gunsone, Nobe, Rhoamett, Sunburst, and Vanda soils lack a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  In addition, Gunsone soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder, Nobe soils have an EC of from 15 to 25 mmhos, and Vanda soils have an ESP of 20 to 30 percent."
