  "OVERVIEW": "The Coffee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from loess underlain by basalt.  They are on basalt plains.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
