  "OVERVIEW": "The Crowley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits of the Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on flat coastal plains terraces. Slope is dominantly less than 1 percent but ranges to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees c (68 degrees F).",
