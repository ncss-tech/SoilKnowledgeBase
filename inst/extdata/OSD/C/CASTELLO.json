Depth to continuous horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation is 6 to 12 inches. Gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent throughout. The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 8 and 18 percent noncarbonate clay. The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam. The Cca horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. Texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 70 percent."
