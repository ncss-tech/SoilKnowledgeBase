Soils that do not have surface modification are included in this concept.\nThe lithologic discontinuity separating the anthropogenic material and natural soil is not series criteria.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 2014CA6961065.\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
