  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Centinela series consists of well drained soils that formed in a thin surface mantle of human-transport materials (HTM) overlying alluvium from marine or mixed rock sources. Centinela soils are on alluvial fans remnant, inset fans, fluviomarine bottoms and low lying terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 342 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C.",
