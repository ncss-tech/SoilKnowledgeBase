  "OVERVIEW": "The Corbett series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Corbett soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 35 inches which occurs mostly as snow.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F."
