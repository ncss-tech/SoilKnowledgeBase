  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Corbett soils are on mountains.  They mostly occur on north and east-facing footslopes and backslopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks such as granodiorite or granite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Rock outcrop is common.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 35 inches which occurs mostly as snow.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F."
