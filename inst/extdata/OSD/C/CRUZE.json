  "REVDATE": "12/1999",
  "STATES": "KY,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cruze series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from acid shale with some thin layers of sandstone or siltstone.  These soils are on uplands and have moderately slow or slow permeability.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Rock fragments, mostly flat fragments of sandstone and siltstone less than 6 inches in length, vary considerably and range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the A horizon and 0 to 35 percent in individual horizon of the Bt and BC horizons (and C horizons, where present).\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is medium acid to extremely acid.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon and an E horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6, and mottles are of high and low chroma, (low chroma is within the upper 24 inches).  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery or shaly analogues.  The Bt horizon is strongly acid to extremely acid throughout.\nThe BC horizon (and C horizon where present) has similar color, texture, and reaction range as the lower part of the Bt horizon."

Keyport and Zoar soils formed in coastal plain sediments or slackwater sediments and essentially do not have coarse fragments or have few coarse fragments in the solum.  Latham soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Brookside and Guernsey soils have higher base saturation.  Wharton soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slope gradients range from 2 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from acid shale and some thin layers of interbedded siltstone or sandstone.  In some pedons materials are mixed from downslope movement.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 54 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 42 inches."

The moderately well drained Latham and Rarden soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on summits or on shoulder or back slope positions.  In addition, the Rarden soils are redder and have higher base saturation.  The moderately well drained Coolville soils have a mantle of loess and are on the broadest and most stable summits and benches.  The well drained Lily soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on nearby summits.  The well drained Muse and Shelocta soils are on steeper parts of side slopes, foot slopes, or benches."
