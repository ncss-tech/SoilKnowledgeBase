  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheadle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived mainly from hard sandstone, but may be underlain by hard phyllitic shale, argillite, quartzite or igneous rock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, escarpments, mountains and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
