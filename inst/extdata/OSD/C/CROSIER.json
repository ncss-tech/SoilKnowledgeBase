  "OVERVIEW": "The Crosier series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till on till plains and moraines. They are moderately deep to dense till. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
