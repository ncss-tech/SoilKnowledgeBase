  "OVERVIEW": "The Cyclone series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess or silty material and in the underlying drift. Cyclone soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
