  "OVERVIEW": "The Citivar series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and local alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from red silty calcareous shale.  Citivar soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hillslopes on mountains.  Slopes range from 6 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
