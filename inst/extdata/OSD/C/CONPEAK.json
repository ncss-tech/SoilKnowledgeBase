  "OVERVIEW": "The Conpeak series consists of well drained soils, shallow to soft bedrock.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived dominantly from soft sandstone.  Conpeak soils are on hillslopes, ridges, and dissected pediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 8 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  Pebbles of semiconsolidated sandstone and siltstone range from 10 to 60 percent in the control section but break down upon pretreatment.  Hard, consolidated coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  The control section is loam or fine sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 45 percent silt, and 45 to 80 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is mildly through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk calcic horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent in the less than 20 mm. fraction.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through strongly alkaline."

The slope gradient is commonly 5 to 20 percent but ranges from 2 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived dominantly from sandstone and siltstone.  Rock outcrops are common.  Elevation is 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 33 to 41 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with the majority falling as snow in November through May 15, but these areas are windswept and only that precipitation falling in April and May enters the soil.  Estimated frost-free season is 40 to 80 days."
