The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are moist throughout the profiles during the winter.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section commonly are 50 to 75 percent but in some pedons are as low as 35 percent.  The control section averages about 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe BC and C horizons has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam or very cobbly or extremely cobbly clay loam with 20 to 40 percent cobbles and 20 to 35 percent gravel.  It is strongly to slightly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Coyata soils are hillslopes and plateaus in mountainous uplands at elevations of 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from basic igneous bedrock.  They are in a subhumid climate with dry hot summers and warm wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F; the mean January temperature is 25 to 32 degrees F; and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
