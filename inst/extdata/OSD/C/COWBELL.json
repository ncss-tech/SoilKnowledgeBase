Boulderfan soils have an apparent water table at depths of 3.5 to 5 feet.  Euell soils are deep to lithic contacts and have an ustic moisture regime.  Fendersflat and Tusune soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Hardshoulder soils have accumulations of secondary silica.  Lastsummer soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have accumulations of secondary silica.  Pyropatti soils soils are deep to paralithic contacts."

These soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, tuff, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 5,260 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
