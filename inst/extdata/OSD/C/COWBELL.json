  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowbell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, tuff, and volcanic ash.  Cowbell soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
