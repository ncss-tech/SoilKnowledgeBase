  "OVERVIEW": "The Chipley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very rapid or rapidly permeable soils on uplands in the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in thick deposits of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",
