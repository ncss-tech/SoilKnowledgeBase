Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the A horizon except where limed and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Where value is 3.5 or less, thickness is less than 10 inches. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, red, brown or yellow range from few to many.  Some pedons have a few streaks of gray to light gray uncoated sand grains along root channels in the upper part of the C horizon.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 8.
