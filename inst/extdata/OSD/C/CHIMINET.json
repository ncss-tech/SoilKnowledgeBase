They formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived mainly from volcanic tuff of the Bandelier Formation.  Slope is 3 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 5,900 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 125 to 160 days."

The tuff from which this soil is derived is not strongly lithified, and even when not weathered it is only moderately cemented.\nParticle-size control section: from 0 to 6 inches.\nSeries control section: from 0 to 16 inches.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe classification was changed in 9/2006 from Loamy, mixed (nonacid), mesic, shallow Typic Ustorthents to Ashy, glassy, nonacid, mesic, shallow Vitritorrandic Ustorthents.\nThe 12/2007 revision moves the type location from the Rio Arriba Area to the typical pedon used in the soil survey of Bandelier National Monument.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
