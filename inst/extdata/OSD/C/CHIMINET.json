  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiminet series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived mainly from tuff.  They are on interfluves on plateaus and mesas and on canyons, and have slopes of 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The tuff from which this soil is derived is not strongly lithified, and even when not weathered it is only moderately cemented.\nParticle-size control section: from 0 to 6 inches.\nSeries control section: from 0 to 16 inches.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe classification was changed in 9/2006 from Loamy, mixed (nonacid), mesic, shallow Typic Ustorthents to Ashy, glassy, nonacid, mesic, shallow Vitritorrandic Ustorthents.\nThe 12/2007 revision moves the type location from the Rio Arriba Area to the typical pedon used in the soil survey of Bandelier National Monument."
