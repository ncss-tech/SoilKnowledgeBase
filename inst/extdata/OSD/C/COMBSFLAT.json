  "OVERVIEW": "The Combsflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from rhyolite and basalt.  Combsflat soils are in depressions and on benches on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
