  "OVERVIEW": "The Calera series consists of well to somewhat excessively drained Rendzina soils (see remarks) developed from hard limestone.  They occur on sloping to very steep topography under shrub vegetation.  Characteristically the soils have very dark grayish brown, neutral or calcareous, granular A horizons which grade into brown or yellowish brown, calcareous C horizons.  The soils are medium or moderately fine textured.  The Calera soils are mapped in the central Coast Range Mountains of California where they are not important for agriculture.\nThe Calera soils usually occur at elevations below 1,500 feet in a subhumid mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 22 to 30 inches with warm, dry summers and cool, moist, winters; an average January temperature of about 50 degrees F.; an average July temperature of about 57 degrees F; a mean annual temperature of about 53 degrees F.; and a frost free season of over 250 days.\nThe Calera soils occur in the same general area as the Gazos, Montara, and Sweeney soils.  The Permanente soils are also developed on limestone but are stony and shallow and brown (7.5YR) to reddish brown.",
