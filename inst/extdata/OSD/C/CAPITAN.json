  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact is 4 to 18 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F and usually the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil below a depth of about 5 inches usually is dry all of the time from May until November or early December and usually is moist all the rest of the year.  Fragments of conglomerate or calcareous shale average 35 to 65 percent of the volume of the soil profile.\nThe A horizon is gray or dark gray and has chroma of less than 2.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  It has moderate or strong granular structure.  The A horizon rests directly on soft calcareous conglomerate or shale."

Crow Hill and Santa Lucia soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Lodo soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Maymen soils have an ochric epipedon and an annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F."

The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with cool to warm rainless but foggy summers near the coast and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F, the average July temperature is 63 to 68 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.
