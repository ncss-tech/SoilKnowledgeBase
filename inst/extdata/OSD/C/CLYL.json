  "OVERVIEW": "The Clyl series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from dolomitic limestone.  Clyl soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
