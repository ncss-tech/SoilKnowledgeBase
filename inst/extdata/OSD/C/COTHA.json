  "OVERVIEW": "The Cotha series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft, noncalcareous sandstone. Cotha soils are on rolling uplands and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
