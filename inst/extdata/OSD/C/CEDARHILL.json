  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and ridges, foothills, and terraces.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone and related sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F.",

Hondoho soils are noncalcareous in the A horizon or at least its upper part.  Ireland and Ridgecrest soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Ricrest soils are fine-loamy.  Watercanyon and Ririe soils formed in loess and are coarse-silty.  Hondoho and Ricrest soils are in concave positions or on north and east-facing slopes when associated with Cedarhill soils.  Ridgecrest and Ireland soils are generally on north or east convex slopes when associated with Cedarhill soils.  Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on loess covered slopes and fan terraces."
