  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cedarhill soils are generally on south and west-facing mountain slopes and ridges, foothills, and terraces. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  Elevation is 4,800 to 7,000 feet. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from limestone and related sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."

Hondoho soils are noncalcareous in the A horizon or at least its upper part.  Ireland and Ridgecrest soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Ricrest soils are fine-loamy.  Watercanyon and Ririe soils formed in loess and are coarse-silty.  Hondoho and Ricrest soils are in concave positions or on north and east-facing slopes when associated with Cedarhill soils.  Ridgecrest and Ireland soils are generally on north or east convex slopes when associated with Cedarhill soils.  Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on loess covered slopes and fan terraces."
