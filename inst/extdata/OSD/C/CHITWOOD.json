    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist, is saturated with water extended periods during the winter, and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of about 4 to 12 inches after the summer solstice. Redox depletions with moist chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 18 to 24 inches and represent less than 50 percent of the matrix. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F under canopy cover. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The upper 6 to 10 inches has an estimated Alox +  Feox of 2.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc.  The lower part to a depth of 20 inches, has Alox +  Feox of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc.  Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend below a depth of 14 inches.  A substratum containing paragravel, paracobbles, and parastones is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is dominantly medial silt loam in the upper part and medial silt loam or silt loam in the lower part with 20 to 27 percent clay by field estimate.  A few areas are silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.   It is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 3 moist and dry.  Texture is silty clay loam with 30 to 37 percent clay.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay. It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe BC or C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent paragravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chitwood soils are on coastal marine and valley terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in mixed old fine textured alluvial deposits from sedimentary rocks. Elevations range from 20 to 400 feet. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog and low clouds. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The average January temperature is 43 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 61 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 300 days. These soils are on the Whiskey Run geomorphic surface."

Knappa soils are well drained and have a texture control section that averages less than 35 percent clay.  Hebo soils are on concave areas of terraces and Knappa soils are on nearly level to convex areas of terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from the surface to 19 inches (Ap, A and BA horizon).\nCambic horizon - from 19 to 29 inches (Bw horizon)\nAquic feature  common redox depletions beginning at a depth of 19 inches (Bw horizons).\nAndic subgroup feature - from 0 to 11 inches (Ap and A horizon) qualifying for andic soil properties.  Based on data from NSSL sample S02OR-007-002 and on data collected for similar soils.\nA proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
