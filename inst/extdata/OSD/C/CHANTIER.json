  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to shale ranges from about 10 to 20 inches.  Typically the soil contains carbonate throughout but some pedons are leached to 3 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Soil colors are mostly inherited from the parent shale.  The control section typically has about 65 percent clay but the surface ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Electrical conductivity within 5 inches of the surface is 4 to 16 mmhos/cm.  The soil ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Both dry and moist colors on faces of peds in the A horizon ranges from 1/2 to 1 value darker than the crushed peds.  A porous surface, crust 1/8 to 1 inch thick, often forms upon drying but parts easily to granules.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has few nests of gypsum and other salts, but some pedons do not have salts in the upper part.\nThe Bz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has common to many nests of gypsum and other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It contains as much as 50 percent by volume of fragments of soft shale.  White or olive colored bentonitic shale layers 1 to 6 inches thick are in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon is clay shale.  Yellowish brown and brownish yellow stains are common along fracture faces of shale fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chantier soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 25 percent.  Some landscapes have slight gilagi microrelief.  The soil formed in clay residuum weathered from shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Dupree soils and the Bullcreek, Okaton, Opal, and Sansarc soils.  Bullcreek soils are on toe slopes and flats below the Chantier soils and have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Dupree, Opal, and Sansarc soils are on similar landscapes.  Opal soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have less salts.  Okaton soils are on crests, knolls, and ridges above Chantier soils.  Okaton soils contain more carbonate and are less dense.  Sansarc soils have lower electrical conductivity, contain less visible salts, and are less dense."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Surface runoff is high on the lower slopes and very high on the more sloping areas.  Permeability is very slow, except after dry periods when initial intake may be rapid due to cracks in the soil."
