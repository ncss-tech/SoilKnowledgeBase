Rock fragments, mainly less than 3 inches in diameter, range from 5 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and may be modified by rock fragments. Sand content ranges from 20 to 52 percent with less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Reaction is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral."

Elevation is 6,800 to 9.500 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is estimated at less than 90 days."
