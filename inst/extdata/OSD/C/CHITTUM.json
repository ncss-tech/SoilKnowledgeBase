  "STATES": "CO,UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chittum series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to hard bedrock. They formed in material weathered from sandstone. Chittum soils are on hill backslopes and footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Rock fragments, mainly less than 3 inches in diameter, range from 5 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and may be modified by rock fragments. Sand content ranges from 20 to 52 percent with less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Reaction is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral."
