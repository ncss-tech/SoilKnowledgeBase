  "OVERVIEW": "The Caseycreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash. These soils are on stream terraces. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
