  "OVERVIEW": "The Clawson series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from granitic rocks.  Clawson soils are on low stream terraces, alluvial fans, and in drainageways with slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 18 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has common to many, distinct or prominent redox concentrations.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam with 8 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has common to many, faint to prominent redox concentrations.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam to a depth of 40 inches.  Below this depth, the C horizon is stratified coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, or loam.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel."

The soils formed in alluvium weathered typically from granite and diorite with some areas having other mixed rock sources.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 40 inches.  In the interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is typically 52 to 54 degrees F., but ranges to 56 degrees F. in Curry County, Oregon.  The frost-free period is 140 to 210 days."

Central Point soils are well drained.  Tallowbox soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock."
