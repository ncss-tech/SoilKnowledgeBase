  "OVERVIEW": "The Cobb series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
