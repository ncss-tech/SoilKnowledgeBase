  "OVERVIEW": "The Chazner series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to an indurated calcium carbonate hardpan. They formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and sandstone on treads of fan terraces.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
