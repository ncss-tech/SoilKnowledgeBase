    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chazner soils are on treads of fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from calcareous Tertiary quartz diorite and Jurassic sandstone.  Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
