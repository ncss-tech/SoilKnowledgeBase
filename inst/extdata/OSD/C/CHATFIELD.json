  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 97 cm. Depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm from the mineral soil surface. Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent by volume in the A horizon and from 5 to 35 percent in the B and C horizons. Rock fragments are typically gravel or channers, but include cobbles, stones, boulders and flagstones, particularly just above the bedrock.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is slightly, intermediately, and/or highly decomposed plant material. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A, or Ap horizon where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Dry value is 6 or higher. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon commonly has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and includes 7.5YR when a high ratio of ammonium oxalate extractable iron to dithionite-citrate extractable iron (greater than 0.15) exists, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is similar to the A horizon.  The Bw horizon has subangular blocky or granular structure and is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with color and texture similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, and the 7.5YR hue is limited to horizons having a high ratio of ammonium oxalate extractable iron to dithionite-citrate extractable iron (> 0.15). Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction and may have lenses or pockets of loamy sand. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. It is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly through moderately acid.\nThe 2R horizon is dominantly schist, granite, or gneiss bedrock. In places it is massive, but it dominantly has vertical and horizontal fractures in the upper 30 to 76 cm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chadakoin, Charlton, Maplecrest, Riverhead, Stinger, and Valois series.  Chadakoin, Maplecrest, and Valois soils formed in till derived primary from sedimentary rock parent materials and are greater than 100 cm to bedrock.  Charlton soils formed in similar parent material to that of Chatfield but are greater than 150 cm to bedrock.  Riverhead soils formed in glacial outwash deposits and are greater than 100 cm to bedrock.  Stinger soils are not from Region R and have a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chatfield soils are nearly level through very steep, and are on bedrock-controlled glaciated upland landscapes. The soils formed in a moderately thick mantle of melt-out till overlying granite, gneiss, or schist bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 1270 mm, mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C, and the frost free season ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 0 to 305 meters above sea level."

Brimfield, Brookfield and Nipmuck soils formed in sulfur bearing parent materials and have a ratio of ammonium oxalate extractable iron to dithionite-citrate extractable iron less than 0.15 and have pedogenic iron contents greater than 1 percent throughout the pedon. Brookfield, Charlton, Narragansett, and Paxton soils are very deep soils. Cardigan soils are moderately deep soils that formed in till derived from phyllite, slate, shale, and schist.  Hollis soils are shallow to bedrock and are on nearby ridge crests and areas adjacent to rock outcrops."

Some small cleared areas are used for pasture, are idle, or are sites for residential and recreational development."
