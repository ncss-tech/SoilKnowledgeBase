  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils typically have from 2 to 25 percent by volume of coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Coarse fragments are of mixed lithology and range from gravel to cobblestone in size. The pedon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 1 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically it is sandy loam but fine sandy loam and loam are within the range.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The B horizon has faint through prominent mottles.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam but includes thin subhorizons of loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4 with faint through prominent mottles.  It is typically sandy loam but includes fine sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clotho soils have plane or slightly convex slopes on rims of interdrumlins and rises along edges or in depressions. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in sandy loam glacial till of the Wadena lobe of the late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blowers, Kandota, Paddock, Rockwood, Runeberg, and Wykeham soils which are members of a drainage sequence.  The well drained Kandota and Rockwood soils are on convex side slopes of drumlins and ground moraines.  The moderately well drained Blowers and Wykeham soils are located on slightly convex to slightly concave positions on drumlins and ground moraines.  The somewhat poorly drained Paddock soils are located on plane or slightly concave positions at the bases of slopes and heads of shallow drainageways in drumlins and ground moraines.  The very poorly and poorly drained Runeberg soils are located on concave positions in low lying areas between drumlins and ground moraines."
