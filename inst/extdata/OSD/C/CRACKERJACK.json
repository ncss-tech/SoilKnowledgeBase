Fortirwin soils are on broad fan remnants of predominantly igneous alluvium and have an argillic horizon and an indurated duripan. Tenwell soils are on remnants on lower slopes of ballenas and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and a duripan below 20 inches. Yermo soils are on alluvial fans and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section."
