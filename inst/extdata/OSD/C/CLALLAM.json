Clallam soils formed in glacial till over very compact dense glacial till.  The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches.  Average January temperature is about 37 degrees F, average July temperature is about 59 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."

Agnew soils have an argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained.  Bellingham soils have an aquic moisture regime and a fine particle-size class.  Catla soils are loamy and have a densic contact at 10 to 20 inches.  Elwha soils are coarse-loamy.  Hoypus soils are sandy-skeletal.  Louella soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon.  McKenna soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Yeary soils are fine-loamy."

Understory species include salal, evergreen huckleberry, red huckleberry, Oregongrape, creambush oceanspray, longtube twinflower, rose, blackberry, western swordfern, and western brackenfern.  Principal crops are alfalfa and grass hay, barley, oats, strawberries, raspberries, and pasture."
