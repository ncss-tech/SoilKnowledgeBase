  "OVERVIEW": "The Clallam series consists of moderately deep to densic materials, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till over very compact glacial till.  These soils are on glaciated hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
