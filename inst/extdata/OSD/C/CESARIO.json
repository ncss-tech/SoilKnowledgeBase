These soils formed in residuum derived from the Cretaceous Age Pen Clay Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, with most occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 260 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Cheosa soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, and are in the skeletal family.  They are on hillcrests capped with the Jeff Conglomerate member of the Pruett Formation.  Fizzleflat soils are on similar upland plains and pediments.  Loyplace soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, and have shale within 40 inches of the soil surface.  They are on slightly higher caliche-cemented footslope landforms.  Mariscal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are very shallow and shallow to Boquillas Flag limestone bedrock, and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that do not have a calcic horizon and are on alluvial flats and floodplains."
