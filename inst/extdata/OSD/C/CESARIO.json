  "OVERVIEW": "The Cesario series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils over slowly permeable shale.  These soils are on nearly level to gently undulating upland plains and pediments.  They formed in residuum derived from the Cretaceous Pen Clay Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",

Fizzleflat soils are on similar upland plains and pediments.  Loyplace soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, and have shale within 40 inches of the soil surface.  They are on slightly higher caliche-cemented footslope landforms.  Mariscal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are very shallow and shallow to Boquillas Flag limestone bedrock, and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that do not have a calcic horizon and are on alluvial flats and floodplains."
