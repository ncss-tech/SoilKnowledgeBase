  "OVERVIEW": "The Chivers series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly  drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Chivers soils are in drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
