  "OVERVIEW": "The Cairn series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium, alluvium and residuum derived from limestone and sandstone on summits of structural benches and dipslopes of gently dipping cuestas.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
