  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Electrical conductivities of the saturation extract ranges from about 0.2 to 2 millimhos in the A horizon; 1.0 to 4.0 millimhos in the upper Bt horizon; 4.0 to 12.0 in the lower Bt and C horizons.  COLE of the control section ranges from .07 to .09.\nThe A and Bt horizons are dark gray, very dark gray, gray or dark grayish brown in hue of 10YR, values of 3 and 4, and chroma of 1 and 2.  The Bt horizons are also grayish brown, brown, or pale brown in hue of 10YR, values of 5 and 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. The A horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  The boundary between the A and Bt horizons is abrupt or clear with a clay increase of 20 to 30 percent in the upper Bt horizon. The Bt horizons are clay or clay loam.\nThe Btyz horizons are dark gray, gray, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, brown, and pale brown in hue of 10YR; values of 5 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 3.  They are loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and clay content decreases with depth.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Byz horizon is pale brown, very pale brown, or light yellowish brown in hue of 10YR;  It is value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 3 and 4. Clay loam,clay, or clay loam intermingled with soft shale fragments that slake in water. It contains common to many accumulations of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and other salts.\nThe C horizon where present is similar to the Byz but has higher color values. It has few to common streaks with colors of the Bt horizons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Altita soils occur as micro-highs in a complex with Charco soil that occur in micro-depressions.  Amphion, Chacon, Cotulla, and Hanis soils occur on similar landscapes to Charco soils.  Cotulla soils have more than 35 percent clay throughout.  Divot soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and occur on bottomlands derived from sediments from areas of limestone.  Moglia soils occur on slightly higher landscapes and have less clayey subsoils."
