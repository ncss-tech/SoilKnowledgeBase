  "BYREV": "Rev. JAL-SRS-LDC",
  "REVDATE": "07/2014",
  "STATES": "IL,IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clinton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on convex summits of interfluves, upper side slopes on uplands, and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
