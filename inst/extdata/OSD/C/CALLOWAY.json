Combined thickness of horizons having less than 10 percent sand is more than 48 inches. Black and brown concretions range from few to many in all horizons. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum. The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Ap or E horizons, where present' have hue 10YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma 2 to 4. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 through 6, and chroma 4 through 6. Few to many clay depletions in shades of gray are present. In some pedons the horizon is variegated in shades of gray and brown. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay content from a depth of 10 inches to the upper boundary of the fragipan ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe E'g horizon, where present has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma 1 or 2; or hue 10YR, value 6 or 7, and chroma 3. In some pedons, the E' horizon is lacking and a mixed E/B or B/E horizon is above the fragipan. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Btx or Btx/E horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Material in the prisms is brittle and firm or very firm in more than 60 percent of the volume. Silt coatings on prism faces or intrusions of albic material are friable and are light brownish gray, gray, or light gray. Roots are primarily restricted to the friable material between prisms."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Necessity and Olivier series in the same family and the Bude, Edisto, Grenada, Pheba, and Splendora series in closely related families. Necessity and Bude soils have similar morphology but contain more than 10 percent fine sand and coarser to a depth of 48 inches. In addition, Necessity soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces on former channels of the Arkansas River.  Edisto soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Grenada soils do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches'. Olivier soils have a Bt horizon at least 8 inches thick with less than 15 percent albic intrusions above the fragipan. Pheba soils have 10 to 18 percent clay between 10 inches and the upper boundary of the fragipan and also have lower base saturation. Splendora soils have more than 15 percent fine and coarse sand in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Calloway soils are on the smoother portions of the loess belt of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands including areas on the stream terraces. The dominant slope gradient is between 0 and 3 percent but may range to 5 percent. The regolith is thick silty loess or water reworked loess deposits with low sand content. The climate is warm and humid with an annual average rainfall of 50 inches, average January temperature of 48 degrees Fahrenheit, and average July temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit at the type location."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calhoun, Feliciana, Grenada, Henry, Loring, and Memphis soils. Calhoun soils are grayer, do not have a fragipan, and are in depressions and flat areas with 1 percent slopes or less. Grenada and Loring soils are browner, do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches, and are on higher positions. Henry soils are in depressions and drainageways, are grayer and poorly drained. Feliciana and Memphis soils do not have a fragipan, are well drained, and are in higher positions."

The soil is saturated in the layers below 1 to 2 feet deep and above the fragipan during January through April in normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Calloway soils are cleared and used for such crops as cotton, corn, soybeans, and pasture. A small acreage is in mixed hardwoods, chiefly water oak, sweetgum, blackgum, post oak, hickory, and other water tolerant species. Shortleaf and loblolly pine are in the southern part of the range."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was reclassified from a Glossaquic Fragiudalf to an Aquic Fragiudalf in 2001 because the former classification was removed from taxonomy.  The classification was changed to an Aquic Fraglossudalf in 2002 based on observations at the type location pedon and other survey area typical pedon sites which indicated these soils typically have a Glossic horizon above the fragipan.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 6 inches (A, E).\nFragipan - the zone from 30 to 53 inches (Btx1).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 1 to 6 inches (E) and the zone from 19 to 30 inches (E').\nGlossic Horizon - the zone from 6 to 19 inches (Bt/E horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 19 inches (Bt/E) and the zone from 30 to 60 inches.\nAquic conditions - saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features including iron or clay depletions with chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the Argillic horizon at 6 to 16 inches deep (Bt/E horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Physical and chemical analyses for one pedon in Soil Survey of Madison County, Mississippi; Engineering test data for one pedon in Soil Survey of De Soto County, Mississippi.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
