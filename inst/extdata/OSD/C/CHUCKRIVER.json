  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuckriver series consists of shallow to bedrock, poorly drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from phyllite and schist on hillslopes and mountainslopes.  Slopes range from 55 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 5 to 14 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reactions increase with depth, ranging from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the surface layers, and from moderately acid to slightly acid in the subsoil.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nAn Oi or Oe horizon may be present in some pedons.  The combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 8 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value from 2 to 3 and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue from 10YR to 5Y, value from 2 to 4 and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Prominent or distinct mottles are commonly present at the lower depths.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons.  Hue is 2.5Y or 5Y; value ranges from 4 to 6 and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.  Mottles are commonly present."
