  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 5 to 14 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reactions increase with depth, ranging from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the surface layers, and from moderately acid to slightly acid in the subsoil.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nAn Oi or Oe horizon may be present in some pedons.  The combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 8 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value from 2 to 3 and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue from 10YR to 5Y, value from 2 to 4 and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Prominent or distinct mottles are commonly present at the lower depths.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons.  Hue is 2.5Y or 5Y; value ranges from 4 to 6 and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.  Mottles are commonly present."

The parent material is colluvium and residuum from phyllite and schist underlain by phyllite and schist bedrock.  The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation range of 60 to 220 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 1500 feet."

Fordsterror soils lack a histic epipedon, are somewhat poorly drained and are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Kaikli soils are very poorly drained organic soils. Snettisham soils lack a histic epipedon and are somewhat poorly drained."
