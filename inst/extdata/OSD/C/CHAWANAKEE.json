The soils formed in material weathered from quartz diorite and granodiorite low in mafic minerals. Elevations are 615 to 2,250 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 635 to 2350 mm, of which 2 to 30 percent occurs as snow. Mean January air temperature is about 4 degrees C; mean July air temperature is about 21 degrees C; mean annual air temperature is 8 to 15 degrees C. Frost-free season is about 120 to 245 days."
