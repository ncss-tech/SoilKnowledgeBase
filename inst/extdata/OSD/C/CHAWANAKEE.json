  "OVERVIEW": "The Chawanakee series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic rock. Chawanakee soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 2 to 110 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm and the mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C.",
