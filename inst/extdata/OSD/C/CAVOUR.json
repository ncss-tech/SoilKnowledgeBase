    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 35 inches.  Depth to accumulations of gypsum and other salts ranges from 16 to 45 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is over 16 inches but ranges from 7 to 35 inches.  The natric horizon has an estimated SAR or ESP of 10 to 20.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist.  It typically is loam or silt loam, but is clay loam in some pedons.  Some pedons have up to 25 percent stones on the surface.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam, but is fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  When cultivated, the A and E horizons become mixed.\nThe Btn and Btnyz horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist; and chroma of 3 or less.  They are clay loam, clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam averaging between 35 to 50 percent clay with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline. Accumulations of gypsum and other salts are not present in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons.\nThe Byz horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have gypsum accumulations.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Some Bk horizons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Accumulations of gypsum and other salts are few to common in the C horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cavour soils are on uplands having plane and slightly convex slopes. Slope gradients typically are 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  Cavour soils formed in firm loam and clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2800."

Forman soils are on higher positions on the landscape.  Peever soils are on similar nearby level landscapes and on slight rises.  Parnell and Tonka soils are very poorly and poorly drained and are in closed depressions."
