  "OVERVIEW": "The Cramont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over material weathered from basalt.  Cramont soils are on basalt plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
