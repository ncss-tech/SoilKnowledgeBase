  "OVERVIEW": "The Craters series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in reworked ash and cinders. Permeability is moderate. These soils are on fan terraces and along mountain valley drainages.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
