  "REVDATE": "06/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Celacy series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed mainly in alluvium and eolian material derived from interbedded sandstone and shale on bedrock controlled plains and mesa tops.  The slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
