  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  About half of the pedons do not have a recognizable discontinuity.  Reaction of the profile is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 20 percent coarse angular pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 14 percent.  This horizon is noncalcareous in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam modified with 5 to 25 percent coarse angular pebbles and 0 to 10 percent small angular cobbles.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  About half of the pedons have transitional Btk horizons with small concretions and thin pendants of calcium carbonate on undersides of the rock fragments.  The Btk horizons may contain up to 40 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent pebbles, 25 to 60 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent flagstones.  Matrix texture is very fine sandy loam with 4 to 12 percent clay.  Secondary calcium carbonate occurs as many small concretions and as thin to thick pendants on the cobbles.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 17 to 32 percent by volume."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canwall soils are on nearly level to steep cuesta dipslopes, north-facing canyon walls, and structural benches.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in aeolian and colluvial material overlying residuum from limestone.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and ranges from 10 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow and rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is approximately 60 to 90 days."
