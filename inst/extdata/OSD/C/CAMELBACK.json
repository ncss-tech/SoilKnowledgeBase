  "OVERVIEW": "The Camelback series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mountain slopes, foothills, and fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks, dominantly quartzite.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 18 inches and the average annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
