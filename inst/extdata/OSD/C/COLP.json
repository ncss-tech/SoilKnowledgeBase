Some pedons have an A horizon as much as 5 inches in thickness with color value of 3. The Ap or A horizon typically is silt loam, but some eroded areas are silty clay loam. Sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid except pedons that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe second part of the sries control section (E horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 (6 through 8 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. Clay content averages 18 to 25 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid, but pedons that have been limed range to neutral. Some pedons that are eroded or cultivated deeply do not have an E horizon.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon as much as 8 inches in thickness that is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe third part of the series control section (2Bt horizon) typically has hue of 10YR, and less commonly 7.5YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have thin strata or redoximorphic concentrations that have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. The 2Bt horizon typically is silty clay loam or silty clay but some subhorizons are clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons contain carbonates.\nThe fourth part of the series control section (2Btg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have variegated colors with chroma of 3 or 4 and some pedons have thin subhorizons or redoximorphic concentrations that have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR. The 2Btg horizon has textures in the same range as stated for the 2Bt horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons contain carbonates.\nThe lower part of the series control section has properties as follows: The 2BCtkg, 2BC, or 2BCg horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to those previously stated for the 2Bt and 2Btg horizon. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to neutral, and less commonly ranges to moderately alkaline. In some pedons it is stratified with layers of silt loam or fine sandy loam. Carbonates are common, but are not everywhere present. The 2C or 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8 and has redoximorphic features. It typically is silt clay loam or silty clay and is stratified in some pedons with layers of silt loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Carbonates are common, but are not everywhere present."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Galland, Gorin, Keswick, Marion and Weller series.  Galland soils formed in alluvium that contains a paleosol on high structural benches; they contain more than 15 percent sand throughout the soil and have redder colors dominating the matrix or the mottles in some part of the Bt horizon. Gorin soils have more than 30 inches of loess and contain more sand in the lower part of the solum. Keswick soils formed mostly in glacial till that contains a paleosol and have hue of 5YR or redder dominating the matrix or the mottles in the Bt horizon. Marion soils have less than 35 percent clay in some horizon in the lower part of the series control section. Weller soils formed entirely in loess and contain less than 5 percent sand throughout and less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colp soils are on convex treads and sloping risers of lacustrine terraces and lake plains; mainly along major tributaries of the Mississippi River.  Some areas are subject to rare or occasional flooding during high flood events.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Colp soils formed in the dominantly clayey lacustrine sediments and have a mantle of loess or other silty material less than 20 inches in thickness.  The lacustrine sediments in and underlying the Colp series are weathered to depths of 10 or 12 feet.  Below 80 inches the stratified lacustrine sediments have coarse structure and widely-spaced cleavage planes, slickensides and pressure faces, clay films on faces of structural units and in channels, segregation of iron-manganese oxides, accumulation of secondary carbonates, and the presence of dark strata.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Geff, Hurst, Okaw, Ridgway, Redbud, and Wagner series.  The somewhat poorly drained Hurst soils are on less sloping parts of the same landform.  The somewhat poorly drained Geff soils and the well drained Ridgway soils contain less clay and more sand in the control section and are on high flood plains and stream terraces nearby.  The poorly drained Okaw and Wagner soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of the same landform.  Okaw and Hurst soils form a hydrosequence with Colp soils in similar materials.  The moderately well drained Redbud soils occur on loess-covered lacustrine terraces nearby."
