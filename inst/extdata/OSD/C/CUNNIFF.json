    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 45 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent gravel, and 0 to 30 percent soft rock fragments.  The fragments are weathered sandstone or siltstone and can be crushed.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  The profile is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is silty clay loam averaging 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent soft rock fragments.  Organic matter is 5 to 8 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay averaging 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent soft rock fragments.  Organic matter is 2 to 5 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly silty clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam averaging 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent soft rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cunniff soils are on broad tops and side slopes of dissected high marine terraces and remnant high stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in marine sediments or alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevation is 200 to 600 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 300 days.  Cunniff soils are on the Seven Devils geomorphic surface (marine terrace position) or the equivalent Dolph geomorphic surface (high terrace position)."

Horseprairie soils are on adjacent lower marine terraces, are fine-loamy, have a cambic horizon, and an umbric epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick.  Joeney soils are on marine terraces, have a spodic horizon, 10 to 20 inches deep to an ortstein layer, and are poorly drained."
