Ireland soils formed in alluvium and residuum of calcareous rocks, have limestone coarse fragments, have higher annual precipitation with more summer rain and greater snow accumulation in the winter, and have a winter soil temperature greater than 0 degrees C. Jebo soils have 7.5YR and 5YR colors in the B horizon. Pedleford soils have less than 60 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the profile and are on basalt plains."

The soil formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite and mica-schist with loess influence. The average annual precipitation is about 360 to 460 mm, the average annual air temperature is about 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."

The soil moisture regime should be checked for the possibility of an aridic bordering on xeric.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
