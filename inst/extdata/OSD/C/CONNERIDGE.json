  "OVERVIEW": "The Conneridge series consists of moderately deep, well-drained, that are formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite and mica-schist with some loess influence. They are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of  10 to 55 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
