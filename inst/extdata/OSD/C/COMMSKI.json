  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 2,200 to 4,400 feet. The climate is typical of the Mojave Desert with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 180 to 250 days."
