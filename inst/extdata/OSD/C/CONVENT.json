  "OVERVIEW": "The Convent series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in recent loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping natural levee positions on flood plains, mainly along the Mississippi River and its distributaries. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Adler soils do not have aquic conditions within the upper 20 inches of the solum. Commerce soils have a fine-silty control section. Falaya and McRaven soils are on flood plains of upland streams and have a buried subsoil.  In addition, Falaya soils are more acid. Vacherie soils have a clayey discontinuity within a depth of 40 inches.  Waverly soils are on upland streams or alluvial fans and have an active activity class."
