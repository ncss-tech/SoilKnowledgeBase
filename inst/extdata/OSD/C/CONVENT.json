Many pedons have carbonates in some strata below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of gray are present in some pedons. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nA thin AB or Bw horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 is present in some pedons.  It has common to many iron depletions and masses of iron accumulation. Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Where present, the horizon does not extend deeper than 16 inches below the surface.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of gray range from few to many. Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, however the range also includes value 6 in the lower part. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of gray range from few to many. Some pedons have thin strata with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4; hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 to 4; or hue of 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 that comprise up to 40 percent of the 10 to 40 inch control section. Some pedons have thin subhorizons with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or value of 5 and chroma of 3. Texture dominantly is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam, but some pedons have thin strata of finer or coarser material.\nAn Ab horizon is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons. The Ab horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Adler, Commerce, Falaya, McRaven, Vacherie, and Waverly series are in closely related families. Adler soils do not have aquic conditions within the upper 20 inches of the solum. Commerce soils have a fine-silty control section. Falaya and McRaven soils are on flood plains of upland streams and have a buried subsoil.  In addition, Falaya soils are more acid. Vacherie soils have a clayey discontinuity within a depth of 40 inches.  Waverly soils are on upland streams or alluvial fans and have an active activity class."

The soil formed in recent loamy alluvium. Most areas are protected from flooding by levees. The climate is humid temperate. Near the type location, mean annual precipitation is 60 inches and mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F."

Bruin soils have a cambic horizon and do not have aquic conditions within the upper 20 inches. Crevasse soils are sandy throughout. Mhoon soils have a fine-silty control section and have dominant chroma 1 colors throughout the substratum. Morganfield soils are browner throughout and do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches. Newelton soils have a clayey solum that extends to a depth of 12 to 20 inches. Sharkey soils are clayey throughout. Tunica soils have a clayey solum that extends to a depth of 20 to 36 inches."
