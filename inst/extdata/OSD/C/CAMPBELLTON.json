  "BYREV": "Rev. WJG-CNL-CKH",
  "REVDATE": "11/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Campbellton series consist of soils that are very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils, derived from calcareous clayey or loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and claystone like those of the Whitsett Formation of Oligocene age. These soils are on side slopes or shoulders of interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
