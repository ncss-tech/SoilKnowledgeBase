    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Concord soils are on terraces at elevations between 150 and 400 feet. Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent but may reach 2 percent. The soils formed in stratified silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits of mixed mineralogy. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.

Dayton soils have an abrupt textural change between the albic and argillic horizons and occur in depressions on terraces. Aloha soils are fine-silty and have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Amity soils are fine-silty and have a mollic epipedon. Holcomb soils have a mollic epipedon and have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Willamette and Woodburn soils are fine-silty and are on higher terraces."
