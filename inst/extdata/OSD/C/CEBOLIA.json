  "OVERVIEW": "The Cebolia series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed mainly in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep alluvial fans, till plains, mountainsides and valley side slopes.  The average annual precipitation at the type location is 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 36 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent and increases as depth increases.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material usually ranges from 10 to 40 inches, and is not deeper than the upper boundary to the C horizon if the solum is thicker than 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above depth of 50 inches and range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is 51 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue from 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 55 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt, and 15 to 50 percent sand, more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has more than 35 percent clay to a depth in excess of 50 inches.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction."
