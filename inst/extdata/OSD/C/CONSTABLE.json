    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 56 through 130 centimeters (22 through 51 inches). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters (60 inches). Rock fragments range from 5 through 35 percent by volume in the O, A, and E horizons, from 10 through 52 percent in the subsoil above a depth of 51 centimeters (20 inches), and from 35 through 75 percent below a depth of 51 centimeters. It consists of mainly gravels and cobbles. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid throughout but includes ultra acid in the O horizons.\nThe O horizon has a hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is composed of slightly through highly decomposed organic materials. Consistence is very friable and structure is either granular or it is massive.\nThe Ap, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from sand through fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It is weak or moderate, very fine through medium granular or it is massive. Consistence is loose through friable.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2. Texture of the fine earth fraction is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Structure is subangular blocky, or it is massive or single grain. Consistence is loose, very friable, or friable.\nThe Bh horizon has a hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine earth fraction is sand or loamy sand.  Structure is subangular blocky or granular, or it is massive. Consistence ranges from very friable through firm.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is sand. Structure is weak subangular blocky or granular, or it is massive. Consistence ranges from friable through firm.\nThe Bhsm horizon has a hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sand or sand. It is massive. Consistence ranges from very firm through rigid and is  and weakly to very strongly cemented.\nSome pedons have a Bsm horizon with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sand or sand. It is massive. Consistence ranges from very firm through rigid and is and weakly to very strongly cemented.\nThe Bs horizon has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sand or sand. It is commonly massive or single grain, but can be weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. Consistence is friable through loose.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sand or sand. It is stratified, and single grain or massive within strata. Consistence is very friable or loose."
