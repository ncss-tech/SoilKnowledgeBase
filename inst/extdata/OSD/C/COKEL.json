  "OVERVIEW": "The Cokel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium. The Cokel soils are on rolling hills and ridge tops.  Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F.",
