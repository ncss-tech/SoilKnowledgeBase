  "OVERVIEW": "The Cornflat series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in marsh deposited alluvium derived from limestone. The Cornflat soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.",
