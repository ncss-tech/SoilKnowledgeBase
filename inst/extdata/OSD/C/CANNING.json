  "OVERVIEW": "The Canning series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy material on terraces and outwash plains that are moderately deep over sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderate through the solum and rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 19 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly loam.  Carbonates are few to many, fine or medium soft accumulations or striations.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is calcareous gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
