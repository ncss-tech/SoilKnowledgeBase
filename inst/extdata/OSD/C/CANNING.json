  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is from 12 to 25 inches.  Depth to stratified sand and gravel typically is about 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 19 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly loam.  Carbonates are few to many, fine or medium soft accumulations or striations.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is calcareous gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
