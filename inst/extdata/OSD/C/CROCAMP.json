The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.  The solum has a base saturation by NH4OAc is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. The texture is very cobbly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy coarse sandy loam. It is 15 to 30 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones.

Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F. The average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 95 days."
