  "OVERVIEW": "The Crocamp series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from granitic and metamorphic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on back slopes and shoulders of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.  The solum has a base saturation by NH4OAc is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. The texture is very cobbly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy coarse sandy loam. It is 15 to 30 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.
