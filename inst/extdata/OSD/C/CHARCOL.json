    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 34 inches thick. The upper boundary of the B2t horizon is 40 to 60 inches or more below the surface. The combined thickness of the A1, A2 and B2t horizons ranges from 48 to 60 inches or more. The 10- to 40-inch control section contains 35 to 60 percent gravel, cobbles and stones.  The mean annual soil temperature at depths of 20 inches ranges from 42 degrees to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 59 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 30 to 45 days during the late summer.  Rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite or sandstone pebbles and cobbles, and range from 20 to 50 percent in the A1 horizon, 45 to 70 percent in the A2 horizon and 35 to 70 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It ranges from gravelly sandy loam or loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam or very cobbly loam or gravelly fine sandy loam to very stony fine sandy loam. This horizon is medium acid to neutral and is 20 to 34 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 4 through 6 moist. It ranges from cobbly or gravelly, or very cobbly, or very gravelly loam, or sandy loam, to very cobbly loamy sand. This horizon is slightly or medium acid, and is 10 to 35 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has dominant hue of 2.5YR or 10R. Value is 4 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist. This horizon ranges from gravelly or cobbly, or very gravelly or very cobbly clay loam, or gravelly sandy loam to gravelly, very gravelly or very cobbly sandy clay loam. It has weak through strong, fine through coarse subangular blocky structure. Clay films are common to many, thin to moderately thick. The B2t horizon is slightly acid or medium acid."
