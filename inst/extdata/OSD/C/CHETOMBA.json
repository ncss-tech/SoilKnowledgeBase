  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches thick.  The thickness of the upper sediment and depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The particle size control section averages between 22 and 30 percent clay with an extreme range of 18 to 35 percent, and from 3 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  The silty lacustrine sediments typically do not have rock fragments.  The glacial till contains 2 to 10 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2 or a hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam high in content of very fine sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The content of fine sand or coarser is greater than 15 percent."

Madelia and Wacousta soils do not have horizons with greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser within 60 inches of the soil surface.

These soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments overlying calcareous, loamy glacial till.  These sediments are late Wisconsin in age.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 124 to 155.  Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,125 feet above sea level."

Prinsburg soils are poorly drained and occur in similar landscape positions and are calcareous throughout.  Quam soils are very poorly drained and are in closed depressions.  Tara soils are moderately well drained and are on low back slopes or summits."
