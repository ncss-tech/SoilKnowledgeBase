  "OVERVIEW": "The Clovkamp series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on old stream terraces on lava plains.  They formed in volcanic ash over gravelly alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
