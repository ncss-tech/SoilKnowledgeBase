Depth to carbonates and the extremely gravelly layer is 35 to 50 inches.  The soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 120 to 150 days (cumulative).  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The upper part of the particle-size control section contains an average of 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent in the upper part of the profile (A and C horizons).\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Pumice content (0.5 - 2.0 mm) ranges from 40 to 70 percent.  It is neutral throughout.\nThe C horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Pumice content (0.5 - 2.0 mm) ranges from 20 to 50 percent.  It contains 0 to 10 percent basalt gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bq horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is hard and brittle throughout. It is gravelly loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Gravel content is 15 to 25 percent.  It is slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkq horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand.  Gravel content is 65 to 85 percent.  It is very hard and brittle throughout.  Carbonates are present as a thin layer or as coatings on the undersides of gravel.  It is slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand.  Gravel content is 65 to 90 percent.  Carbonates are present as coatings on the undersides of gravel.  In some pedons, this layer may be absent.
