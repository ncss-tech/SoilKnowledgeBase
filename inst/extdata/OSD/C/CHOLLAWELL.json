The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are mainly gravel, but some cobbles, stones, and boulders are present in some areas.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, or 3/4.  Textures are loamy coarse sand or sandy loam.  The A horizon contains 5 to 35 percent gravel.  Traces of cobbles, stones, and boulders are present in some areas.  Clay content is 4 to 12 percent. The surface 16 inches of soil averages 0.3 to 0.6 percent organic carbon.  The sand:clay ratio for this section is 7:1 to 15:1.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3; or 7.5YR 3/4.  Textures are coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Some pedons have a texture of loamy coarse sand in part of the horizon.  The fine earth fraction of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages coarse sandy loam or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  The Bt horizon contains 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.
