  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cradlebaugh soils are on smooth floodplains and alluvial terraces at elevations of 1,375 to 1,465 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from primarily granitic rocks, with admixture of gneiss, slate, andesite, basalt and volcanic ash.  Climate is cool, semiarid with mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C.  The frost free season is 90 to 105 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The water table commonly ranges from 50 to 75 cm during late winter and spring.  Some areas have been partially drained by diversion and pumping and are somewhat poorly drained."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Cradlebaugh soils are used for meadow hay and pasture.  Cultivated areas are cropped in rotation with alfalfa and grain and harvested for grain or hay.  Native vegetation is principally clover, fescues, foxtail, saltgrass and bassia.  In the more poorly drained areas the meadows consist of sedges, redtop, bluegrass, saltgrass and native clover.  In areas that are strongly alkali or strongly saline alkali, greasewood with an understory of saltgrass and foxtail is the principal vegetation."
