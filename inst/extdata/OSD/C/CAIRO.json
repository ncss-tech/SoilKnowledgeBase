  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cairo soils are on broad flood plains. Typically they are on low terraces and high flood plains. A wet phase has been recognized. Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in 51 to 99 centimeters (20 to 39 inches) of slackwater sediments and are underlain by sandy alluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 17 degrees C. (54 to 64 degrees F)., mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), frost free period ranges from 190 to 220 days, and elevation ranges from 85 to 152 meters (280 to 500 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowdre, Cooter, Darwin, and Riley soils. Bowdre and Cooter soils have sand at less than 20 and 24 inches respectively. Darwin soils typically are lower lying on the topography. Riley soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Bowdre and Riley soils are on similar low terraces as the Cairo soils. Cooter soils are both on low ridges and in old channels and bayous."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/sec) in the clayey sediments and high or very high 42.34 to 141.14 micrometers/sec) in the underlying sandy alluvium.Permeability is very slow in the clayey sediments and rapid in the underlying sandy alluvium."
