  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canebrake series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitiod rock. Canebrake soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 9 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
