  "OVERVIEW": "The Chrisman series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvial and lacustrine sediments. Chrisman soils are on nearly level alluvial fans and level basins. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The control section is typically silty clay, silty clay loam with clay ranging from 35 to 60 percent. There may be a few pebbles scattered over the surface; coarse fragments range from O to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4. It is typically silty clay but may be silty clay loam or clay. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically silty clay but may be clay or heavy silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline. The EC ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos throughout. Slickensides are common as are pressure faces."
