The control section is typically silty clay, silty clay loam with clay ranging from 35 to 60 percent. There may be a few pebbles scattered over the surface; coarse fragments range from O to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4. It is typically silty clay but may be silty clay loam or clay. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically silty clay but may be clay or heavy silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline. The EC ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos throughout. Slickensides are common as are pressure faces."

The soils formed in fine-textured alluvium and older lacustrine sediments. Elevation is 6,000 to 6,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches and occurs mainly in the winter and spring. The mean annual air temperature is 42  degrees to 45 degrees F., the mean summer air temperature is 63 degrees to 66 degrees F. The frostfree season is 80 to 110 days."
