    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In the Western part of Fresno County, California, these soils formed in material weathered from calcareous sediment of the Tulare Formation. They are usually underlain by soft sandstones and soft shales of the Panoche Formation at depths greater than 60 inches. These soils were formally mapped as Mercey in the unpublished 1967 report, Soil Survey of Western Fresno Area, California. The Cyvar soils are differentiated by a xeric moisture regime, shallow soil, and a duripan. The calcium carbonate equivalent, sodium adsorption ratio, and electrical conductivity were determined at the Hanford Soil Survey Office Laboratory. Paul Nazar's field clothes were buried in the typical pedon during his retirement celebration on December 21, 1992.\nMajor diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\n1.1 Dry color values 6 or more and moist values 4 or higher.\n2. Argillic Horizon -- 2 to 15  inches (Bt, Btk horizons)\n2.1 A horizon: 15 to 25 percent clay, Btk horizon: 27 to 35 percent clay and always having 20 percent more total clay than the above eluvial horizon.\n2.2 Argillic horizon has clay films.\n2.3 Argillic horizon is 13 inches thick in the typical pedon.\n3. Calcic horizon -- 7 to 15 inches (Btk horizon)\n4. Duripan layer -- 35 to 45 inches thick (2Bkqm, 2Bkqym horizons)\n4.1 Hard silica and calcium carbonate capping material does not slake in water or concentrated muriatic acid after continuous bathing."
