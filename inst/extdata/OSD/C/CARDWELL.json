  "OVERVIEW": "The Cardwell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in recent alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains and flood plain steps.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
