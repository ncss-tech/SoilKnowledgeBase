The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay, less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser, and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Depth to redox concentrations is 15 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.  It is gravelly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay, and has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent soft rock fragments.  The soil reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.  Common to many fine distinct or prominent redox concentrations occur in the lower part  of this horizon.   It is very cobbly silty clay, very cobbly clay or extremely cobbly silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay, and has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 20 to 50 percent cobbles, and 30 to 40 percent soft rock fragments.  The soil reaction is strongly to slightly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carpenterville soils occur in open grassland areas on metastable broad ridgetops and side slope of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from highly sheared and partially weathered metasedimentary rock types of the Otter Point Formation.  Elevation is 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

Cassiday soils are loamy-skeletal and have an ochric epipedon.  Colepoint and Fritsland soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Crutchfield soils are fine-loamy.  Grouslous soils occur on steep side slopes of forested mountains, are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock, and are loamy-skeletal.  Houstenader and Huntley soils occur in open grassland areas on broad ridgetops and side slopes of hills and mountains.  Houstenader soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Huntley soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock and well drained."
