  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuloak series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium from granitic rock sources.  Chuloak soils are on low alluvial fans.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section, 6 to 20 inches, is dry in all parts from June 1 to September 30, unless irrigated, and is moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 31.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present in the lower B or C horizons.  Up to 15 percent pebbles may occur in any horizon.  Coarse and very coarse sand particles make up 25 to 40 percent of the A and B horizons.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, or 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/1.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons are neutral or mildly alkaline as a result of soil amendments.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent to a depth of 10 inches and is less than 1 percent at 20 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 4/2, 5/2 or 7.5YR4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3 or 4/2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  It is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 6/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3 or 4/3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy coarse sand."
