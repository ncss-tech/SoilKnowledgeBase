The soil moisture control section, 6 to 20 inches, is dry in all parts from June 1 to September 30, unless irrigated, and is moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 31.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present in the lower B or C horizons.  Up to 15 percent pebbles may occur in any horizon.  Coarse and very coarse sand particles make up 25 to 40 percent of the A and B horizons.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, or 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/1.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons are neutral or mildly alkaline as a result of soil amendments.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent to a depth of 10 inches and is less than 1 percent at 20 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 4/2, 5/2 or 7.5YR4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3 or 4/2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  It is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 6/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3 or 4/3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy coarse sand."

They formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist foggy winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F.  Average July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."
