  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crowheart series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains near river channels. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are calcareous at the surface and the surface horizon is both very alkaline and saline. Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and depth to contrasting sand and gravel substratums ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Content of organic carbon in the surface horizon ranges from .3 to 1 percent and decreases irregularly with depth. Conductivity of the upper part of the solum ranges from 4 to 10 or more millimhos and decreases with depth.  Exchangeable sodium percentage is usually about 20 percent in the surface horizons but ranges from 15 to 30 percent and decreases rapidly with depth in the Bg horizon. The control section is highly stratified but has a weighted average texture of sandy loam or loam with clay ranging from 15 to 18 percent, silt from 15 to 20 percent, and sand from 40 to 70 percent with less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Content of rock fragments is typically less than 5 percent but ranges from 0 to 10 percent. These soils have fluctuating water tables during most of the period when not frozen. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F. The Az horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 through 3. It is strongly to very strongly alkaline (pH 8.8 to 10.0). Typically this horizon has a granular or crumb structure. Exchangeable sodium percentage is normally about 20 percent but ranges from 15 to 30 percent. This horizon is soft to slightly hard, the B2g horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It has many large prominent redox concentrations of contrasting color, but the base chroma of the horizon is 2 or less. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.0). It contains less than 1 to 3 millimhos conductivity and less than 5 percent exchangeable sodium."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crowheart soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and are usually near the river channel. Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in highly stratified flood plain alluvium derived principally from sedimentary rock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer months. The soils have continuous water tables which keep them moist most of the year. The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F."
