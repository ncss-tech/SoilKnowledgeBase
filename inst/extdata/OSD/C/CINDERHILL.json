These soils formed in tephra derived from volcanic rock. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches (457 to 559 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as snow December to February. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 to 7.7 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
