  "OVERVIEW": "The Cottonthomas series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that are formed in alluvium from ash.  They are on fan terraces and hillsides and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.",
