  "OVERVIEW": "The Crosswhite series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain backslopes.  Crosswhite soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium weathered from andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature about 51 degrees F.",
