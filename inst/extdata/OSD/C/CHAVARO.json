  "OVERVIEW": "The Chavaro series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Chavaro soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F).",
