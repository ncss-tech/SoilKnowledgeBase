  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cucharas series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from shale.  Cucharas soils are on mountain slopes, hills and hilltops.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
