    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonate ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent in the lower part of the B horizon or in the C horizon.  The particle size control section contains more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist.  In some pedons, the lower part has chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam and moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have dark gray silt coatings on faces of peds.\nIn the E/B horizon, the E part has colors similar to the E horizon and the B part has colors similar to Bt horizon.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Gray or light gray silt coatings are on faces of peds.  Some pedons have relic round topped columnar peds that are degraded in color and structure with horizontal and vertical streaks of gray of light gray extending an inch or more into the columns.  These peds part readily to medium through very fine subangular or angular blocks.  The E/B horizon is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have B/E, EB, or BE horizons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is silty clay, clay loam, or clay.  It contains 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The Btn horizon is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and ranges to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons have Btnz, Btnk, Btkn or By horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  It has common to many accumulations of carbonate.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons have By, Bz, or BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have few or common fine nests and striations of gypsum and other salts. The C horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have silt loam lenses below 40 inches. Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 and 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 below a depth of 60 inches that are inherent from the parent material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cresbard soils are mainly on footslopes, backslopes and toeslopes on uplands.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till, or local alluvium over glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees, and mean annual precipitation from 17 to 25 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer.  Growing season is about 110 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 24 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Cavour soils do not have E/B horizons, have columnar structure in the upper Btn horizon, and are on the similar nearby landscapes.  Barnes, Forman, Peever and Svea soils are on adjacent uplands and do not have natric horizons.  Parnell and Tonka are in nearby upland depressions and do not have a natric horizon."
