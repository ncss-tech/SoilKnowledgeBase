  "REVDATE": "04/2018",
  "STATES": "CO,NM,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Curecanti series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan-remnant sideslopes, landslides and stream terraces. Slopes are from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is 6 degrees C.",
