  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 70 inches. Depth to rock is more than 6 feet. Mica flakes range from none to common in the solum. Chenneby soils do not have iron depletions in shades of gray immediately below the A horizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately acid in the A horizon, except where limed, and from extremely acid through moderately acid in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Thickness of A horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 is 6 inches or less. Iron accumulations in shades of brown range from none to common. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of brown and gray range from common to many. Texture is silt loam, or silty clay loam\nThe Bw2, or Bg horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6, or it is mottled in shades of these colors. Iron depletions of chroma 2 or less are within 24 inches of the surface. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of brown and gray range from common to many. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or rarely loam or clay loam. Some pedons have a transitional BC horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bw2 horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and olive range from none to many. Texture ranges from silty clay loam to sandy loam.\n2C or 2Cg (where present) Shades of brown, yellow, or gray. Texture is sandy loam, loam, silt loam (with greater than 15% fine sand and coarser) or is stratified sand, silt, and sometimes gravel below a depth of 60 inches"

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in the same family. Competing series in other families include the Chewacla, Kirkville, Lobelville, Mooreville, Oaklimeter, and Sardis series. Chewacla, Kirkville, Lobelville, and Mooreville soils have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Oaklimeter soils have less than 18 percent clay. Sardis soils have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chenneby soils are on flood plains and depressions. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. Chenneby soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding of very brief duration or ponding. During periods of high rainfall the water table is 1.0 foot to 2.5 feet from the surface. The soil formed in silty alluvium 3 to 6 feet thick. Near the type location, average annual rainfall is 52 inches and the average annual air temperature is 63 degrees F."

Arkabutla, Lee, Mathison, and Urbo soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less between the A1 or Ap and a depth of 20 inches. Arkabutla soils have iron depletions in shades of gray immediately below the Ap. Choccolocco, Leadvale, McQueen, and Sylacauga soils have Bt2 horizons. Shellbluff soils are well drained to moderately well drained. Cascilla soils are well drained."
