    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Camptank soils are on escarpments of plateaus. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as welded tuff or basalt. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,650 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Felcher soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and are on escarpments. Reallis soils are coarse-loamy, very deep, have cambic horizons and horizons with durinodes, and are on lake terraces."
