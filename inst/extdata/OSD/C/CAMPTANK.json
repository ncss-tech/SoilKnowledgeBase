  "OVERVIEW": "The Camptank series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Camptank soils are on escarpments of plateaus. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
