  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Cruso soils are mapped in complex with Cullasaja and Tuckasegee soils. Cullasaja and Tuckasegee soils are loamy-skeletal.  However, because Cruso is developed closer to stream channels it is sandy-skeletal and usually has greater number of  and larger surface fragments. Seeps and springs are common. Most areas of Cruso soils are too small to delineate as a consociation map unit.  These areas represent unique habitat for certain aquatic species.\nAlthough Cruso soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\n2016 Update was to change the status to Established.\nDiagnostic horizons:\nHumic Epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A horizon)\nCambic Horizon - 7 to 15 inches (Bg horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedon     S03NC-087-001.\nMLRA = 130B\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
