  "OVERVIEW": "The Chanta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel.  They are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 13 inches.",

It typically is loam and less commonly silt loam or clay loam and ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam with a clay content averaging between 20 and 30 percent.  Layers of sandy loam less than 5 inches thick are allowed in the lower part.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The lower part is calcareous in some pedons.   The content of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 20 percent.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is sand or coarse sand containing 15 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Layers of very gravelly loam less than 5 inches thick are allowed in some part.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon up to 5 inches thick above the 2Bk horizon.  It has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2.

The frost-free period ranges from 110 to 130 days.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  More than two-thirds of the moisture falls in the spring and summer.  The elevation ranges from 2000 to 3500 feet."

They do not have sand and gravel 2C horizons.  Havre soils are on stream flood plains.  They do not have a mollic epipedon.  Marmarth and Rhame soils are on nearby uplands.  Marmarth soils have an argillic horizon.  Rhame soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tinsley are on edges of steep terraces and hills.  They have sand and gravel at depths of less than 14 inches."
