  "STATES": "NY,OH,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caneadea series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, nearly level to strongly sloping soils on slackwater terraces of lake plains and valley floors of depressional landscapes. They formed in clayey Wisconsin age glaciolacustrine sediments. Permeability is very slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Stratification is usually evident within the series control section. The soils are typically free of rock fragments, but some pedons contain a few pebbles.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have A horizons 3 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nAn E or BE horizon with redoximorphic features is present in some pedons. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6; chroma of 0 to 2 is restricted to the lower part. Texture commonly is silty clay or clay, and less commonly silty clay loam. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, or medium to very coarse prismatic, or very thin to thick platy. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky or prismatic, or very thin to thick platy.

Brockport and Lockport soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches. Churchville soils have a lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Odessa soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Remsen soils formed in till and have a higher sand and rock fragment content in individual layers.

Caneadea soils are in a toposequence with the poorly drained Canadice soils and the very poorly drained Lorain soils. These soils typically occupy lower landscape positions and depressions. The moderately well drained Ellsworth and Geeburg soils and the somewhat poorly drained Mahoning and Remsen soils are on adjacent till plains. The moderately well drained Glenford soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils and the poorly drained Sebring soils are medium textured soils associated soils on similar landscape positions."
