  "OVERVIEW": "The Caneadea series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, nearly level to strongly sloping soils on slackwater terraces of lake plains and valley floors of depressional landscapes. They formed in clayey Wisconsin age glaciolacustrine sediments. Permeability is very slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 914 millimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",

Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6; chroma of 0 to 2 is restricted to the lower part. Texture commonly is silty clay or clay, and less commonly silty clay loam. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, or medium to very coarse prismatic, or very thin to thick platy.

These soils typically occupy lower landscape positions and depressions. The moderately well drained Ellsworth and Geeburg soils and the somewhat poorly drained Mahoning and Remsen soils are on adjacent till plains.
