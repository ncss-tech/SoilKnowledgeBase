  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay, but typically is 42 to 60 percent. Stratification is usually evident within the series control section. The soils are typically free of rock fragments, but some pedons contain a few pebbles.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have A horizons 3 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nAn E or BE horizon with redoximorphic features is present in some pedons. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6; chroma of 0 to 2 is restricted to the lower part. Texture commonly is silty clay or clay, and less commonly silty clay loam. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, or medium to very coarse prismatic, or very thin to thick platy. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky or prismatic, or very thin to thick platy. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Some pedons are stratified with thin layers of silt loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brockport, Churchville, Lockport, Odessa, Remsen, and Rhinebeck series are in the same family. Brockport and Lockport soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches. Churchville soils have a lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Odessa soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Remsen soils formed in till and have a higher sand and rock fragment content in individual layers. Rhinebeck soils have sola less than 40 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Caneadea soils are on plane or convex slopes on lake plains. The soils formed in calcareous, Wisconsin age, glaciolacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are from 570 to 1,300 feet msl. The mean annual precipitation is 29 to 43 inches. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost free period is 110 to 198 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canadice, Ellsworth, Fitchville, Geeburg, Glenford, Lorain, Mahoning, Remsen and Sebring soils. Caneadea soils are in a toposequence with the poorly drained Canadice soils and the very poorly drained Lorain soils. These soils typically occupy lower landscape positions and depressions. The moderately well drained Ellsworth and Geeburg soils and the somewhat poorly drained Mahoning and Remsen soils are on adjacent till plains. The moderately well drained Glenford soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils and the poorly drained Sebring soils are medium textured soils associated soils on similar landscape positions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 10 inches (Ap and BE horizon).\nAquic conditions - begin at a depth of 7 inches.\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 36 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\nNew surface runoff class names are used and are not comparable or the same definitions as the old names.\nIt is anticipated that soils correlated as Caneadea in MLRA's other than MLRA 139, and on slopes greater than 15 percent, will be correlated as other series in future MLRA updates.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for the following profiles: PG-1 (the typical pedon), AB-49, AB-90, AB-94 and GA-S14. Samples analyzed by Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
