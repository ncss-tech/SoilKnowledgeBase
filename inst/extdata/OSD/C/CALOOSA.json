    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the fill material ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  Fragments of shell range from sand-size up to 6 cm in size.  Shell content ranges from less than 5 percent to 30 percent, by volume, throughout, but the weighted average of shell content (2 mm or larger) in the control section is less than 10 percent, by volume.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is stratified in these colors.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of yellow or brown range from none to many.  Underlying materials are generally sandy, but some pedons have silty clay loam, clay, or sandy clay Ab and Cb horizons at depths of more than 40 inches.  Texture is sandy clay, clay, or silty clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caloosa soils are on broad to narrow flats bordering major rivers in Peninsular Florida where materials dredged from the river bottoms has been spread.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent.  They consist of deposits of stratified clayey materials capped by varying thicknesses of more recently dredged sandy materials.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches and the average annual soil temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Matlacha, St. Augustine, and Wulfert series.  Matlacha and St. Augustine soils are on similar positions, are somewhat poorly drained, and are composed of sandy dredge and fill materials that contain fragments of diagnostic horizons.  In addition, Matlacha soils have more than 15 percent, by volume, shell and limestone fragments.  The very poorly drained Wulfert soils are in lower adjacent tidal swamps and marshes and are organic."
