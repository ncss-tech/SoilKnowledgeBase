(C1 and part of C2 horizons)\nSeries control section: 0 to 152 cm.\nA cambic horizon is not recognized in this soil because there is no change in color nor clear evidence of removal of carbonates. The variable effervescence is assumed to be related to deposition of the parent material.\nCatdraw soils are in a mesic soil temperature regime with an ustic soil moisture class bordering on aridic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
