  "OVERVIEW": "The Catdraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Catdraw soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",

The variable effervescence is assumed to be related to deposition of the parent material.\nCatdraw soils are in a mesic soil temperature regime with an ustic soil moisture class bordering on aridic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
