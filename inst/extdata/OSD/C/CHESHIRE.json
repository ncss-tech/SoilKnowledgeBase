  "BYREV": "Rev. MFF-SMF",
  "REVDATE": "04/2010",
  "STATES": "CT,MA,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheshire series consists of very deep, well drained loamy soils formed in supraglacial till on uplands. They are nearly level through very steep soils on till plains and hills. Slope ranges from 0 through 60 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high throughout. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 38 inches. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout the soil. Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, reaction ranges from is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry value is 6 or more. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. The Ap or A horizon is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The Bw horizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Pockets or thin lenses of loamy sand are in some pedons. The horizon is massive or it has weak platy structure. Consistence is commonly very friable or friable, but the range includes firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in the same family.\nThe Ashe, Brookfield, Buladean, Cardigan, Chadakoin, Charlton, Chatfield, Chestnut, Ditney, Dutchess, Edneyville, Fedscreek, Hazel, Lordstown, Marrowbone, Maymead, Newport, Riverhead, Soco, St. Albans, Stecoah, Steinsburg, Stinger, Tipshaw, Valois, and Yalesville soils are in closely related families. Ashe, Cardigan, Chatfield, Ditney, Hazel, Lordstown, Marrowbone, Steinsburg, and Yalesville soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Brookfield soils have many mica flakes, are dominated by micaceous schist rock fragments, and have 7.5YR or yellower hue in the C horizon. Charlton, Dutchess, Fedscreek, Maymead, St. Albans, and Valois soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B and C horizons. Chestnut soils formed in residuum and have weathered bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Edneyville soils formed in residuum and have a C horizon of saprolite. Riverhead soils have a stratified sand and gravel substratum within a 20 to 40 inch depth. Satsop soils receive 60 to 80 inches of precipitation annually."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cheshire soils are nearly level through very steep and are on till plains and upland hills. Slope ranges from 0 through 60 percent. The soils formed in acid glacial till derived mostly from reddish sandstone, shale, and conglomerate with some basalt. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 through 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 130 through 185 days."

The moderately well drained Watchaug soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Berlin soils are on lacustrine terraces. Branford, Ellington, Hartford, Manchester, and Penwood soils are on nearby outwash terraces and are underlain by stratified sand and gravel. Broadbrook, Ludlow, and Wethersfield soils have a dense substratum. Holyoke soils have bedrock within a 10 to 20 inch depth. Menlo and Wilbraham soils are very poorly drained and poorly drained, respectively. Wapping soils are moderately well drained and have 7.5YR or yellower hue in the B horizon."
