  "OVERVIEW": "The Christianburg series consists of very deep, well or moderately well drained  soils formed in alluvium. Christianburg soils are on alluvial flats, fan skirts, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
