    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 80 to 110 consecutive days or more in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to highly fractured bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section average 35 to 70 percent of which 35 to 50 percent are gravel and 0 to 20 percent are cobbles and stones.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It has a base saturation by ammonium acetate of 75 to 95 percent.\nIn some pedons, there is a C horizon with colors similar to the Bw horizon and extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly loam textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Caris series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  Elevations are 1,000 to 4,750 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  In California, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 160 days.  Slopes range from 50 to 90 percent."
