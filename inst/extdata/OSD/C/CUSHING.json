  "OVERVIEW": "The Cushing series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous till on ground moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying till.  Slopes range from 20 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 throughout. Reaction in the soil ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Low value and chroma are typical of the A horizon. The Ap or A horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Severely eroded phases are sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 7 or more.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nCushing soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  These horizons have tongues of E material surrounding thin, columnlike upward extensions of Bt material or wholly surrounding small isolated remnants of Bt horizon.  The E part is like the E horizon and the Bt part is like the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 5.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have BC horizons with color and texture similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons are similar in color and texture to the overlaying Bt horizons.  They are effervescent and  have masses of calcium carbonates apparent.\nThe BC horizon typically has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y,  value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Less commonly, it has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have distinct or prominent high and low chroma mottles at depths between 30 and 85 inches."
