  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches; it is thinnest in microknolls and thickest in microdepressions.  Distance between the centers of the microknolls and the centers of the microdepressions ranges from 5 to 12 feet.  Gilgai microrelief consists of microknolls 1 to 10 inches higher than the microdepressions.  Intersecting slickensides occur within 40 inches and commonly begin at about 22 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of less than 1.5.  Texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam and the content of clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam and the content of clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Vertically oriented filled cracks range from 1/2 inch to 4 inches in width, and are gray or very dark gray clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is brownish or reddish clay with or without grayish clay layers.  Content of clay ranges from 40 to 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clarita soils are on very gently sloping to strongly sloping side slopes within the landscape of uplands in the Grand Prairie.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  The upper part of the soil formed in clays of Cretaceous age and the underlying part formed in clays of Permian age.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Gilgai microrelief consisting of microknolls 1 to 10 inches higher than the microdepressions is present in some area. On aerial photography the microknolls appear as light streaks and the microdepressions appear as dark streaks extending from the top to bottom of slopes, thus giving a striped effect. Cultivation has leveled the gilgai microrelief in most areas.\nMean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Burleson series and Heiden  Durant, Grainola, and Shidler series.  Burleson soils occur on broad ridgetops or flats. Heiden soils occur on similar landscapes.  Durant soils have argillic horizons and occur on broad ridgetops or flats. Grainola soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and lack A horizons with moist chroma of 1 and usually occur on similar landscapes.  Shidler soils have sola less than 20 inches thick over hard limestone bedrock and occur on ridges."
