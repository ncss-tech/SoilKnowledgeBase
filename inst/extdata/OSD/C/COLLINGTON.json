This revision restricts the range of glauconite pellet content to a weighted average of 10 to 20 percent, by volume within the mineralogy control section, and maintains the series in a mixed mineralogy family. It also changes the classification from Humic Hapludults to Typic Hapludults based on more current field observations throughout the MLRA area in which the soil is found. It also revises colors, textures, geographic setting, parent materials, and other RIC and properties of the soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nDatabase Information:\nOSD Data Mapunit ID: To be developed\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID: 407359\nOSD User Pedon ID: To be developed\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas  Precip   Elevation\nNJ0023 COLLINGTON  0-80   50-57   180-215    42-48    25-165\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNJ0023 NONE          6.0-6.0             -     >72     ---\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNJ0023  0-13  SL SIL FSL              0-  0  95-100 10-20    -\nNJ0023  0-13  LS                      0-  0  95-100  5-10    -\nNJ0023 13-32  SCL SL CL               0-  0  95-100 15-35    -\nNJ0023 32-60  SR S SL                 0-  0  95-100  5-15    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
