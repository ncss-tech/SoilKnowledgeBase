Gallen and Tombstone soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. In addition, Gallen soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys and are more moist in May and June. Gilland soils are moderately deep. Polar soils are in the Central Rolling Red Plains and are more moist in May and June.  Powerline soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on piedmont slopes, fan remnants, and alluvial fans below igneous hills and mountains.  Slopes along ridges range from 1 to 10 percent, and on side slopes from 5 to about 50 percent.  The soils formed in loamy gravelly sediments from succeeding erosional sediments that built up these piedmont slopes.  At the type location, the rounded gravel is of several kinds of igneous rock.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 8 to 16 inches with most occurring during the late summer and early fall months.   Frost- free period ranges from 210 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,500 feet."

Chamberino soils have high organic carbon relative to the sand/clay ratio, but are not in areas that border the ustic moisture regime. Holguin soils are very shallow and shallow over conglomerate rock.  Lajitas soils are less than 20 inches thick over igneous bedrock and are on hillsides. Paisano soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  Monterosa soils are less than 20 inches to a petrocalcic horizon and are on plane and weakly convex ridges."
