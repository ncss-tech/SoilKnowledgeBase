  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes along ridges range from 1 to 10 percent, and on side slopes from 5 to about 50 percent.  The soils formed in loamy gravelly sediments from succeeding erosional sediments that built up these piedmont slopes.  At the type location, the rounded gravel is of several kinds of igneous rock.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 8 to 16 inches with most occurring during the late summer and early fall months.   Frost- free period ranges from 210 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,500 feet."

Holguin soils are very shallow and shallow over conglomerate rock.  Lajitas soils are less than 20 inches thick over igneous bedrock and are on hillsides. Paisano soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  Monterosa soils are less than 20 inches to a petrocalcic horizon and are on plane and weakly convex ridges."
