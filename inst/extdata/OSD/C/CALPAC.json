The soil is moist in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 40 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches. The soil moisture regime is typic Xeric.\nThe mollic epipedon is 21 to 34 inches thick. The depth to the calcic horizon is 23 to 43 inches.  Content of pebbles, cobbles and flagstones is 35 to 80 percent throughout the profile. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Clay content in the particle-size control section is 18 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR dry, 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4 dry and moist.  It is extremely stony loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely flaggy loam, extremely gravelly silt loam, or extremely cobbly silt loam,  with 60 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 22 percent."

Slope gradients are 30 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone, quartzite, and sandstone. The climate is moist subhumid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."
