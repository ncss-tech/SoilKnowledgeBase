  "OVERVIEW": "The Calpac series consists of deep and very deep well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone, quartzite and sandstone.  Calpac soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soil moisture regime is typic Xeric.\nThe mollic epipedon is 21 to 34 inches thick. The depth to the calcic horizon is 23 to 43 inches.  Content of pebbles, cobbles and flagstones is 35 to 80 percent throughout the profile. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Clay content in the particle-size control section is 18 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR dry, 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4 dry and moist.  It is extremely stony loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely flaggy loam, extremely gravelly silt loam, or extremely cobbly silt loam,  with 60 to 80 percent rock fragments.
