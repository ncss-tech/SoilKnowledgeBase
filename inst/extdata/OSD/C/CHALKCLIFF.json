  "OVERVIEW": "The Chalkcliff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone. Chalkcliff soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
