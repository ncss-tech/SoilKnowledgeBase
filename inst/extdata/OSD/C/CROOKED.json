The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 25 to 38nches.  Depth to a water table is 1.5 to 3.0 feet and is present from March through April.  Sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content in the solum is 15 to 30 percent. The solum has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  SAR is 5 to 13.\nThe Bn horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  SAR is 13 to 30.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons, when present, has value of 5 through 7 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.

These soils formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Boyce soils are poorly drained, fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on floodplains.  Stearns soils are poorly drained, fine-loamy, and calcareous soils in depressions on low terraces.  Powder soils are well drained, coarse-silty soils and are on floodplains adjacent to streams.  Metolius soils do not have a high pH and are located on low terraces.  Era soils are somewhat excessively drained soils and are on adjacent high terraces."
