  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crooked series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Crooked soils are in depressions or low positions on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Depth to a water table is 1.5 to 3.0 feet and is present from March through April.  Sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content in the solum is 15 to 30 percent. The solum has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

Boyce soils are poorly drained, fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on floodplains.  Stearns soils are poorly drained, fine-loamy, and calcareous soils in depressions on low terraces.  Powder soils are well drained, coarse-silty soils and are on floodplains adjacent to streams.  Metolius soils do not have a high pH and are located on low terraces.  Era soils are somewhat excessively drained soils and are on adjacent high terraces."
