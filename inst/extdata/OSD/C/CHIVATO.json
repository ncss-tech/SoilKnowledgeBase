  "OVERVIEW": "The Chivato series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in lacustrine materials derived from basalt. Chivato soils are in playas on lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
