Chivato soils are in depressions and playas on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 8,100 to 8,600 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days."

The Apark soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and lack vertic properties. The Canoneros soils are shallow to a lithic contact with basalt. The Seco soils have an argillic horizon and do not crack to the surface."
