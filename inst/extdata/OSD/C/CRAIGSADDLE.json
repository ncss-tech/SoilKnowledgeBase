  "OVERVIEW": "The Craigsaddle series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from trondhjemite.  Craigsaddle soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on granitic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches, (1219 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, (14 degrees C).",
