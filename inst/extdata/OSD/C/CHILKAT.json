  "OVERVIEW": "Typically, these soils have a thin, gray A2 horizon, a reddish brown B horizon about 12 inches thick, and an olive gray Cx horizon that is hard and brittle when dry. They are developed in gravelly and very gravelly sandy loam glacial drift and colluvium.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The texture of A2 horizon ranges from silt loam to gravelly sandy loam. Rounded or subangular gravel makes up about 40 to 60 percent of the soil mass, and generally increases with depth.  Stones and large boulders commonly occur on or near the surface and the stoniness class ranges from 1 to 2. The solum ranges from 12 to 18 inches thick.\nThe color of the B2 horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  Color values range from 3 to 5 and chromas from 3 to 5. The lower part of the B horizon, below a depth of 10 to 12 inches, is commonly weakly cemented and hard when dry.\nThe substratum is compact, brittle, and hard to very hard when dry.  Large faint olive brown mottles and a few streaks of iron stained material may occur in the substratum."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the in the same subgroup and the Talkeetna and Deshu series. The Karta soils are finer and have a thicker solum. The Talkeetna soils have smeary dark spodic horizons and the solum is not as gravelly. The Deshu soils have fine, mottled subsoils.  Setting: The Chilkat soils commonly occupy rolling to moderately steep glacial moraines. Slopes are generally short and gradients are usually between 12 and 30 percent but range from O to 45 percent. The regolith is gravelly sandy loam glacial drift."

The Kenai soils are developed in silty materials over glacial till and lack a fragipan. The Lutak soils are poorly drained, are developed in sandy materials, and have an ortstein horizon. The Tolstoi soils are shallow over bedrock and have no fragipan."
