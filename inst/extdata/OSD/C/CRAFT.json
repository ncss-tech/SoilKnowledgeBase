  "OVERVIEW": "The Craft series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium on floodplains.  They have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F at the type location.",
