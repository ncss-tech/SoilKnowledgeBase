The soils formed in mixed decomposing semi-consolidated gravel,  sand and silt dominantly of basic igneous origin.  The climate is warm and dry in summer, cold and moist in winter.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."
