  "OVERVIEW": "The Cranecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed semiconsolidated decomposing alluvial deposits.  Cranecreek soils are on old terraces and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
