  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for more than 60 consecutive days.  These soils are calcareous in all parts.  The soil is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  The particle-size control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is massive or has weak medium prismatic structure.  Redox features are few or common distinct and have a chroma of 2 or less where the matrix has a chroma of 3.\nThe C2 and C3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 6, 7 or 8 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  These horizons range from fine sandy loam to coarse sand.  They are massive or single grained.  Redox features are few or common distinct."

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees to 48 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches; and the frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."
