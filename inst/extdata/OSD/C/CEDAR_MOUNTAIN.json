  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedar Mountain series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks over residuum from shale. These soils are on rolling shale hills and scarps with slopes of 3 to 45 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.and mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",

Classification changed in 9/94.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample numbers U611738 through U611740, Utah State University soil testing lab (dated 1967); source: Carbon-Emery soil survey area, Utah, SCS, 1970.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
