  "OVERVIEW": "The Clapper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. Clapper soils are on fan remnants, hillslopes, and mesas. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
