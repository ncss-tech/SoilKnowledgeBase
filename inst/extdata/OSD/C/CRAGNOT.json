  "OVERVIEW": "The Cragnot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium, and alluvium derived from limestone.  Cragnot soils are on hills and valleys.  Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 to 45 degrees F.",
