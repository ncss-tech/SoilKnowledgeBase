  "REVDATE": "09/2002",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chalkville series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils. They formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from tuffaceous bedrock on ridges and pediments. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees and the mean summer temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The sand and coarse silt is 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass in the C horizon..\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. Apparent matrix texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Texture is somewhat difficult to obtain because of the glass content. Coarse fragments range from 20 to 80 percent and are mainly angular tuffaceous gravel. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."
