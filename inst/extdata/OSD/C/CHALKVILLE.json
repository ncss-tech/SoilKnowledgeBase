  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock and lithic contact ranges from 9 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees and the mean summer temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The sand and coarse silt is 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass in the C horizon..\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. Apparent matrix texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Texture is somewhat difficult to obtain because of the glass content. Coarse fragments range from 20 to 80 percent and are mainly angular tuffaceous gravel. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chalkhill, Joebas, and the Seedskadee series. Chalkhill soils do not contain ash, volcanic glass, or tuffaceous coarse fragments in the control section. Jeobas soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon. Seedskadee soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 percent or more of the time the soil temperture is above 5 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 6,600 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, of which about half falls as snow and rain in April, May and early June. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 85 to 110 days."
