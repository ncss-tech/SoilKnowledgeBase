  "OVERVIEW": "The Colomex series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and igneous rock.  Colomex soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
