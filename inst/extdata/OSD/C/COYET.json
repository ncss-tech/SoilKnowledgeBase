  "OVERVIEW": "The Coyet series consists of very deep or deep, excessively drained soils formed in aeolian deposits, alluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone.  Coyet soils are on hillslopes, breaks, alluvial fans, and plateaus.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days immediately following April 1 and dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days immediately following July 1.  Depth to lime carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  A paralithic contact is at a depth of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  In some pedons the Bk horizons are absent and C horizons are present.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bk2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The C horizons, when present, have colors, textures, and reaction which are the same as the Bk horizons."

Maybell, Zeomont, and Zeona soils are noncalcareous to depths of 40 or more inches.  Yetull soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for some period immediately after July 1."
