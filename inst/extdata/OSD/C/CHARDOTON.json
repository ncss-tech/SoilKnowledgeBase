  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chardoton soils are lava flow troughs on shield volcanoes and lava plains.  Elevations range from 2,850 to 3,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  Average annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
