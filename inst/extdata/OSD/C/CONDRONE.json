  "OVERVIEW": "The Condrone series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium from mixed igneous sources.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on inset fans of the fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
