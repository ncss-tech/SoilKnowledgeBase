  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard limestone bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 4 to 14 inches thick. The soil is typically effervescent to the surface but may be leached a few inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry for 35 to 45 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  The soil matrix in the particle size control section is typically loam but may be clay loam.  Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent and there is greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and are limestone gravel, channers, and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, the texture is channery loam but may be loam, gravelly loam, or cobbly loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is typically channery loam but may be loam or clay loam with or without the channery, cobbly, or gravelly modifier.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate as soft masses, seams, and coatings on rock fragments. .  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges form 8 to 14 percent."

Ansari soils have hue of 7.5YR through 10R.  Falcon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section and are noncalcareous throughout.  Namur soils are not dry in the moisture control section for 35 to 45 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Potagannissing soils are somewhat poorly drained."

They formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum influenced by the underlying limestone.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
