    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acquango, Aldo, Bigapple, Biltmore, Boplain, Breeze, Caesar, Dabney, Hodge, Oakville, Osolo, Pahuk, Penwood, Perks, Pinegrove, Plainfield, Poquonock, Ronda, Samoa, Sardak, Sarpy, Scotah, Spessard, Suncook, Tyner, Wapanucket, and Windsor series.  Acquango soils have salinity throughout the soil profile.  Aldo and Scotah soils are saturated with water at depths of 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches).  Bigapple, Breeze, and Poquonock soils have anthrotransported material in the upper part of the series control section. Biltmore, Caesar, Dabney, Oakville, Osolo, Penwood, Pahuk, Plainfield, Perks, Pinegrove, Samoa, Spessard, Suncook, Tyner, and Windsor soils are more acid than neutral in some part of the soil profile and do not have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Boplain soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Hodge, Sarpy and Sardak soils have stratification in the soil profile and formed in alluvium on flood plains.  In addition, Hodge soils average more than 10 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section and Sarpy soils have more medium and coarse sand in the soil profile. Ronda soils have a mean soil temperature of 13.9 degrees C (57 degrees F) and mean precipitation of 1219 mm (48 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chute soils are on steep slopes along the face of bluffs, on knobs on top of bluffs, or on dunes or hills behind the bluffs along the valleys of rivers and large streams, or on high stream terraces near large stream valleys.  They formed in oxidized and unleached eolian sand.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from about 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost free period ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 396 meters (400 to 1300 feet) above mean sea level."

Hamburg soils are on similar knobs on top of the bluffs or on steep hills along the side of the river valleys.  Bold, Hamburg, Seaton, and Timula soils all have lower content of sand and higher content of silt in the control section and are on nearby upland landforms."
