  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically the solum is 20 to 30 inches thick, but may range to 40 inches thick.  Depth to hard limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  Silt content is less than 15 percent.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Lenses or streaks of sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam are in many pedons.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nWhere present, the 2C horizon is composed of soft limestone.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  It is dominated by clay and silt-size carbonates that coat the sand grains.  Fragments of limestone, or in some pedons, shell fragments, range from few to many.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard limestone bedrock."

They formed in regolith composed of sandy and loamy marine sediments over limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

Delray soils are on similar positions, are very deep, and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  Felda and Floridana soils are on similar positions, are very deep, and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  In addition, Felda soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Immokalee, Myakka, and Wabasso soils are very deep, on similar positions, and are Spodosols.  Manatee soils are on similar positions and have coarse-loamy subsoils.  The somewhat poorly drained Matmon soils are on adjacent higher positions, have clayey, smectitic subsoils, are shallow to limestone bedrock, and do not have mollic epipedons.  The poorly drained Parkwood soils are on slightly higher positions, are very deep, have less clay in the subsoil, and lack mollic epipedons."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Copeland soils remain in native vegetation and are used for wildlife habitat.  A few areas are cleared and used for truck crops such as cabbage, cucumbers, lima beans, peppers, tomatoes, and watermelons.  The vegetation consists of cabbage palmettos, maples, cypress, gums with an undergrowth of vines, pineland threeawn, shrubs, and ferns.  Blue flags, rushes, sedges, and lilies are common in depressions."
