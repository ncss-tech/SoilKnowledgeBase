  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 25 to 50 inches.  In some pedons the solum is terminated by bedrock, but in others, there is an intervening C horizon.  Bedrock is below a depth of 40 inches.  Thickness of silty mantle over the shale residuum is 15 to 30 inches.  The solum is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and the substratum is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Pedons formed partly in local alluvium derived from shale and those with a thin sandy horizon (less than 6 inches thick) just above the bedrock are within the range of the series.  Calamine pedons typically do not have coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is N 2/0.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, but the range includes loam.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Btg1 horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value is 4 through 6.  Depending upon presence or absence of distinct or prominent mottles, chroma is 2 or less with 10YR and 2.5Y hue, and 3 or less with 5Y hue.  Clay films are continuous or patchy on faces of peds.  The Btg1 horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Btg2 and 2Btg3 horizons are silty clay loam (greater than 35 percent clay), silty clay, or clay.  The finer textured part ranges from 1/3 to 2/3 of the total B horizon thickness.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 or less.  Mottle colors are similar to those of the B horizon.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe Cr horizon has 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 through 6.  In some pedons the shale is coherent enough to be designated an R horizon."

Conser, Kokomo, Konert, Lippincott, Pewamo, and Rowe soils do not have sola terminated by bedrock; in addition, they contain less clay and more sand in the lower B and C horizons.  Millsdale soils have a lithic contact at depths less than 40 inches.  Ashkum, Bono, Montgomery, and Peotone soils do not have argillic horizons.  In addition, Ashkum and Peotone soils have 2C horizons formed in glacial drift.  Hoytville and Lorain soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Ragsdale soils are fine-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calamine soils typically are on broad nearly level areas, in slightly depressed areas and swales, on foot slopes, where seepage occurs, and in nearly level basins of old flood plains.  Slopes are typically 0 to 3 percent, but on foot slopes, where seepage occurs, slopes range to 12 percent.  They formed in 15 to 30 inches of loess, or other silty deposits, and in the underlying residuum weathered from calcareous shale of Ordovician age.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges between 25 and 35 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashdale, Derinda, Dodgeville, Keltner, Schapville, and Shullsburg soils.  The Ashdale and Dodgeville soils, which are nearby, are better drained and underlain by dolomite.  Derinda and Keltner soils are better drained, have browner or less gray colors in the B horizons, and are underlain by residuum weathered from shale.  In addition, Derinda soils have E horizons.  The moderately well drained Schapville soils and the somewhat poorly drained Shullsburg soils are in a drainage sequence with the Calamine soils and are the most common associates."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the soil remains in grassland.  Some of the soil has been drained and is used for cropland, but adequate drainage is difficult to maintain and only fair crop yields are obtained. Native vegetation is marsh grasses, sedges, and water-tolerant plants. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa."
