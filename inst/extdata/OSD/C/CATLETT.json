  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragment content of gray, yellow and brown hornfel and granulite range from about 5 to 65 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 75 in the B and C horizon.  It is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 8.  The low chroma is inherent from parent rock. The texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 7.  The low chroma is inherent from parent rock.  The texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is partially weathered granulite that can be dug with hand tools.\nThe R is hard hornfel and granulite."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catlett soils are on rolling ridges and short sideslopes in the more dissected landforms of the Culpeper basin. These soils formed in residuum from Triassic and Jurassic gray brown and yellow hornfel and granulite of the Culpeper basin of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 44 inches."
