  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Catlett series are shallow and well drained.  They formed in weathered products of dark gray to brown Jurassic and Triassic hornfel and granulite.  These soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes in the Culpeper Basin of the Northern part of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",

Rock fragment content of gray, yellow and brown hornfel and granulite range from about 5 to 65 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 75 in the B and C horizon.  It is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 8.  The low chroma is inherent from parent rock. The texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 7.  The low chroma is inherent from parent rock.  The texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is partially weathered granulite that can be dug with hand tools.\nThe R is hard hornfel and granulite."
