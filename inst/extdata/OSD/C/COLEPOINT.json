The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 30 percent rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The A1 horizon is loam with 15 to 20 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The A2 and A3 horizons are gravelly loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Colepoint soils are on stable to metastable broad ridgetops, benches, and side slopes of forested mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevation is 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
