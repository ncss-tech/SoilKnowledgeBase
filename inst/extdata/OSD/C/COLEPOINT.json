  "OVERVIEW": "The Colepoint series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Colepoint soils are on broad ridgetops, benches, and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
