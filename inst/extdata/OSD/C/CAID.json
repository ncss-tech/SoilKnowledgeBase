Small areas are irrigated to such crops as cotton, corn, grain sorghum, small grain, truck crops, and introduced grasses.  The original plant community was open grassland dominated by mid-grasses with occasional mesquite trees and woody shrubs.  Bundleflower, bushsunflower, and orange zexmania are important forbs.  In early stages of retrogression, such plants as pink pappusgrass and plains bristlegrass increase but decrease with further deterioration.  Other plants which increase or invade are hooded windmillgrass, Hall panicum, curlymesquite, threeawn, red grama, mesquite, whitebrush, blackbrush, condalia, wolfberry, spiny hackberry, guayacan, guajillo, twisted acacia, Texas persimmon, and pricklypear cactus.
