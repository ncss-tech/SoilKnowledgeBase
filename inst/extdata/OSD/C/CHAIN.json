  "OVERVIEW": "The Chain series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale with an overburden derived from andesite and breccia.  Chain soils are on the tops and hill slopes of mesas and ridges.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
