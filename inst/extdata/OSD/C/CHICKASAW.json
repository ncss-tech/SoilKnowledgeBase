  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the Cr horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.  The discontinuity contains significantly more clay and less sand than the overlying horizons, but this is not a requirement for the series.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  The Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to.10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt and Btss horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  They are clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe B/C horizon or C horizon, have colors and textures similar to the Bt and Cr horizons.  Some pedons have a few low chroma mottles in these horizons that are derived from the parent material.  Some pedons may have claystone channers sufficiently dense to constitute coarse fragments.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is horizontally bedded , highly fractured siltstone or claystone.  In some pedons, it is interbedded with thin lenses of weakly cemented sandstone.  Fractures are both vertical and horizontal."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colbert, Eastwood, Etoile, Kipling, Lorman, Oula, Rayburn, Wilcox, and Woodtell in the same family. Colbert, Lorman, Rayburn, Eastwood, and Woodtell series are moderately well drained. In addition the Colbert series formed in limestone bedrock. The Etoile series formed in clayey marls.  Wilcox, Kipling, and Etoile are somewhat poorly drained.  The Oula series is very deep and formed in grayish acidic clays."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on sloping to steep upland ridgetops, sideslopes and footslopes.  They formed in deposits consisting of horizontally bedded, weakly cemented siltstone, claystone, and sandstone.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent and are generally convex.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 5l inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dulac, Luverne, Savannah, Silerton, and Smithdale series.  Dulac and Silerton soils have a thin mantle of loess.  Also, the Dulac soils have a fragipan. Luverne soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey coastal plain deposits.  Savannah soils formed in loamy alluvium and have a fragipan. Smithdale soils formed in loamy Coastal Plain deposits."

Some are planted to shortleaf pine or loblolly pine.  A few areas are cultivated.  Most cultivated areas are severely eroded.  Native vegetation includes white oak, southern red oak, black oak, yellow-poplar, shortleaf pine, sweetgum, hickory, sugar maple, and hackberry."
