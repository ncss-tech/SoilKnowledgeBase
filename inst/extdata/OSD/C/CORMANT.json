  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 36 to 80 inches.  The texture in the 10 to 40 inch depth zone typically is fine sand, but ranges to sand.  It does not contain rock fragments and contains 0 to 25 percent medium and coarse sand in the 10 to 40 inch control particle-size section.  Some pedons have an 0 horizon as much as 4 inches thick.\nUncultivated soils have an A horizon that ranges from 4 to 10 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.  Sandy loam or fine sandy loam textures are permitted if the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  It has enough organic matter in some pedons to be identified as mucky.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has a matrix with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in part to all of the C horizon, and the part of the C horizon above depths of 20 inches has mottles in most parts.  Thin darker colored strata are in the C horizon of some pedons.  The texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Thin strata with finer textures occur below 40 inches in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have linear or slightly concave slopes typically with gradients of less than 1 percent on glacial lake plains, glacial lake plain deltas, and outwash plains.  In a few areas slopes range to 3 percent.  They formed mostly in deep sandy sediments of the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 140.  Elevation ranges from 785 to 1600 feet."

Depth to apparent water table is .5 to 2.5 feet at some time from April to June in most years for the poorly drained phase.  Depressional areas have an apparent water table as high as +1.0 to 1.0 feet at some time from January to December in most years."
