The soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer months.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent gravel.  The solum ranges from 3 to 5 feet thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has faint to prominent redox features below the upper 10 inches of the horizon.  The Bt horizon is silty clay or clay with 40 to 55 percent of clay.  It has moderate fine to coarse subangular blocky structure and is moderately or strongly acid.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to over 60 inches."

The soils formed in fine textured colluvium and glacial till dominantly from basic igneous rocks including tuffs and breccia.  The climate is humid temperate having a mean annual precipitation of 55 to 80 inches, a mean annual temperature of 46 to 51 degrees F, a mean January temperature of 36 degrees F, and a mean July temperature of 62 degrees F.
