  "OVERVIEW": "The Caribouridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills, and footslopes.  They formed in glacial till and outwash with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.  Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
