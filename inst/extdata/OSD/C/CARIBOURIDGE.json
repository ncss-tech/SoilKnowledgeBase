They formed in glacial till and outwash derived from granite and gneiss rocks, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The average frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
