These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over glacial drift.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days and the growing season at 28 degrees F. is 140 to 170 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are from the mineral surface to 3 inches (possibly Mt. St.  Helens `W' ash), and a cambic horizon from 3 to 17 inches.  Textures are too coarse to meet cambic from 17 to 48 inches.  The upper 33 inches averages ashy-pumiceous with 39 percent pumice and the lower part is pumiceous.  The soil would class as ashy-pumiceous over pumiceous if provide by soil taxonomy.  Need to consider separation of series to a udic soil when associated with the western hemlock plant community.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data available for this soil are 8753007009 (western hemlock-plant community) and 8753007007 (Grand fir-plant community).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
