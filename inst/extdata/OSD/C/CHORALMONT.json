St.  Helens `W' ash), and a cambic horizon from 3 to 17 inches.  Textures are too coarse to meet cambic from 17 to 48 inches.  The upper 33 inches averages ashy-pumiceous with 39 percent pumice and the lower part is pumiceous.  The soil would class as ashy-pumiceous over pumiceous if provide by soil taxonomy.  Need to consider separation of series to a udic soil when associated with the western hemlock plant community.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data available for this soil are 8753007009 (western hemlock-plant community) and 8753007007 (Grand fir-plant community).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
