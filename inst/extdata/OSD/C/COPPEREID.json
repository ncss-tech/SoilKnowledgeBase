Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,340 to 1,950 meters. The climate is cool semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is about 200 to 250 mm, average annual temperature is about 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
