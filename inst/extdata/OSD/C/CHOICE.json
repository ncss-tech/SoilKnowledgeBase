The moisture control section between depths of 7 and 20 inches is moist in some part from December until April and is moist in all parts for at least 45 consecutive days between January to March.  The soil is dry for about 260 days and has a xeric bordering on aridic moisture regime. The soil is clay or silty clay. Calcium carbonate content ranges from 5 to 12 percent throughout the soil and has a slight increase with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, or 5/2. Organic carbon is less than 0.6 percent. At depths of 5 to 17 inches cracks are 0.5 to 2 cm wider when dry. It is slightly to violently effervescent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 5/2 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 5/6; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2; 5Y 4/2, or 5/2.
