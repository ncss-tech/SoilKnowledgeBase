The soil is dry for about 260 days and has a xeric bordering on aridic moisture regime. The soil is clay or silty clay. Calcium carbonate content ranges from 5 to 12 percent throughout the soil and has a slight increase with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, or 5/2. Organic carbon is less than 0.6 percent. At depths of 5 to 17 inches cracks are 0.5 to 2 cm wider when dry. It is slightly to violently effervescent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 5/2 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 5/6; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2; 5Y 4/2, or 5/2.
