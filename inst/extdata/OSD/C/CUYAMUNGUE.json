  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Typically, the soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 60 days following the winter solstice.  It is moist in some part less than 40 percent and moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The soils are driest in May and June.  The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on torric. The deepest C horizon is saturated with ground water for at least one month in most years.  Water within the capillary fringe moistens horizons above the upper boundary of saturation.  This soil occurs in part of its range where adjacent soils are in an aridic (torric) moisture regime bordering on ustic.  Moisture from flood waters and/or capillary rise above the water table create an ustic moisture regime in the soils of these areas.\nMean annual soil temperature - 49 to 54 degrees F.\nParticle-size control section weighted averages - Silicate clay content: 0 to 4 percent; Rock fragment content: 35 to 60 percent, mostly gravel, lithology of fragments is granite, gneiss, and schist; mica content: 1 to 5 percent (by grain count).\nReaction - slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline\nCalcium carbonate equivalent - 0 to 1 percent\nSalinity, mmhos/cm - 0 to 1\nSodicity, SAR - 0 to 1\nAC horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist\nRock fragments: total range is 40 to 60 percent\n35 to 50 percent gravel\n5 to 10 percent cobbles\nOther features: this horizon is a recent stratified deposit and does not qualify as an Ochric epipedon\nupper C horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist\nTexture: stratified gravelly sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand\nRock fragments: total range is 15 to 70 percent, averaging 25 to 55 percent with:\n25 to 50 percent gravel\n0 to 5 percent cobbles\nOther features: pedons have thin strata, lenses, and laminae ranging in texture from loamy fine sand to extremely coarse sand\nlower C horizons\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 2.5 through 5 moist\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist\nTexture: stratified gravelly coarse sand to extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand\nRock fragments: total range is 20 to 70 percent, averaging 35 to 65 percent with:\n35 to 65 percent gravel\n0 to 5 percent cobbles\nOther features: pedons have thin strata, lenses, and laminae ranging in texture from silt loam to fine sand; some pedons have buried horizons of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam below 40 inches which may have distinct to prominent relict redox concentrations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cuyamungue soils are on narrow flood plains of valley floors adjacent to intermittent streams.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist and Tertiary granitic sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 170 days."

Bosquecito soils are coarse-loamy, have seasonal high water tables between 2.0 and 3.5 feet, and occur on flood plains of valley floors.  Jaralosa soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have seasonal high water tables between 3.5 and 5 feet, and occur on flood plains of valley floors."

These soils are subject to frequent, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September.  Floodwaters have high velocity and are generally less than 5 feet deep.  A seasonal high water table is present between 5 and 8 feet."
