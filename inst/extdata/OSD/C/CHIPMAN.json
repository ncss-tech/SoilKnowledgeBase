  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have chroma of 1 or 2. If the chroma is 2, distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations occur above 20 inches. Gleying with 5Y or 5GY colors may occur below 30 inches. The seasonal high water table is between 12 to 30 inches, unless drained.   The surface 1 foot of the soil drys out during the summer months because of low summer rainfall.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 50 degrees F. and the summer soil temperature is 67 degrees to 73 degrees F.\nThere is a calcic horizon above 16 inches. The control section averages silty clay loam or clay loam, with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Layers ranging from loam to silty clay may occur.  These soils are nonsaline to strongly saline and nonalkaline to strongly alkali. They are mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It contains 20 to 33 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Bkg horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3. It contains 30 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chipman soils are on nearly level low lake terraces and stream flood plains at elevations of 4,490 to 4,560 feet. They formed in lacustrine sediments derived mainly from shale and limestone parent rocks. The climate is dry subhumid with a mean annual temperature of 49 degrees to 52 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of about 70 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
