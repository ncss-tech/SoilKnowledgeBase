  "OVERVIEW": "The Chipman series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments from shale and limestone.  Chipman soils are low lake terraces and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Gleying with 5Y or 5GY colors may occur below 30 inches. The seasonal high water table is between 12 to 30 inches, unless drained.   The surface 1 foot of the soil drys out during the summer months because of low summer rainfall.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 50 degrees F. and the summer soil temperature is 67 degrees to 73 degrees F.\nThere is a calcic horizon above 16 inches. The control section averages silty clay loam or clay loam, with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Layers ranging from loam to silty clay may occur.  These soils are nonsaline to strongly saline and nonalkaline to strongly alkali. They are mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It contains 20 to 33 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Bkg horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3. It contains 30 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

The climate is dry subhumid with a mean annual temperature of 49 degrees to 52 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of about 70 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
