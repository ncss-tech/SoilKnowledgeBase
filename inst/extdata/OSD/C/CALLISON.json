Content of rock fragments, commonly slate channers or quartz gravel, ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A and B horizons. The soil is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout, unless limed. Content of feldspar crystals in the lower part of the subsoil ranges from 0 to about 6 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loam or silt loam. In some pedons, it may be dense and slightly cemented.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron or clay depletions and accumulations in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red are common in most pedons. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron or clay depletions and accumulations in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red are common in most pedons.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Docena, Kirksey, Secrest, and Pageland series are in a closely related family. Docena soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and shaly residual sediments on low areas of the Appalachian Plateau and have a depth to bedrock of more than 60 inches. Kirksey soils have a depth to hard bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Secrest soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Pageland soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches and are Alfisols."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Callison soils occur on gently sloping broad ridges to strongly sloping side slopes, and also near heads of drains in uplands in the Southern Piedmont. The soils are formed in materials weathered from Carolina slate or other fine-grained bedrock. Slopes commonly are 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F., the mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 52 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 210 to 225 days."

Badin, Cid, Georgeville, Gundy, Herndon, Lignum, Mandale (T), Nanford, and Tarrus soils have a fine particle-size control section. Montonia soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Goldston soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and a depth to soft bedrock of less than 20 inches. Misenheimer soils have a loamy particle-size control section, have iron depletions throughout the subsoil, and a depth to soft bedrock of less than 20 inches."
