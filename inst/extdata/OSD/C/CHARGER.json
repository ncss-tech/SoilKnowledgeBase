  "OVERVIEW": "The Charger series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in overbank alluvium over channel alluvium from predominantly volcanic rocks.  Charger soils are on proximal alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, (635 mm).  The mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
