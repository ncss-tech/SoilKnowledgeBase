Elevation is 1,900 to 4,200, but mostly below 3,500 feet and on south or west facing slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from mica schist.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  Snowfall ranges from 6 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 76 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
