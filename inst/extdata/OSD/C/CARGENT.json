  "OVERVIEW": "The Cargent series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered dominantly from mica schist.  These soils are on mountains.  Slope is 50 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
