  "OVERVIEW": "The Circleback series consists of deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments. These soils are on nearly level plains to undulating dunes. Slopes are complex with landscape base slopes from 0 to 5 percent and individual dune side slopes from 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 220 days, cumulative, in normal years. April and October through November are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in December through March and May through September.\nMean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F).\nSolum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in)\nParticle-size control section: 2 to 10 percent silicate clay.\nDepth of solum is 203 cm (80 in) or more. Combined thickness of the A and E horizon is 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). Mixed texture of all horizons is sand or fine sand with a clay content of about l to about 8 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous throughout\nA horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: sand, fine sand\nEffervescence: none\nReaction: neutral\nE horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist\nChroma 3 to 6\nTexture: sand, fine sand\nEffervescence: none\nReaction: neutral\nE and Bt horizons:\nHue: 5YR\nValue: 5 to 6, 4 to 5 moist\nChroma: 4 to 8\nEffervescence: none\nReaction: neutral to slightly alkaline\nThe E and Bt horizons alternate.  At least one E and Bt horizon occurs in the solum which contains at least 2 lamellae that are l mm (0.04 in) or more in thickness.  The total thickness of lamellae more than l cm (0.4 in) thick to a depth of 152 cm (60 in) is less than l5 cm (6 in). The lamellae are too thin or too few to be an argillic horizon.  Lamella are from l to 30 mm (0.04 to 1.2 in) thick and loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam in texture."
