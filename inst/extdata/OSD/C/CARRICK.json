Crow soils have albic horizons and Bt/E horizons.  Dargol soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Lubrecht, Ordnance, Pashua, and Rittel soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Fuera and Overgaard soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments within the control section.  Hibbing and Overgaard soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Nester and Silverchief soils are calcareous in the subsoil or substratum. Ponil soils are less than 36 inches to the base of the Bt horizon."

Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 60 inches (Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
