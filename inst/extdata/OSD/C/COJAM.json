  "OVERVIEW": "The Cojam series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Cojam soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
