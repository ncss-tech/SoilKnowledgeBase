  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts from April 20 to June 5.  It is dry in all parts June 20 to September 20.  The moisture control section is moist in some parts slightly more than 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil is commonly calcareous throughout, but in some pedons it may be noncalcareous to a depth of 6 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 20 percent silt, and 65 to 80 percent sand.  The particle-size control section is generally free of rock fragments, but in some pedons below 40 inches, thin strata may occur containing 10 to 35 percent pebbles dominantly less than one inch in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and a chroma of 1 through 3.  If the value is less than 3.5 moist and 5.5 dry, the thickness is not sufficient to qualify for a mollic epipedon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, sandy clay loam, or loam with a weighted average of sandy loam.  Very gravelly modifiers may occur below 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15 inches, with approximately 50 percent falling as snow.  July and August are the driest months of the growing season.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 75 to 105 days.  Elevation is 5,300 to 7,800 feet."

Diagnostic features include an ochric epipedon from 0 to 9 inches after mixing; coarse-loamy texture control section; an ustic aridic moisture regime; and a frigid temperature regime.  Last updated by the state 6/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
