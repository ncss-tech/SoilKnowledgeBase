  "OVERVIEW": "The Chugter series consist of very deep, well drained soils on fans, footslopes and terraces.  The soils formed in alluvium from residuum and have slope ranging from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees and mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40 -inch control section is loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and 2 to 30 percent hard shale or sandstone gravel.  There may be a lithic or paralithic contact below 40 inches.  Chugter soils are usually dry but the surface horizons are occasionally wetted by summer rains of more than one inch intensity.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The soil has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bw horizon has color value of 5 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It has weak to moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure and in some pedons has very thin clay bridging between sand grains.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Segregated lime occurs as few to common fine threads, films or masses and as coatings on the underside of shale and sandstone pebbles."

They formed in loam and gravelly loam alluvium from calcareous sedimentary rock sources.  At the type location the major source of the parent material is the red colored (burned) shale and sandstones of the Tongue River geologic formation associated with burned coal beds.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 115 to 130 days."

Fort Collins, McRae and Thurlow soils have hue yellower than 7.5Y and Fort Collins and Thurlow soils have argillic horizons.  Heldt soils have clayey textures.  Wibaux have fragmental material and Travesilla soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches."
