The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 3 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 to 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/6, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 4/6.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 20 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4; or 7.5YR 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 2 to 35 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors the same as the Bt horizon.  It is stratified, very or extremely gravelly loam, sandy loam, clay loam and sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is characterized by cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."
