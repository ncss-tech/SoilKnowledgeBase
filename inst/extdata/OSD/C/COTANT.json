  "OVERVIEW": "The Cotant series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, rhyolite, and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. Cotant soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
