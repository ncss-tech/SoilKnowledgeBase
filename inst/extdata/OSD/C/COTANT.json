  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cotant soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, rhyolite, and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,590 to 2,445 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
