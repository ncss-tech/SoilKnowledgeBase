  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiricahua series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic and metamorphic rock. Chiricahua soils are on pediments, hills, and mountains and have slopes of 1 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (356 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F (16.7 degrees C).",
