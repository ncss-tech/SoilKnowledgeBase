  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coppercreek soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridgetops. Slope gradients are 9 to 75 percent. Elevations are 15 to 874 meters (50 to 2870 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist, sandstone, and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 255 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 240 to 300 days."

Atwell, Tectah, and Trailhead soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections. Lackscreek and Slidecreek soils are loamy-skeletal in their control sections. Ahpah and Lackscreek soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to bedrock. The Atwell and Devilscreek soils are in wet hillslope hollows below the Coppercreek soils. The Ahpah and Lackscreek soils are on convex slopes or on spur ridges above the Coppercreek soils. The Slidecreek soils are alongside the Coppercreek soils on very gravelly colluvium. The Tectah and Trailhead soils are above the Coppercreek soils on gentler slopes."
