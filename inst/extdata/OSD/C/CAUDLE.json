  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The concept of the Nevada soil named Caudle was originally that of a sodium affected series.  This soil was proposed as a Natrargid under the series name of Ikes.  It was lost in the final correlation of Big Smoky Valley Area in 1972.  The Caudle series was originally mapped in Modoc and Lassen counties in California in MLRAs 23 and 26. Responsibility for the series was transferred to Nevada in 1993. The current concept of the Caudle series needs examination even for drainage class when MLRA 28B is updated in the future.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 36 cm (Bt and Btqk horizons).\nDuric feature - The zone from 20 to 36 cm (Btqk horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 36 cm (Bt and Btqk horizons)."
