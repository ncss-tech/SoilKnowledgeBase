  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiswell series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in materials weathered from shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

Rock fragments of shale, siltstone, or fine-grained sandstone range from 5 to 70 percent in the A horizon, from 20 to 80 percent in the Bw horizon, and from 45 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments average more than 35 percent in the textural control section.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon,where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered shale, siltstone, or interbedded sandstone."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Cataska and Petros soils are in the same family.  Cataska soils have slate or phyllite rock fragments and occur mostly in the Blue Ridge physiographic province.  Petros soils have hard bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches, and occur mostly on high ridge tops in the Cumberland Plateau.\nKlinesville, Nassau, Sylvatus, Unicoi, and Weikert soils are in closely related families.  These soils have hard bedrock between depths of 10 and 20 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soils now within the range of the Chiswell series were correlated in Berks, Klinesville, Webbtown, and Weikert in several published soil surveys.  The Chiswell soils are mapped on the Rome- Waynesboro formation.      Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon). 2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 13 inches (Bw horizon). 3.  Paralithic contact - shallow depth to soft shale bedrock at 13 inches (Cr horizon)."

  "ADDITIONAL DATA": {
    "section": "ADDITIONAL DATA",
    "content": "ADDITIONAL DATA:  Ranges for morphology, chemistry, particle-size distribution, and sand and silt minerals are based on 21 pedons. Ranges for clay minerals are based on 12 pedons.  Dominant minerals in the sand fraction are quartz, 11 to 89 percent, and feldspar, 8 to 36 percent.  Dominant minerals in the silt fraction are quartz, 53 to 83 percent, and feldspar, 17 to 46 percent.  Dominant minerals in the clay fraction are mica, 11 to 74 percent; quartz, 5 to 45 percent; vermiculite, 5 to 28 percent; and kaolinite, 2 to 7 percent.  Some of these data are contained in: 1.
