    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously mapped as Oxalis and Panoche series in the Soil Survey of the Mendota Area, California, Series 1940, No. 18 and in the Soil Survey of the Coalinga Area, California, Series 1944, No 1.\nClay texture is the dominant surface texture of this soil and texture which was determined in the field, therefore clay texture was described in the Ap1 horizon. The laboratory data showed 39.3 percent clay.  This soil occurs in an area which is subject to dramatic changes in soil salinity and sodicity due to position on the landscape (fan skirts) and the prevalence of perched water tables near the surface.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\nThe Ciervo series was initially classified as Vertic Torriorthents. This was changed to Vertic Haplocambids when a cambic horizon was described in the Ciervo profiles. The presence of a cambic horizon is based on the following characteristics:\n1. Soil structure in the cambic horizon (unless moist from irrigation or  rainfall or drastically modified by deep ripping).\n2. Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon.\n3. Accumulation of carbonates or gypsum below the cambic horizon which supports loss of carbonate or gypsum from overlying horizons.\n4. Higher chroma in the cambic horizon in some pedons.\n5. Most areas of Ciervo soil are irrigated with 2 to 3 feet of water per year applied for crop production. Previous to irrigation, only about 7 inches of precipitation, coupled with flood water, was available for soil development. Movement of carbonates, gypsum, fertilizers, and salt through the soil profile has created more pronounced cambic horizons because of application of irrigation water.\n1. Ochric Epipedon--0 to 17 inches (Ap1, Ap2).\n1.1 Cambic Horizon -- 17 to 27 inches (Bw).\n1.2 Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon. Pedons which have a horizon with 5 percent gypsum qualify for a gypsic horizon. They are not classified as gypsic horizons however, because 5 percent gypsum is the minimum requirement for a gypsic horizon and 5 percent gypsum is the maximum gypsum found in the Ciervo series. In all instances where gypsum content is as high as 5 percent, there have been significant amounts of gypsum that have been added as a soil amendment.\n1.3 Zone of redistribution -- 27 to 60 inches (Bknyz, Bknz).\nOther Diagnostic Features and Characteristics:\n1. Fine Family\n1.1 NSSL results show 34 to 47 percent clay in the typical pedon. There is an average 45 percent clay from 10 to 40 inches.\n2. Smectitic Mineralogy\n2.1 X-ray diffraction studies show smectite is the dominant clay mineral in this soil.\n3. Thermic Temperature Regime\n3.1 Soil temperature regime is assumed to be thermic based upon data from Mendota Dam and Panoche Junction. MAAT is 62 to 64 degrees F.\n4. Vertic Subgroup\n4.1 Linear extensibility percent is 8for the typical pedon to a depth of 104 cm.\n4.2 Since this soil is cultivated and irrigated, cracks are difficult to observe. If unirrigated, cracks are assumed to be at least 5 mm wide at a depth of 50 cm, at least 30 cm long in some part, and extend upward to the soil surface or the base of an Ap horizon.\n5. Torric Moisture Regime\n5.1 Unless irrigated, the 4 to 12 inch SMCS is assumed to be dry in all parts from April 1 to December 1 and is moist in some or all parts for only 70 to 90 consecutive days. Based upon data from Mendota Dam (MAP 7.7 inches) and Panoche Junction (MAP 6.0 inches) climate stations.\n5.2 The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F. from January to December (365 days).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data pedon sample number S85CA019-005 (5375-5379) for the typical pedon.  Other pedons with NSSL data are S85CA019-004 (5369-5374) and S86CA019-012 (3158-3162).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
