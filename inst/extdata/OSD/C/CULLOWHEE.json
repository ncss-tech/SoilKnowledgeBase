  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  Sandy C horizons that  contain more that 35 percent by volume gravel and/or cobbles are within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Gravel and/or cobbles are in the A and AC horizons of some pedons but comprise less than 35 percent.  Content of mica flakes is few to common.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  In some pedons, there is a recently deposited thin layer of loamy or sandy overwash.  Also, most pedons have an Ab horizon that ranges from sand to loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has the same color range as the A horizon.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is mottled in chroma of 2 or less within 20 inches of the surface.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon below a depth of 20 inches that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of l or 2.  It has the same textures as the Bw horizon.  The Bg horizon, where present, does not immediately underlie the umbric epipedon.\nThe C or C' horizons, where present, are similar in color to the Bw horizon.  If they immediately underlie the umbric epipedon, mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 20 inches of the surface.  Some pedons have a Cg horizon below a depth of 20 inches. The Cg horizon, where present, is similar in color to the Bg horizon.  The C and Cg horizons, in the upper part are usually sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, but range to include sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loam.  Within depths of 20 to 40 inches,the C or Cg horizons are sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments by volume."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family. Soil series in related families are the Arkaqua, Colvard, Comus, Craigsville, Dellwood, French, Iotla, Ela, Nikwasi, Ostin, Potomac, Rosman, and Toxaway soils.  Arkaqua, Colvard, Comus, Iotla, Rosman, and Toxaway soils lack sandy-skeletal material within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Craigsville soils are loamy-skeletal.  Dellwood, Potomac and Ostin soils are sandy-skeletal.  French soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Ela and Nikwasi soils are poorly to very poorly drained with dominant chroma of 2 or less immediately underlying the umbric epipedon. Nikwasi soils have  A horizons thicker than 24 inches.  Reddies soils are moderately well drained and do not have chroma 2 or less mottles within a depth of 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cullowhee soils are on nearly level, relatively narrow flood plains in the upper reaches of watersheds in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in recent alluvium consisting of loamy material that is moderately deep to sandy, gravelly, and /or cobbly strata.  Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Craigsville, Dellwood, French, Ela, Nikwasi, Ostin, Potomac, Reddies, and Toxaway soils.  Craigsville, Dellwood, Ostin, Potomac, and Reddies soils are better drained and are typically nearer to the stream channels than Cullowhee soils.  French soils are in similar positions to Cullowhee soils.  Ela, Nikwasi and Toxaway soils are wetter and are farther from stream channels."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is used for hay, corn, pasture, truck crops, or ornamental crops. The rest is mainly in hardwood forest.   Common trees are yellow poplar, red maple, sycamore, yellow birch, and river birch.  A few areas have been planted to eastern white pine.  Common understory plants include rhododendron, sedges, and eastern hemlock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils now placed in the Cullowhee series were previously included in the Iotla and French series. However, these soils lack an umbric epipedon. In addition, Iotla soils lack sandy-skeletal material within a depth of 40 inches, and French soils are fine-loamy.  This revision classifies Cullowhee soils in the Aquic Haplumbrepts subgroup which was added to \"Soil Taxonomy\" by \"National Soil Taxonomy Handbook Issue No. 13\", October, 11, 1989.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nUmbric Epipedon - 0 to 13 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nDominant chroma of more than 2 immediately underlying the umbric epipedon, and mottles of chroma 2 within 20 inches of the surface.\nSandy-skeletal material at a depth of 35 inches (C' horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nMLRA: 130B       SIR: NC0209\nRevised 02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
