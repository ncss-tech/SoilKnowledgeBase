  "OVERVIEW": "The Carr series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained, soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature at the type location is about 12.2 degrees C.(54 degrees F.). Mean annual precipitation is 71 centimeters (28 inches).",
