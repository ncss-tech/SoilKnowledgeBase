  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of quartzite, chert and schist range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 30 percent in the B horizon, and from 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Some areas have large stones on the surface.  Clay minerals are mostly kaolinite, vermiculite and chlorite.  Most pedons have flakes of mica that generally increase with depth.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, very strongly acid to neutral in the B horizon, and medium acid to midly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have a subhorizon with hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The B horizon fine earth texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is moderate, fine, medium, and coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Fine earth texture is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  The C horizon is friable or firm."

These soils are on end moraines and ground moraines. Belmont soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Belmore soils have water worn gravels throughout. Caprell soils formed in as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of loess or other silty material and in loamy till. Chili, Kanawha Martinsville, Ockley, and  Princeton soils are stratified in the lower part of the solum. Cliftycreek soils formed in up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till and clayey residuum overlying bedrock high in carbonates. Crouse soils formed in a thin layer of loess and recent Wisconsinan till over older Wisconsinan till mixed with Illinoian till on terminal moraines. Gallman soils formed in poorly sorted outwash with a high content of shale of fine gravel size. Greybrook soils formed in loess and an underlying paleosol in lacustrine sediments. Hickory soils have redax feature in the lower part of the solum. High Gap and Military  soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Hollinger, Relay, and Strawn soils have a thinner solum. Kidder, soils have free carbonates in the control section.  Kosciusko, Riddles and Wawasee soils have more sand in the control section. Leroy  soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying highly calcareous loamy till. Lumberton soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash over residuum of limestone. Pignut soils formed in residuum of greenstone or greenstone schist on ridges in the foothills and mountains of the Blue Ridge. Richardville soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess and in the underlying till. Senachwine soils formed in as much as 18 inches of loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy till. Skeleton soils formed in loamy and silty sediments. Turnersburg soils formed in residuum from intermediate or mafic metamorphic or igneous rock. Wawaka that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess and in the underlying till over outwash. Wawasee soils formed in glacial till on moraines and till plains. Woodbine soils have an upper solum formed in loess and glacial till and a lower solum formed in the residuum weathered from limestone.\nBlackhammer, Chenault Coggon, Douds, El Dara Grellton, Hayden, Hebron, Kalamazoo, Kendallville, Letort, Lindley, Mandeville, McHenry, Miami, Mifflin, Nodine, Norden, Owosso, Pecatonica, Rawson, Renova, Richland, Rockbridge, Roseville, Sisson, Summitville, Theresa, Westville, Whalan series are similar in related families.\nBlackhammer soils have a solum greater than 60 inches thick. Chenault soils are formed in old alluvium. Coggon, Hayden, Pecatonia, Renova, and Westville soils formed in glacial till. Douds, El Dara, Hebron, Kalamazoo, Kendallville, Nodine, and Sisson soils are stratified in the lower part of the solum. Grellton soils have more sand in the upper part of the Bt horizon. Letort soils have a Bt horizon with dominantly lower value and chroma. Lindley soils have coarse fragments of glacial pebbles. Mandeville soils have coarse fragments of micaceous shale. McHenry, Miami, and Theresa soils have free carbonates in the control section. Mifflin, Owosso and Roseville soils have more sand in the control section. Norden, and Whalan soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Rawson soils have redox feature in the lower part of the solum. Richland and Summitville soils have coarse fragments of siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Rockbridge soils have 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments of pebbles, gravels, and cobblestones in the lower part of the solum."
