The average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F."

The well drained Guanajibo soils are on lower positions and have more than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil.  The well drained Mucara soils are on higher positions and are moderately deep to volcanic bedrock.  The well drained Voladora soils are on lower positions and have more clay in the control section."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\nVertic features - the zone from 2 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\nThe Cabo Rojo series was formerly classified in the Red and Yellow Podzolic Great Soil Group.  The type location was moved to its present location in 2005. The classification was updated with the 11/04 draft from Fine, mixed, semiactive, isohyperthermic Aquic Paleudults to Fine, mixed, semiactive, isohyperthermic Vertic Paleudults.  Low chroma mottles appear to have been inherited from the parent material and are not thought to be due to wetness.\nCabo Rojo soils are in MLRA 270.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; S04PR-023-005R. Sample by NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 05/05.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
