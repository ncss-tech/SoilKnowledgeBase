  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume, throughout the soil.\nSome pedons have an O horizon composed of fibric or hemic material. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have an Ap less than 10 inches thick that ranges to a fine sandy loam texture. It has fine or medium granular structure or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have an A horizon in place of the Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is dominantly fine sand but ranges to loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. It has subangular blocky structure or is single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is dominantly fine sand, but ranges to loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. It is single grain and loose or very friable. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. There may be thin strata that vary from the textural range, but the average texture of the C horizon stays within the given range. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

Abbeylake and Corliss soils have free carbonates in the series control section. Cantlin and Feldtmann soils have redder hues in the substratum. Claire and Grayling soils are not dominated by fine sand or loamy fine sand in the 10-40 inch control section and have a lower moisture content in the series control section during the growing season. Danjay and Plainbo soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Friendship soils have redox accumulations in the series control section. Hiawatha soils have redder hues in the surface. Mahtomedi soils have a higher content of rock fragments and a lower moisture content during the growing season. Menahga and Nymore soils have 30 percent or more medium or coarser sand in the series control section. Sartell soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for more than 30 consecutive days in the 120 days following the summer solstice. Shawano soils have a lower moisture content in the series control section during the growing season. Serden and Sunday soils lack a B horizon and are drier."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Champlain soils are on sandy glacial outwash plains, terraces and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in water-deposited sand derived predominantly from anorthositic gneiss with some marble. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 50 inches, and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 500 to 3000 feet above sea level."

The Becket and Pyrites soils are in low and medium lime till deposits respectively, that occur on nearby uplands. Moderately well drained Depeyster and somewhat poorly drained Roundabout soils are silty soils that occur in nearby lacustrine deposits. Colton soils occupy adjacent positions on outwash plains and are skeletal. Naumburg soils are somewhat poorly and poorly drained, and occupy adjacent depressional areas."
