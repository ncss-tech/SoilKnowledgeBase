These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent hard rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam, ashy loam, or gravelly ashy loam and is greater than 60 percent volcanic ash and cinders combined.  It contains 5 to 10 percent hard weathered cinders and 5 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe 2E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It contains 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 5 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is highly weathered breccia exhibiting rock structure and the weathered pebbles causes a mottled appearance.  Some pedons have redox features with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 1 through 3 moist."

Christoff soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders overlying highly weathered breccia and tuffaceous material.  The climate is maritime with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 80 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and rainfall during winter.  Mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
