The presence of coarse spherical, moderately cemented, carbonate nodules indicate a deposition of alluvium with a different lithology than the recent alluvium in the upper part of the solum.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU data from Kleberg County, Texas (S06TX-273-003)\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
