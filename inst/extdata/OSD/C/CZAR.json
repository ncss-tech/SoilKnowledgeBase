  "OVERVIEW": "The Czar series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial and eolian sediments of Holocene age over loamy alluvium deposits of Quaternary age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
