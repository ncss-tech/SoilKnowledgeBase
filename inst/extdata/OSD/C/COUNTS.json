  "OVERVIEW": "The Counts series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable upland soils that formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium over interbedded shale and sandstone bedrock. The bedrock is of Pennsylvanian age.  These nearly level to strongly sloping upland soils are in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains (MLRA 119) and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges (MLRA 118A and 118B).  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.",

Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, red, and gray.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has colors, redoxmorphic features, and textures similar to the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons.  Most pedons are coarsely mixed in shades of brown, gray, yellow, and red.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.

Carnasaw, Clearview, Linker, Pirum, Sobol, and Wister soils have a sola less than 60 inches thick and are on sideslopes of associated landscapes above the Counts soils.  Clebit soils have a sola less than 20 inches thick, lack Bt horizons, and are on ridgecrests of associated landscapes above the Counts soils.  Sallisaw, Stigler, Tamaha, Wilburton, Wing, and Wister soils are on nearby landscapes.  In addition, Sallisaw soils have fine-loamy control sections, Stigler and Tamaha soils lack an abrupt textural change, Wilburton soils have a loamy-skeletal control section, and Wing soils have Bt horizons high in sodium.  Shermore soils have fragipans and are on footslopes of associated landscapes above Counts soils."
