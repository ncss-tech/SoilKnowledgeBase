It is silt loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and\nchroma of 2 to 4.  Texture, reaction, and base saturation are\nsimilar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, red, and gray.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has colors, redoxmorphic features, and textures similar to the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons.  Most pedons are coarsely mixed in shades of brown, gray, yellow, and red.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  The exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 4 to 16.\nSome pedons have BC horizons.  They have color, reaction, and\ntexture similar to the Bt3 horizon."

They formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium over interbedded shale and sandstone.  The shale and sandstone is of Pennsylvanian age.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 64 to 80."

Burwell soils have a fine-silty control sections and are on mounds. Carnasaw, Clearview, Linker, Pirum, Sobol, and Wister soils have a sola less than 60 inches thick and are on sideslopes of associated landscapes above the Counts soils.  Clebit soils have a sola less than 20 inches thick, lack Bt horizons, and are on ridgecrests of associated landscapes above the Counts soils.  Sallisaw, Stigler, Tamaha, Wilburton, Wing, and Wister soils are on nearby landscapes.  In addition, Sallisaw soils have fine-loamy control sections, Stigler and Tamaha soils lack an abrupt textural change, Wilburton soils have a loamy-skeletal control section, and Wing soils have Bt horizons high in sodium.  Shermore soils have fragipans and are on footslopes of associated landscapes above Counts soils."
