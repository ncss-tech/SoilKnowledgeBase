  "OVERVIEW": "The Coalbank series consists of deep and very deep, well drained moderately rapidly permeable soils that are formed in alluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated volcanic ash.  They are on mesa sides, mountain sides, hill sides, and terraces and have slopes of 4 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.",
