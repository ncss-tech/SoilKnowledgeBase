  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiloquinot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock, diatomaceous silt and tephra. Chiloquinot soils are on flood plains and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
