  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cruice series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt. Cruice soils are on upper positions of lava fields formed from non-viscous lava flows. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",
