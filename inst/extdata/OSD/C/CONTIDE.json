(Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 32 inches.  (E/B horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 32 to 56 inches.  Bt horizons)\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August, 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Cryoboralfs to Typic Palecryalfs.  Format and horizonation designations were updated. It was stated in the 1971 description that the argillic horizon started below 24 inches, hence the current Palecryalf classification.  However, if the mixed clay content of the E/B horizon is later determined to meet the minimum required clay increase for an argillic horizon, then the top of the argillic horizon would be the top of the E/B horizon.  If the argillic starts at the E/B then the particle-size class would probably be fine-loamy and mixed instead of fine and smectitic. The series has not been updated by the state since 1971.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999."
