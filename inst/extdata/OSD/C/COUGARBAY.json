  "OVERVIEW": "The Cougarbay series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in recent lake laid sediments. Cougarbay soils are on low-lying bottomland areas adjacent to lakes and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Depth to the stratified sandy material is 28 to 35 inches but average 30 inches. Surface cracks are present upon drying in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay or silty clay loam with more than 35 percent clay. Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 through 8. They are common or many and distinct or prominent.\nThe 3Cg horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry. This horizon is stratified coarse and or loamy coarse sand with very thin layers of finer textured materials. Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, and chroma of 4 through 6. They are distinct to prominent.\nThe 4Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry. It is silty clay or silty clay loam. Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, and chroma of 4 through 6. They are common or many, distinct or prominent. This horizon is generally always saturated."
