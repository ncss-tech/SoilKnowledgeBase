    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 47 degrees F. The soils are saturated to the surface during spring runoff. Depth to the stratified sandy material is 28 to 35 inches but average 30 inches. Surface cracks are present upon drying in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay or silty clay loam with more than 35 percent clay. Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 through 8. They are common or many and distinct or prominent.\nThe 3Cg horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry. This horizon is stratified coarse and or loamy coarse sand with very thin layers of finer textured materials. Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, and chroma of 4 through 6. They are distinct to prominent.\nThe 4Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry. It is silty clay or silty clay loam. Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, and chroma of 4 through 6. They are common or many, distinct or prominent. This horizon is generally always saturated."

The soils formed in recent lake laid sediments with lenses of sandy alluvium. The soils are in a climate with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. Mean January temperature is about 25 percent F.; mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 42 degrees to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
