    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The BA horizon has few to common, fine to coarse, distinct or prominent redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  The Bt, BC, and C horizons have few to common, fine to coarse, distinct or prominent redoximorphic accumulations and depletion masses in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 30 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, values of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, values of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 (4 to 7 dry), and chroma of 0 to 3.  Texture is clay loam, clay, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent and sand content is more than 30 percent in the textural control section. Some pedons are calcareous in the lower Bt horizon and contain few, fine, or medium soft rounded accumulations of calcium carbonate.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe BCt or BC horizons have hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 (4 to 7 dry), and chroma of 0 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay, or sandy clay.  It is usually calcareous and contains few or common, fine soft rounded accumulations of calcium carbonate.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 (4 to 7 dry), and chroma of 0 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. Reaction is moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Muldrow and Santee series in the same family.  Muldrow soils are noncalcareous throughout and have less than 30 percent sand in the upper 20 inches of the control section.  Santee soils lack calcium carbonate concretions in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are moist for longer periods of time."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carwile soils are on nearly level or concave treads of stream terraces, or depressions of sand sheets on alluvial plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in alluvium or eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  The climate is dry or moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 38 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 34 to 64.  Frost free days range from 185 to 230."

Devol, Grandfield, Lovedale, Meno, and Miles soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and occur on slightly higher areas.  In addition, Devol, Drummond, Eda, Grandfield, Miles, Meno, and Nobscot soils, do not have mollic epipedons. Drummond soils occur on flood plains.  Meno, Nobscot, and Eda soils are on slightly higher areas."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Carwile soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible to low and ponding occurs in depressional areas.  This soil has epipsaturation (a perched water table) on top of the relatively impermeable subsoil, which causes ponding of water on the soil surface for brief to long duration from October through June.  Ponding depth ranges from 0 to 12 inches (30cm).  One or more layers are saturated within 200 cm of the soil surface for some time in most years, but not continuous, and also has one or more unsaturated layers with an upper boundary above 200 cm depth, below the saturated layer.  The top of the perched water table ranges from 0 to 36 inches (90 cm) from October through June.  The lower boundary ranges from 24 inches (60 cm) to 60 inches (150 cm)."
