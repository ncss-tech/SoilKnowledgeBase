  "STATES": "KS,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Carwile series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium or eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level or concave stream terraces on alluvial plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Water runs off the surface at a negligible or low rate or is ponded.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.",

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Carwile soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible to low and ponding occurs in depressional areas.  This soil has epipsaturation (a perched water table) on top of the relatively impermeable subsoil, which causes ponding of water on the soil surface for brief to long duration from October through June.  Ponding depth ranges from 0 to 12 inches (30cm).  One or more layers are saturated within 200 cm of the soil surface for some time in most years, but not continuous, and also has one or more unsaturated layers with an upper boundary above 200 cm depth, below the saturated layer.  The top of the perched water table ranges from 0 to 36 inches (90 cm) from October through June.  The lower boundary ranges from 24 inches (60 cm) to 60 inches (150 cm)."
