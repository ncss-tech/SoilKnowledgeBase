  "REVDATE": "04/2008",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheosa series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils on nearly level to undulating hillcrests.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from the basal Jeff Conglomerate member of the Pruett Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, with most occurring from July to September.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 feet."

In addition, Cesario soils are deep to Cretaceous shale bedrock and Fizzleflat soils are moderately deep to Cretaceous shale bedrock.  These soils are lower in the landscape on gently sloping uplands.  Loyplace soils are lower in the landscape on footslope positions.  Mariscal soils are very shallow and shallow to flaggy limestone bedrock and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that do not have a calcic horizon.  They are on alluvial flats and floodplains and formed in zeolitic alluvium derived from tuffaceous materials."
