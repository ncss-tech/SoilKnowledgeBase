    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cheosa soils are on gently undulating to undulating erosional uplands, usually on hillcrest landforms.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from the basal Jeff Conglomerate member of the Eocene age Pruett Formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, with most occurring from July to September.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cesario, Fizzleflat, Loyplace, Mariscal, and Straddlebug series.  Cesario and Fizzleflat soils are in the fine-loamy family.  In addition, Cesario soils are deep to Cretaceous shale bedrock and Fizzleflat soils are moderately deep to Cretaceous shale bedrock.  These soils are lower in the landscape on gently sloping uplands.  Loyplace soils are lower in the landscape on footslope positions.  Mariscal soils are very shallow and shallow to flaggy limestone bedrock and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that do not have a calcic horizon.  They are on alluvial flats and floodplains and formed in zeolitic alluvium derived from tuffaceous materials."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 3 to 12 inches (Bk horizon)\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zone from 12 to 32 inches (Bkm and Bkym horizons).\nLithic Contact - The boundary at 32 inches (R horizon)\nSuperactive cation exchange activity class - CEC to percent clay ratio is 0.60 or greater.  This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Pruett Tuff, which overlies the Jeff Conglomerate; and laboratory data from similar soils in Presidio County, Texas\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nMoisture and temperature regime revised for Brewster County, TX, Main Part, 2/8/08, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
