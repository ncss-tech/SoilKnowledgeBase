  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the Bk horizon ranges from 5 to 13 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F., and the mean annual summer temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The family textural control section is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam averaging between 10 and 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The depth to the base of the Bw horizon, when present, is less than 10 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent except in discontinuous pockets or thin strata in the Bk horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where the color is as dark or darker than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, the horizon has chroma of 4 or is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  Texture is typically silt loam, but may be loam.  It ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.  Lime is disseminated.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is typically silt loam, but may be loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Lime is disseminated.  The Bw horizon may be absent in some pedons.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma 3 through 6.  Lime is present as many fine and medium, irregularly shaped, segregated seams and soft masses which appear to be the result of in-place weathering with some local segregation.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

The Colnevee soils formed in silty alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Elevation is 4,600 to 6,000 feet.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
