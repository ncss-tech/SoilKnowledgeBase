  "OVERVIEW": "The Colonymill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist and other metasedimentary rocks. The Colonymill soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 100 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 945 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
