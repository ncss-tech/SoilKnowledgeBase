These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 9 to 13 inches thick.  The 10 to 40 inch, particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.25 g/cc, 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass content, including 5 to 15 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm diameter and 5 to 10 percent pumice, 2 to 5 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 5 to 20 percent rock fragments and an apparent field estimated clay content of 3 to 10 percent.  Depth to a weakly or moderately cemented duripan is 40 to 60 or more inches.  Some phases have granitic bedrock, extremely cobbly sand, fine sandy loam or noncemented very cobbly sandy loam substratum from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizons have hue 10YR or 2.5Y.  Value is 5,6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, chroma is 2, 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  The lower part is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist.  Chroma is 1,2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is weakly or moderately cemented duripan and has 25 to 35 percent rock fragments. Fine earth texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam when crushed.  Reaction is slightly to very strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Cdk horizon has moist value of 5 or 6.  Chroma is 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It has 30 to 40 percent rock fragments. Fine earth texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly to very strongly alkaline."

The DelRio series is in depressions and lack pumice over 2mm in size and have rare flooding on nearly level to gently sloping areas.  Dryhollow series average over 25 percent pumice greater than 2 mm in lower part of control section.  Bitner, Brays, Deskamp, Kester and Widblow series are moderately deep to bedrock.  Yellowhills series has 60 to 80 percent volcanic glass in the particle-size control section.  Emagert soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F., a field estimated clay content of 18 to 27 percent and a mollic epipedon of 24 to 48 inches.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chelan soils are on terraces and side slopes leading up to upland plateau.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash and pumice primarily over weakly cemented duripan and dense granitic glacial till.  Some phases are over granitic bedrock, glacial outwash, fine sandy loam or noncemented glacial till at 40 to 60 or more inches depth.  Elevation is 1,000 to 2,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 145 to 200 days."
