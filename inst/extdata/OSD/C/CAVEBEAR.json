  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cavebear soils are on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
