These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic rock such as dacitic breccia, basalt and rhyolite.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 220 days"
