Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is more than 35 percent by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Content of rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated mudstone."

Agueybana (T) and Maricao soils have an argillic horizon and have finer textured profiles. Cuchillas and Rubias (T) soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Chiquito soil is in a perudic soil moisture regime. Chiquito soils formed in the Yauco Mudstone Formation (Ky)."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 18 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nLithic contact - the contact at 18 inches (R layer).\nChiquito soils were formerly included in the Caguabo series. A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nChiquito soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
