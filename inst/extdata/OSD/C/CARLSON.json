  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Depth to free carbonates in the form of films, threads, or soft masses ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.  It is 35 to 45 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon contains 20 to 40 percent by volume of carbonates in the form of soft masses.  The upper boundary of the 2Bk horizon is within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  In a few pedons it is loamy sand or sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches."

Beadle, Kirley, McClure, Peno, and Raber soils contain less carbonates in the C horizon.  In addition, Beadle, Peno, and Raber soils formed in glacial till.  Harney, Reliance, and Spearville soils formed in loess and lacked old alluvial sediment above depths of 40 inches.  Mento soils have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons.  Campus, Penden, and Wakeen soils lack an argillic horizon."

The soils formed in loess over calcareous old alluvial deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 32 to 42."
