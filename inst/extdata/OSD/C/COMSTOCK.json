  "OVERVIEW": "The Comstock series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mostly silty lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 28 to 60 inches.  Depth to stratification range from 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments typically are absent throughout the soil, but some pedons have up to 3 percent gravel and cobbles.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, but it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Iron accumulations are throughout the pedon below the A horizon.  Iron depletions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Saturation occurs in the upper 10 inches of the argillic at some time in most years.\nThe Ap has value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 2 to 5 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nComstock soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has color and texture like the Bt horizon described below.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has thin strata of coarser or finer texture in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6.  They are dominantly  silt loam, but typically have thin strata of silty clay loam, silt, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sand,  very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or loam."

Maplehurst soils have sandy outwash in the lower part of the series control section at 40 to 60 inches.  Crystal Lake soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less or aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.   Poskin soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.  The water table is perched over stratified lacustrine sediments but in most years will eventually saturate the lacustrine sediments and exhibit an apparent water table."
