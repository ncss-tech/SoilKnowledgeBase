  "OVERVIEW": "The Cortyzack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Cortyzack soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 24 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 24 to 45 inches.  (Bk1 horizons)\nThese soils have an aridic ustic soil moisture regime.  The color range for the dry values in the top 6 inches is 3 to 5, which overlaps with Aridic Argiborolls and Typic Argiborolls.  This pedon has color values dry of 4 in the top 6 inches and thus is classified as a Typic Argiboroll.\nThe classification was changed from Typic Argiborolls to frigid Calcidic Argiustolls 12/98.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998."
