  "OVERVIEW": "The Cooperdraw series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Cooperdraw soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
