Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Anawalt and Ninemile soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have an abrupt increase in clay content. Brace soils are fine-loamy and moderately deep to duripans overlying lithic contacts. Anawalt, Brace, and Ninemile soils are on plateaus. Felcher soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and are on escarpments on plateaus. Fertaline soils are fine, have an abrupt increase in clay content, and are on fan remnants."
