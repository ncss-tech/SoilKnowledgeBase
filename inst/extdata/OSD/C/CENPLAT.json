  "OVERVIEW": "The Cenplat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over residuum from volcanic rock. Cenplat soils are on glacially scoured lava plateaus in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches (1346 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
