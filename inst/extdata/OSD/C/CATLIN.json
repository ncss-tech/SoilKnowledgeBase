  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Catlin soils are on relatively undissected loess covered till plains. Slopes typically are between 3 and 7 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent and are convex. Catlin soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy calcareous till. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.8 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches), frost free period ranges from 150 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 180 to 305 meters (590 to 1000 feet) above sea level."

The poorly drained Drummer soils and the somewhat poorly drained Flanagan soils are on lower lying parts of the landscape and form a drainage sequence with Catlin soils. The Plano and somewhat poorly drained Elburn soils are on adjacent or nearby outwash plains. Saybrook soils are on similar nearby landscapes where the loess mantle is thinner."

A perched seasonal high water table is 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material."
