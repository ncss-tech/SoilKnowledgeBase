  "OVERVIEW": "The Catlin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy calcareous till. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 890 mm (35 inches).",
