  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 46 through 102 centimeters (18 through 40 inches). Rock fragments are generally less than 10 percent by volume, but individual horizons range from 0 through 20 percent. Rock fragments are commonly fine gravel, but range through stone size. Surface stones and boulders are generally absent but range up through 3 percent of the surface of some pedons. The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid, except where it is limed.\nThe O horizon if present has hue 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 through 3. The O horizons typically have increased decomposition with depth and range from fibric through sapric material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 3. It is structureless or has weak medium granular structure and is very friable or loose. Texture ranges from loamy sand through coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have an Ap horizon up to 36 centimeters (14 inches) thick with similar colors and textures as the A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 3. Texture, structure and consistence have the same range as the A horizon.\nSome pedons have thin spodic horizons (Bhs or Bs) less than 5 centimeters thick. They have hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loamy sand through coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. In some rare instances, the texture may be coarse sandy loam.\nThe Bw and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. To a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches) the Bw horizon texture is loamy sand through coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Below 25 centimeters (10 inches) the texture is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. The upper part of the Bw horizon is single grain or has weak, very fine or fine granular structure and consistence is very friable or loose. The lower part is single grain and loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is mostly sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction but contains individual thin strata of fine sand or fine gravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Eastchop, Gosil, Plymouth, Rockbluff, and Schaffenaker series are in the same family. Eastchop soils are dominated by fine sands, they do not have coarse sand or loamy coarse sand textures in the solum. Gosil soils are from outside LRR R and S, they do not have coarse sand or loamy coarse sand within the series control section. Plymouth soils have higher rock fragments averages throughout the series control section. Rockbluff soils are from outside LRR R and S and have a paralithic contact within the series control section. Schaffenaker soils are from outside LRR R and are moderately deep to a lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carver soils are level through steep soils on pitted and dissected outwash plains and moraines. Slopes are dominantly 0 through 15 percent, but range to 45 percent. The soils formed in thick layers of coarse and very coarse sand that contain less than 20 percent rock fragments, most of which are fine gravel. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 through 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 through 1,270 millimeters (35 through 50 inches). Average frost-free period ranges from 120 through 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Deerfield, Eastchop, Plymouth, and Windsor soils are often on adjacent landscapes. Deerfield soils have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less within 100 centimeters (40 inches) of the mineral soil surface. Eastchop soils have more fine sands. Plymouth soils have greater rock fragment percentages.  Windsor soils have mixed mineralogy and more fine sands. The organic Freetown and Swansea soils and the very poorly drained Scarboro soils are in the kettleholes of the pitted outwash plains and the Gloucester and Montauk soils are intermingled on moraines. The Merrimac and Haven soils, which contain more silt, and the loamy Riverhead soils are on plains adjacent to the moraines. Carver is the excessively drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the moderately well drained Deerfield, poorly drained Massasoit and Mashpee soils, and the very poorly drained Rainberry soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. This soil was previously classified as siliceous, mesic Typic Udipsamments. Lab data indicates by far the majority of Carver soils have more than 90 percent minerals resistant to weathering. The classification is thus changed to reflect this condition.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) (A and E horizons).\nb. Sandy feature - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) averages about 85 percent sand.\nc. Albic horizon - 18 to 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches) (E horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
