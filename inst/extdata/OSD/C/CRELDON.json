  "OVERVIEW": "The Creldon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands that have fragipans at a depth of 18 to 35 inches.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess, colluvium, and the underlying loamy or clayey cherty residuum weathered from limestone.  Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan. Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent but dominantly are 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.",
