    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan is 18 to 35 inches. Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches.  Chert gravel and cobble content commonly is from 0 to 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons, but may range to 10 percent just above the fragipan.  Chert gravel and cobble content in and below the fragipan ranges from 0 to 75 percent with 0 to 15 percent larger than 3 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 56 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon, where present, has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less, with value of 4 or more in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon has mixed colors with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Low chroma iron depletions have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, and high chroma masses of iron accumulations having hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogues.  It is moderately acid to extremely acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. It is clay or silty clay or their gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or extremely cobbly analogues.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 43 inches."
