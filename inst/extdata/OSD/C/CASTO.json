  "OVERVIEW": "The Casto series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old gravelly alluvium from andesite, quartzite, shale, and possibly diorite.  Casto soils are on rolling to steep old alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 8 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
