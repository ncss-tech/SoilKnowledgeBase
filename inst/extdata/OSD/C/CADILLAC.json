  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 or more inches thick.  Depth to soft limestone is 70 or more inches below the surface.  Limestone boulders are on the surface and within the solum of many pedons, comprising about 1 to 3 percent of the soil area.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and E horizons and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Bt and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Color with chroma 2 is from uncoated sand grains and not an indication of wetness.  Some pedons have thin lamellae in the lower portion.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow and brown range from none to common.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nIn some pedons, the Bt horizon is underlain by limestone at a depth of more than 70 inches.  The limestone can be dug with light power equipment such as a backhoe."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cadillac soils are on uplands of peninsular Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments overlying limestone.  A few small limestone boulders and sinkholes occur in the landscape.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arredondo, Apopka, Candler, Jonesville, and Pedro series.  Apopka and Arredondo soils are on similar positions and are Ultisols.  The excessively drained Candler soils are on similar to higher positions and are sandy throughout.  Jonesville soils are on similar positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick, and are moderately deep to limestone.  Pedro soils are on similar positions and are shallow to limestone bedrock."
