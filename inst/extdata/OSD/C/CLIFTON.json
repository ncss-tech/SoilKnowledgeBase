Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, except where surface layers have been limed. Content of flakes of mica is few or common throughout Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 Where value is 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick. The A horizon is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Appomattox, Braddock, Buffstat, Christian, Clover (T), Danripple (T), Flagspring (T), Howell, Totier, Unison, Warminster, and Yellowbottom (T) series. Appomattox soils have a mantle of colluvium over residuum at least 3 feet thick. Braddock and Unison soils formed in colluvium or old alluvium on toe  slopes, fans, and high stream terraces. Buffstat soils formed in residuum from fine grained metamorphic rocks and contain a high amount of silt. Christian soils formed in residuum from interbedded limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale and contain fragments of these rocks. Clover soils formed in residuum from Triassic materials and contain fragments of these rocks. Danripple soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces and have a seasonal high water table between 40 and 60 inches. Flagspring and Yellowbottom soils do not have an official series description at this time. Howell soils formed in unconsolidated sediments containing diatomaceous earth and/or glauconite. Totier and Warminster soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clifton soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes of intermountain hills and low mountains of the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Elevations range from 1,400 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are typically between 8 and 30 percent but range from 2 to 50 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from intermediate and mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks high in ferromagnesium minerals such as hornblende gneiss and amphibolite. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 60 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Braddock and Unison series, these are the Bandana, Brevard, Chandler, Cowee, Evard, Fannin, French, Huntdale, Micaville, Saunook, and Wataugaseries. Bandana and French soils some what poorly drained and are on narrow floodplains. Brevard and Saunook soils formed in colluvium or alluvium on toe  slopes, benches, and fans are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Chandler, Cowee, Evard, Fannin, Huntdale, and Micaville, soils  are on uplands. Chandler, Micaville, Fannin, and Watauga soils are in a micaceous and paramicaceous mineralogy class, respectively. Cowee and Evard soils are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Huntdale and Saunook soils are in a fine-loamy particle-size class, have a thick dark surface horizon with value 3 or less.  Huntdale soils are on side slopes of cooler, north to east aspects."
