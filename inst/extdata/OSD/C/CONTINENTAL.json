The first modern type location and series description dated 9-71 was found to be in a fine-loamy family.  A second location and series description dated 3-83 was found to have an abrupt textural change and within the range of an existing series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL S68AZ023001 S68AZ023002\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
