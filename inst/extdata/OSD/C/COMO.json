  "OVERVIEW": "The Como series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from coarse grained igneous and sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
