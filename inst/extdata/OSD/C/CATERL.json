  "OVERVIEW": "The Caterl series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered dominantly from basalt and other igneous rock types. Caterl soils occur on summits, back slopes, foot slopes and toe slopes of mountains. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. with an O horizon present. The solum has hue of 10YR to 5YR. The particle-size control section has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCl-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried), with 15 to 30 percent clay content by field estimates, and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to fractured bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. It is weakly or moderately smeary.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. Texture is gravelly medial silt loam, gravelly medial loam, very gravelly medial loam or very cobbly medial loam with 12 to 25 percent clay. It has 15 to 45 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent stones. It is extremely acid to slightly acid. Organic matter is 5 to 10 percent. In some pedons, A2 and A3 horizons are present. Texture is gravelly medial silt loam, gravelly medial loam, very gravelly medial loam or very cobbly medial loam with 15 to 45 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is medial silt loam, medial loam, or medial clay loam with 15 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. It is 12 to 30 percent clay. In some areas the apparent clay content is 35 to 40 percent below 40 inches. It is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon or BC horizon, when present, has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It is 12 to 30 percent clay. It is extremely gravelly medial silt loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, extremely cobbly medial loam or extremely cobbly medial clay loam. This horizon has 60 to 80 percent rock fragments of which 30 to 70 percent are gravel, 0 to 30 percent are cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent are stones. In some areas, this horizon is glacial till derived from volcanic rocks."

The soils typically formed in colluvium weathered from basalt or other igneous and volcanic rock types but in some areas formed in glacial till from volcanic rock. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 130 inches. The average July temperature is 58 to 60 degrees F. and the average January temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.

Giveout soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Murtip soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Romanose soils are 10 to 20 inches to a lithic contact. Sach soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size class (medial over loamy-skeletal) and are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact."
