  "OVERVIEW": "The Carracas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale. Carracas soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is approximately 6.1 degrees C.",
