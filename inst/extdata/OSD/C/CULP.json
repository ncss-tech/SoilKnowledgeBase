Pebbles throughout the pedon range from few to common and some pedons have a few pebbles on the surface that\nrange up to about 2 inches in size.\nThe A horizon ranges up to 14 inches thick and has dry colors of\ndark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3; 3/3).  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and the horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nAverage clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon\nranges from 35 to 50 percent.  The lower Bt horizons are clay,\nsandy clay loam, or clay loam and they are mildly or moderately alkaline.  Few to common hard concretions and soft masses of\ncalcium carbonate are in the lower B2t horizons, mainly below a\ndepth of 40 inches.\nThe B21t horizon has base colors of very dark gray (10YR 3/1),\ndark gray (10YR 4/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2), and dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) with mottling of reddish yellow (5YR 6/6), dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2), reddish brown (5YR 4/3), dark brown (7.5YR 4/2), brown (7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3), and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).  This horizon is clay, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and ranges from neutral\nthrough moderately alkaline.  The matrix of the B22t horizon is\nolive (5Y 4/3), dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), brown (10YR 5/3), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) with many to common coarse mottles of red, yellow, gray, and brown.  The B23t horizon has common to many medium to coarse\nmottles of olive, brown, yellow, or gray.\nThe B3ca horizon is mottled olive, yellow, gray, or brown.\nThe C horizon is mottled brown, yellow, gray, and olive.
