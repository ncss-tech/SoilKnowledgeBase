  "OVERVIEW": "The Charlevoix series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy loam till on end moraines, drumlins, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
