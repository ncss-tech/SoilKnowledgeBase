  "BYREV": "Rev. RJV-DBO-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "04/2007",
  "STATES": "IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Churchtown series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 60 to 120 centimeters of loamy sediments derived from loess and sandy bedrock residuum and in the underlying loess.  These soils are on plane to convex upland side slopes and foot slopes.  Slope ranges from 6 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters.",
