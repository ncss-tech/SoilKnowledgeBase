  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carrwash (NV), Chemwash (CA), Descent (CA), Goldenhills (CA), and Rizzo (CA) series. Carrwash and Chemwash soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter (fine) gravel. Chemwash and Rizzo soils have mean annual soil temperatures that average greater than 25 degrees C, do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, and are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year. Descent soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 percent or greater throughout the profile without a diagnostic calcic horizon and are dominated by channers and flagstones. Goldenhills soils are formed in colluvium and residuum, have a surface C horizon with more than 80 percent rock cover, and are deep to a lithic contact."

The soils formed in mixed igneous alluvium. Elevations are -82 to 793 meters (-270 to 2,600 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 175 millimeters (3 to 7 inches); mean January temperature is 12 degrees C (53 degrees F); mean July temperature is 35 degrees C (95 degrees F); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Bristolake soils are on nearby fan skirts and lower fan aprons, have a sandy particle size control section and are slightly saline with an SAR of 5 to 13 in the control section. Clegorpass and Heleweiser soils are on nearby fan remnants and have loamy-skeletal particle size control sections. In addition, Clegorpass soils have an argillic horizon and Heleweiser soils have a calcic horizon. Pintobasin soils are on similar landscape positions and are sandy throughout the particle size control section. Riverbend soils are on more stable landforms and have a calcic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location was relocated in 2006 to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, California to better represent the series concept. The series has been overused throughout the Southwestern deserts including areas with precipitation ranging from 2 to 12 inches. Soils with extreme aridic moisture regimes should consider using the Rizzo series proposed for use in the Lower Colorado Desert (MLRA 31) with a moisture control section that is typically dry throughout for most of the year. New series should be proposed for the high precipitation zones. Use in MLRA 40 should also be reevaluated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from a depth of 0 to 18 centimeters (A and part of the C horizons).\nParticle size control section - the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (part of the C horizon).\nRevised for the correlation of SDJR - MLRA 30 - Carrizo-Riverwash complex 3 to 8 percent slopes, 03/13, LJG2\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
