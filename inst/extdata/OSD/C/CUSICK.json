    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. These soils are usually saturated from November through April. Depth to the water table in the winter and early spring is ponded to 2 feet. The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry, 2 or 3 moist. The structure is moderate angular blocky or moderate prismatic. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. Texture is siltyclay or silty clay loam above 50 inches, but ranges to very fine sandy loam below 50 inches."

Elevations are 2,000 to 2,200 feet. The climate has warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 27 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 100 days."
