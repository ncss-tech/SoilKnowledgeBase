These soils are usually saturated from November through April. Depth to the water table in the winter and early spring is ponded to 2 feet. The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry, 2 or 3 moist. The structure is moderate angular blocky or moderate prismatic. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. Texture is siltyclay or silty clay loam above 50 inches, but ranges to very fine sandy loam below 50 inches."
