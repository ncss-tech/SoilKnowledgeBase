  "OVERVIEW": "The Copenhagen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in consolidated ash and tuffaceous limestone influenced by loess.  Copenhagen soils are on mountain sideslopes and toeslopes and have slopes of 12 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
