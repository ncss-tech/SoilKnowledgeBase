This soil formed in alluvium from consolidated volcanic ash  and tuffaceous limestone with some influence from loess. Average annual  precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. Average annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. Average annual summer air temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F. Frost-free period is about 70 to 95 days."
