  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "MEB/RLR",
  "REVDATE": "06/2016",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Counterfeit series consists of very deep soils that formed from human transported material (HTM) which originated from material weathered from calcareous sedimentary rocks. Counterfeit soils are on man-made terraces and risers with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent on treads and up to 65 percent on risers. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C.",
