  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to firm till is 12 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Content of coarse fragments by volume in the upper friable layer is 5 to 20 percent for gravel and 2 to 20 percent for stones and boulders. Some cobbles are included. Coarse fragments in the firm till ranges from 15 to 35 percent of mostly gravel but includes some cobbles and stones. Fragments primarily are of igneous origin, but some are of metamorphic origin. Textures of the A, E and Bw horizons are loam, silt loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam and gravelly coarse sandy loam. Some pedons have stony modifiers. The solum ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6. Some pedons have a thin Bs horizon in the upper part with value and chroma of 3.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has firm or very firm consistence and weak or moderate platy structure which is a feature of dense till. It is restrictive to root penetration but not as restrictive as the Cd horizon. It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe BCd horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils typically are on bedrock controlled ground moraines with slightly concave slopes, but in some places they are on plane to slightly convex slopes. They are mostly midslopes in concave areas on the ridges. Slope gradients are 2 to 35 percent. They formed in noncalcareous, gravelly sandy loam glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age. This till is 20 to 40 inches thick and overlies bedrock, primarily granite and gabbro. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 30 inches."

Insula and Quetico soils have slightly convex slopes and are less than 20 inches to bedrock. Eveleth and Newfound soils are move that 40 inches deep to bedrock and are typically on footslopes and toeslopes but in some areas are also on midslopes."
