  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The soil is calcareous in all parts below 10 inches.  The A horizon is calcareous throughout in some pedons.  Typically the profile has 2 to 8 percent rock fragments.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 20 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nAn Oa horizon 4 to 6 inches thick is present when mapped as the depressional phase.  The texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically clay or silty clay but ranges to silty clay loam.   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin Bkss horizon below 16 inches.  Distinct slickensides and cracks filled with A material are present.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has common or many faint to prominent redoximorphic features. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It typically is clay, but in some pedons it is clay loam, silty clay, clay, and silty clay loam below a depth of 36 inches.   The Cg is absent in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clearwater soils have flat or slightly concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent on lake plains.  These soils formed in clayey, calcareous till of the late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 28 inches with 80 to 85 percent accumulating in April to October.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 140.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1300 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boash, Espelie, Hilaire, Reis and Wyandotte soils.  The Boash soils have fine-loamy substratum within the control section.  Espelie soils have a sandy mantle.  Hilaire soils are moderately well drained, have a sandy mantle, and are on higher lying areas.  Reis soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface and are on slight rises.  The Wyandotte soils have sandy-skeletal 2C horizons."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained and very poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow or very slow.  Some areas are subject to rare flooding.  Permeability is moderate or slow in the upper part and slow in the lower part.  Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time between April and June in most years in undrained areas.  Depressional areas have an apparent high water rable as high as +1.0 to 0.5 feet at some time during the year."
