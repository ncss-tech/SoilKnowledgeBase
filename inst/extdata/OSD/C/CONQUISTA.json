  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Conquista series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on gently sloping to steep uplands.  These soils are formed from loamy materials excavated during mining operations.  The original clayey topsoil surface layer was removed, stockpiled and replaced during the reclamation process.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature range is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation range is about 762 mm (30 in).",
