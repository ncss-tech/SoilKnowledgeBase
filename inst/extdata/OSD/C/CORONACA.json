  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 60 to more than 99 inches.  The soil is moderately acid to neutral throughout the profile.  Dark colored concretions and flakes of mica are in the A horizon of some pedons and are in the B horizon of most pedons.  Content of coarse fragments range to as much as 5 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and to as much as 10 percent in the lower part of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  The upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The lower part of the Bt horizon, below the series control section, has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in the lower part of the B2t horizon of most pedons.  The Bt horizon is clay.  Some pedons have thin horizons of clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, commonly with mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay."
