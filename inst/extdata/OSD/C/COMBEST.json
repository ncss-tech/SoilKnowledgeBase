  "OVERVIEW": "The Combest series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite bedrock.  Combest soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
