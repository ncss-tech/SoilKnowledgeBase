These soils are usually moist but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between 4 and 12 inches.  Base saturation of the upper part of the soil is estimated to range from 50 to 75 percent.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 through 4 moist.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam and is 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and a minor amount of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevation is 1,000 to 3,800 feet. These soils are in a continental climate of warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 190 to 220 days and the forst-free season is 150 to 185 days.."
