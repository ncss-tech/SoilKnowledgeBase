    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  Rock fragment range from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and\n0 to 30 percent in the substratum.  Rock fragments are less than\n10 inches in diameter.  Generally, they are fine pebbles, but\ncobbles can range to 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely\nacid to moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid\nto slightly acid in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an 0e or 0a horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2\nto 4 and chroma of 0 to 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy\nsand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to\n7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, coarse sand,\nor their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and\nchroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, coarse sand, or\ntheir gravelly analogs.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, very coarse sand,\nor their gravelly analogs.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of\n2 to 6.  Texture is coarse sand or very coarse sand, or their gravelly analogs.  Sand textures occur in some horizons up to 5 inches thick."

Abscota, Chute, Hodge and Sarpy soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.  Oakville, Plainfield and Windsor soils are dominantly sand or fine sand in the control section.  Penwood soils have hue\nof 5YR in the B horizon.  Dabney, Perks, Suncook and Westport\nsoils do not have B horizons.  Tyner soils have sola more than 36 inches thick.\nThe Adams, Carver, Colonie, Eastchop, Eastport, Grayling, Lakin, Ottokee, and Plymouth series are similar soils in related famil-\nies.  Adams, Eastport, and Grayling soils have frigid temperature regimes.  Colonie, Lakin and Ottokee soils have lamellae.  Carver, Eastchop, and Plymouth soils are formed in minerals resistant to weathering."

The soils formed in sand, coarse sand, and very coarse sand that contain less than 30 percent coarse fragments,\nmost of which are fine gravel.  Mean annual temperature ranges\nfrom 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches.  Average frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days."

The moderately well drained Deerfield soil, poorly drained Wareham\nsoils and very poorly drained Scarboro soil are in depressional\nareas in the landscape.  The well drained Occum, the moderately\nwell drained Pootatuck, and the poorly drained Rippowam soils are\non adjacent floodplains."
