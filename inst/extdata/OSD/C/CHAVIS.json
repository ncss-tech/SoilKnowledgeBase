Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native forest species such sweetgum, yellow poplar, shagbark hickory, American beech, and loblolly pine may be present."
