  "OVERVIEW": "The Cunningham series consists of well drained, deep, slowly permeable soils on uplands. These soils have brown loam A horizons, yellowish red clay and clay loam Bt horizons and C horizons of weathered shale. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Near the type location mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to weathered shale ranges from 30 to 56 inches. Depth to consolidated shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Reaction of all horizons ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, except where limed. Base saturation is more than 35 percent in the upper Bt horizon.  The content of shale fragments range from 0 to 12 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons, from 10 to 25 percent in the lower Bt horizon, and the BC horizons range up to 50 percent. The weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 40 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8. It is silt loam or loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 4, 5 or 6; and chroma of 6 or 8. It is sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay. The Bt2 horizon has the same colors as above horizon and mottles are none to common in shades of olive, yellow, brown and red. The BC horizon is mottled red, brown, yellow and olive. Texture of the Bt2 and BC horizons is clay, silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam with channery analogs.\nThe C horizon is mottled with hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. The Cr horizon is consolidated shale bedrock with colors same as horizon above. Some pedons have interbedded shale and sandstone."

Albertville, Carnasaw, Kirvin, and McQueen soils have sola more than 40 inches thick. Badin and Townley soils have Cr horizons within 40 inches of the surface. Catharpin soils have a lithological continuity. Bonwier and Urland soils formed from Coastal Plain sediments of Pleistocene Age. Coghill, Corryton, Luverne, and Marbledale (T) soils are very deep. Cuthbert soils have base saturation less than 35 percent in the upper Bt horizon. Masada, Nason, Tatum, Uwharrie, and Vance soils formed in materials weathered from crystalline rocks of the Piedmont. Mayodan and Peakin (T) soils formed in materials weathered from Triassic rocks. Additionally, Peakin soils have a perched water table 3 to 6 feet deep. Sweatman soils have mica flakes in the profile."
