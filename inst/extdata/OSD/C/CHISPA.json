  "OVERVIEW": "The Chispa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments of mixed origin.  These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on ridges and fans of broad plains and valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
