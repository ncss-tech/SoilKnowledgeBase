Pandale, Ratliff, and San Joh soils are moist in the sil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.  Laborcita soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments.  Kahn and Salado soils have less than 1 percent organic matter in the surface horizons.  Elfrida and Tuzigoot soils have textures that have less than 35 percent sand (silt loam, silt clay loam, clay loam, loam).  Tuzigoot sils have calcium carbonate concretions throughout."

The regolith consists of loamy sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free season ranges from 210 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 3,800 to 5,500 feet."
