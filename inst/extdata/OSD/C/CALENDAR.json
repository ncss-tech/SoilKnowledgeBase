  "OVERVIEW": "The Calendar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from shale.  Calendar soils are on hills and have slopes of 5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
