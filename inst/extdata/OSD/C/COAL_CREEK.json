    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mat of organic material ranges from 2 to 6 inches thick.  Matrix chromas of 2 or less and mottles are present within 20 inches of the surface.  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 9 to 21 inches.  Depth to the gravelly 2C horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, moist value of 2 or 3, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, moist value of 3 or 4, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottling and gley occur throughout.  Texture is silt loam with occasional thin stratas of fine sandy loam and silty clay loam.\nTexture of the 2C horizon is silt loam with few thin strata of sand, fine sandy loam, and silty clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 20 to 45 percent with 15 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobble."

Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Coal Creek soils formed in eolian and colluvial materials overlying glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 28 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is slow on lower slopes and medium on steeper slopes.  Seepage from higher areas keeps these soils wet.  Permeability is moderate in the surface horizons and moderately slow in the underlying material.  The soils on lower slopes near drainages are subject to flooding."
