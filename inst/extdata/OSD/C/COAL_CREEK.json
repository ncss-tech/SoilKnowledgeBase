  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Coal Creek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in eolian and colluvial materials overlying firm glacial till.  Coal Creek soils are in upland depressions and muskeg borders, often along the edges of drainages.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mat of organic material ranges from 2 to 6 inches thick.  Matrix chromas of 2 or less and mottles are present within 20 inches of the surface.  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 9 to 21 inches.  Depth to the gravelly 2C horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, moist value of 2 or 3, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, moist value of 3 or 4, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottling and gley occur throughout.  Texture is silt loam with occasional thin stratas of fine sandy loam and silty clay loam.\nTexture of the 2C horizon is silt loam with few thin strata of sand, fine sandy loam, and silty clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 20 to 45 percent with 15 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobble."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include: mottles and matrix chromas of 2 or less from 0 to 60 inches; a cryic temperature regime; an umbric epipedon from 0 to 9 inches; pH is 5.5  (1:1,H2O) or less throughout the profile; texture of the controlsection i  silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Coal Creek series formerly classified as coarse-silty.  Classification was revised based on the coarse fragment content of the substratum.  A different typical pedon is used due to the incomplete description of the original."
