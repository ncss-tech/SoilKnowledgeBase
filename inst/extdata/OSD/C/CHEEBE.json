    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The ochric epipedon is 6 to 13 inches thick.  The solum thickness is 30 to 45 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 72 to 75 degrees F.  The soils are dry 50 to 60 percent of the time where the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and 1 through 3 moist.  It is typically silty clay or clay but some are silty clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay.  It is 40 to 50 percent calcium carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry and 6 or 7 moist and chromas of 1 or 2.  It is mainly silty clay but ranges from silty clay loam to clay and has 40 to 50 percent calcium carbonates.  COMPETING SERIES:  There presently are no competing series in the family.  Series in similar families are the Bullion, Harding, Mellor and Manassa series.  Bullion, Harding, Mellor and Manassa all have less than 40 percent calcium carbonates in the series control section.  Bullion soils also have 5YR or redder.  Mellor has less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Manassa lacks a natric horizon."

They are formed in fine textured lake sediments that are derived mainly of limestone and calcareous shales and some sandstone and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,835 to 4,850 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool dry winters.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
