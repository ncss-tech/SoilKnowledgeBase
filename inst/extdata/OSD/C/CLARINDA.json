  "BYREV": "Rev. JAL-MRL-RJB",
  "REVDATE": "06/2015",
  "STATES": "IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarinda series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in a paleosol that formed in glacial till, with or without a thin layer of loess on the surface. These soils are on side slopes and head slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
