  "OVERVIEW": "The Chenoa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and the underlying calcareous till. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).",
