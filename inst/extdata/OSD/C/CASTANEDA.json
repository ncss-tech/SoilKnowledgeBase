  "OVERVIEW": "The Castaneda series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite.  Castaneda soils are on fan terraces with slopes of 1 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
