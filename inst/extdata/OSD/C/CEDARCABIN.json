  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarcabin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from fanglomerate, consisting of limestone, dolomite, and minor amounts of quartzite. Cedarcabin soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
