  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the continuous horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 12 to 36 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the shale and are mainly gravel.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A1 horizon if present has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or light clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent\nsilt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B3ca and Cca horizons have hue of 5YR through 10R.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR are present in some pedons.  These horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline and have 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from 3 to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chedsey soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in moderately thin medium to moderately fine or fine textured calcareous material weathered residually from calcareous red bed shales and loamstones.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
