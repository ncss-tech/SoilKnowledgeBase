  "OVERVIEW": "The Chedsey series consists of well drained soils formed in calcareous material weathered residually from calcareous red bed shale and loamstones.  Chedsey soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
