  "OVERVIEW": "The Cygnet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. These soils are on beach ridges and longshore bars on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
