    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bylas (AZ), Cline (AZ), Gotchell (AZ), Greyeagle (CA), Longjim (NV), Marsite (CA) and Tumarion (AZ). Bylas soils have late Neogene lacustrine limestone bedrock at 6 to 20 inches. Cline soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days from July through September and have basalt bedrock at 7 to 20 inches. Gotchell soils have fanglomerate bedrock at 15 to 60 inches. Greyeagle and Longjim soils are dry in the soil moisture control section during the summer months. Greyeagle soils have a 16 to 18 inches thick duripan forming on extremely stony loamy sand. Longjim soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to the duripan and contain less than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Marsite soils have rhyolitic bedrock at 6 to 20 inches. Tumarion soils have volcanic bedrock at  7 to 20 inches below a 2 to 15 inch thick duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crosgrain soils are on partial ballenas, ballenas and fan remnants. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,900 to 4,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

Irongold soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control-section and petrocalcic horizon. Nickel soils have a calcic horizon and no pan. Tenwell soils have a moderately deep duripan below a fine-loamy argillic horizon."
