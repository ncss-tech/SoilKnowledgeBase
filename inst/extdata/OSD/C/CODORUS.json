  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to sand and stratified material is more than 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet. Content of water rounded gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum, 0 to 25 percent in the C horizon above 40 inches and 0 to 70 percent in the C horizon below 40 inches. Mica flakes may be evident throughout the soil but quantities generally increase in the lower part of the solum and C horizon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures are loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 24 inches. Some pedons have a Bg horizon with chromas of 1 or 2 occurring in the lower part of the solum.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4, or is neutral. Fine-earth textures are loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. The C horizon of some pedons has layers of stratified sand and gravel below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Arkaqua soils are in the same family. They are limited to somewhat poorly drained, can have hues more yellow than 10YR in the solum and are formed in loamy alluvial sediments washed largely from soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss, schist, phyllite, and other metamorphic and crystalline rocks on nearly level flood plains along creeks and rivers in the Appalachian, Blue Ridge, and Great Smoky Mountains.\nChewacla, Congaree, Cartecay, Enoree, French, Philo, Rowland and Suches soils are in related families. Chewacla and Congaree soils have mean annual soil temperature warmer than 59 degrees F. Cartecay and Enoree soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. French soils have stratified sand and gravel that contain more than 35 percent by volume rock fragments ranging from 20 to 40 inches. Philo soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Rowland soils have cation-exchange activity classes superactive. Suches soils are semiactive, well or moderately well drained and located in the Blue Ridge Province."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Codorus soils are on nearly level slopes of floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in alluvial materials containing medium to large quantities of mica derived from schist, gneiss, phyllite and other metamorphic rocks. The climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 140 to 200 days."

Brandywine, Brecknock, Chester, Clymer, Edgemont, Gaila, Glenelg, Manor, Mount Airy, Neshaminy and Comus soils are all well drained. Glenville soils have a fragipan. Hatboro and Baile soils are poorly drained. Maggodee soils are coarse loamy and have an Oxyaquic subgroup."

Prior revision MAV 01/2006; 2007,2008 revision Pedon description updated as well as competing series list.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 30 inches (Bw horizon).\nc. Fluvaquentic feature - the organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth and the soil has redox depletions of chroma 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface.\nSIR- PA0015\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
