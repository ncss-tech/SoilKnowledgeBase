  "OVERVIEW": "The Carway series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderate over very slowly permeable soils. They are formed in loamy eolian sediments over a buried alluvial soil. These soils occur in interdunal depressions on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.",

Funmar and Taver soils are moderately well drained and are on higher positions surrounding the depressions. The well drained, coarse-loamy Hayes soils are on dunes. The well drained, sandy Pratt and Turon soils are on dunes. The well drained, fine-loamy Saltcreek soils are on dunes. Solvay soils are better drained and do not have a buried soil with 30 to 45 percent clay, and are on slightly higher positions."
