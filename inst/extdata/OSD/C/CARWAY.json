The Carbika soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine textured. They are on similar positions. The moderately well drained, sandy Dillhut soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on low dunes. Funmar and Taver soils are moderately well drained and are on higher positions surrounding the depressions. The well drained, coarse-loamy Hayes soils are on dunes. The well drained, sandy Pratt and Turon soils are on dunes. The well drained, fine-loamy Saltcreek soils are on dunes. Solvay soils are better drained and do not have a buried soil with 30 to 45 percent clay, and are on slightly higher positions."
