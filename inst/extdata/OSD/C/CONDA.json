The A horizon has total calcium carbonate of 70 to 85 percent.  The total clay is 40 to 65 percent of which 35 to 40 percent is carbonate clay.\nThe B and C horizons have total calcium carbonate of 85 to 100 percent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The description was drafter in 1969 but was not entered into the OSED file until 2003.  The series was inactivated in 2003.  Range of Characteristics were derived from the SCS-SOI-5 dated 8/90 (ID8825).\nThe series was previously classified as fine-loamy, mixed, calcareous.  Based on laboratory data from Idaho, the soil ranges from 76 percent CaCO3 in the surface to 99 percent in the C horizon.  After removal of the carbonate clay, the remaining clay values in the A horizon are 9, 7, and 8 percent respectively thus the change to coarse-loamy particle-size class and carbonatic mineralogy.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  University of Idaho, sample number 68-Ida-29-15.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
