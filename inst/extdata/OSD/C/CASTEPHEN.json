  "OVERVIEW": "The Castephen series consists of loamy soils that are shallow to a paralithic. These well drained soils formed in calcareous loamy residuum derived from interbedded chalk and marl. These gently to moderately sloping soils are on ridges on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 946.4 mm (37.3 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.3 degrees C (66.8 degrees F).",
