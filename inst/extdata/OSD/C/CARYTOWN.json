  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Some pedons have carbonate concretions and gypsum crystals in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Horizons having moist value lower than 3.5 are less than 6 inches thick.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Typically, this horizon is mottled with colors of lower value and higher chroma.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Either the coatings of the ped or the matrix of the Bt horizon has dominant chromas of 2 or less.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon average between 40 and 60 percent clay.  To a depth of about 36 inches, it ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline, and below this depth from neutral to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Similar series in other families are the Bonn, Huey, Lafe, McCrory, and Verdun soils.  Bonn, Huey, Lafe, McCrory, and Verdun soils have less clayey Bt horizons.  In addition, the Bonn, Lafe, McCrory, and Verdun have albic horizons that tongue or interfinger into the natric horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carytown soils are on upland or terrace flats and depressions.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The soils are formed in sodium rich medium and fine textured residuum from shale or old alluvium, colluvium, or loess.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Parsons, Gerald, Lanton, Summit, Creldon, and Keeno soils, all of which lack 15 percent sodium in any part of the argillic horizon and are acid in the lower part of the sola.  The Parsons, Gerald, Creldon, and Keeno soils are on higher positions.  Lanton soils are on flood plains.  Summit soils are on slopes either above or below the Carytown soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  More study is needed to determine if part or all of the argillic horizon has 15 percent sodium measured with ammonium acetate.  The upper part of the Bt horizon has 16 percent exchangeable sodium measured by ammonium acetate at pH 7.0.  The C horizon was measured by the same method and has 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  It is borderline to a Typic subgroup, but will not be changed with limited laboratory data and most areas have been mapped.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and E horizons); albic horizons the zone from approximately 9 to 15 inches (E horizon); natric horizon - the zone from approximately 15 to 48 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons); aquic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
