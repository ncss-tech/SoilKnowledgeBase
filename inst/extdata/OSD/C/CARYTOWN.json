  "OVERVIEW": "The Carytown series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that have very slow permeability and are formed in sodium rich, medium and fine textured residuum.  These soils are on the upland and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Some pedons have carbonate concretions and gypsum crystals in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Horizons having moist value lower than 3.5 are less than 6 inches thick.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Typically, this horizon is mottled with colors of lower value and higher chroma.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Either the coatings of the ped or the matrix of the Bt horizon has dominant chromas of 2 or less.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon average between 40 and 60 percent clay.  To a depth of about 36 inches, it ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline, and below this depth from neutral to strongly alkaline."

The Parsons, Gerald, Creldon, and Keeno soils are on higher positions.  Lanton soils are on flood plains.  Summit soils are on slopes either above or below the Carytown soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  More study is needed to determine if part or all of the argillic horizon has 15 percent sodium measured with ammonium acetate.  The upper part of the Bt horizon has 16 percent exchangeable sodium measured by ammonium acetate at pH 7.0.  The C horizon was measured by the same method and has 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  It is borderline to a Typic subgroup, but will not be changed with limited laboratory data and most areas have been mapped.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and E horizons); albic horizons the zone from approximately 9 to 15 inches (E horizon); natric horizon - the zone from approximately 15 to 48 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons); aquic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
