    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colburn soils are on low alluvial fans and terraces adjacent to flood plains at elevations of 2,075 to 2,300 feet. The slope range is 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from granitic and metasedimentary rocks with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. The average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 35 inches.  The frost-free season is about 90 to 120 days."

Mission soils have a fragipan and an argillic horizon. Odenson soils have high amounts of volcanic ash in the upper part. Selle soils are well drained and have base saturation less than 60 percent."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 29 inches with faint clay films present between 18 and 29 inches but assumed to lack the clay increase needed for an argillic horizon (Bwc1, Bwc2, and Bwc3, Bt, 2Btg1, and 2Btg2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bwc1, Bwc2, Bwc3, Bt, 2Btg1, 2Btg2 and part of the 2Cg1 horizon)\nAquic conditions and estimated redox depletions with chroma 2 or less - starting at 20 inches (2Btg1 horizon)\nThis pedon meets the requirements for a lamellic subgroup - the zone from 24 to 29 inches (2Btg1 horizon)\nAsh influence - the zone from 0 to 12 inches and assumed to be present based on associated soils and convention used in Idaho of Bir horizonation equating to ash material.\nClassification revised 11/01 from Aquic Xerochrepts to Aquic Dystroxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.  Classification revised 3/04 from coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Dystroxerepts to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquandic Dystroxerepts based on associated soils with ash influence and Bir convention.\nNote:  Further investigation needed as to the degree and depth of ash influence and whether andic soil properties are met.  This soil may possible meet Andisol criteria and isotic mineralogy.\nFurther investigation is needed to determine soil moisture regime concept based on vegetation documented. Vegetation listed suggests more of an aquic -  udic soil moisture regime and perhaps a Eutrudepts great group.\nThe 2/2009 revision reflects a change in great group from Dystroxerepts to Haploxerepts based on an evaluation of lab data on similar soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
