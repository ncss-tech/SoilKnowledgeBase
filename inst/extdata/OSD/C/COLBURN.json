  "OVERVIEW": "The Colburn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum. Colburn soils are on fans and low terraces adjacent to flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Classification revised 3/04 from coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Dystroxerepts to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquandic Dystroxerepts based on associated soils with ash influence and Bir convention.\nNote:  Further investigation needed as to the degree and depth of ash influence and whether andic soil properties are met.  This soil may possible meet Andisol criteria and isotic mineralogy.\nFurther investigation is needed to determine soil moisture regime concept based on vegetation documented. Vegetation listed suggests more of an aquic -  udic soil moisture regime and perhaps a Eutrudepts great group.\nThe 2/2009 revision reflects a change in great group from Dystroxerepts to Haploxerepts based on an evaluation of lab data on similar soils."
