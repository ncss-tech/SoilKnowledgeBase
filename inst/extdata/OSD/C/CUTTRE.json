    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 85 percent.  These soils have linear extensibility of 6 cm or more in the upper 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 6 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout.  Mudflow lenses or remnant discontinuous disoriented varves occur in individual horizons in some pedons.  Redox features occur in all layers between either the lower boundary of an Ap horizon or a depth of 10 inches below the mineral soil surface (whichever is deeper) and a depth of 16 inches.  Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches for some time in most years.  Cuttre soils react positively to alpha, alpha-dipyridyl at some time when the soil is saturated.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nCuttre soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both).  The E part has color like the E horizon described above.  Typically it is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay but in some pedons, it is silt loam or loam in the upper part.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Typically it is clay but subhorizons of silty clay are in some pedons.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 to 5.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color, texture, and reaction like the BC horizon described above."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.

The moderately well drained Amnicon soils, the well drained Miskoaki soils, and the poorly drained Bergland soils form a drainage sequence with Cuttre soils.  The moderately well drained Anton soils and the somewhat poorly drained Borea soils form a drainage sequence in areas adjacent to some Cuttre soils where there is stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits at 40 to 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Sedgwick soils are nearby where there is a loamy outwash mantle 10 to 24 inches thick over the clayey till."

Oats, timothy,  bromegrass, bluegrass, alfalfa, and trefoil are the principal crops.  Many areas which were formally cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, balsam poplar, quaking aspen, paper birch, bur oak, and willow.  Common understory plants are speckled alder, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
