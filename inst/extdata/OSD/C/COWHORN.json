  "REVDATE": "10/2005",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowhorn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments. They are on lacustrine plains, deltas, and river terraces. These soils have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 40 to more than 70 inches. An O horizon up to 3 inches thick is present in some pedons. The series control section has no rock fragments. The particle-size control section average ranges from 2 to 10 percent clay. Redoximorphic features consisting of Fe depletions and Fe concentrations occur within 16 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 1. In uncultivated areas, the A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral with value of 2. This horizon is loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR (mainly in the upper portion) and 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. In some pedons the lower parts have hue of 5Y. It typically has redoximorphic features with the greater contrast in the lower part of the horizon. It is loamy very fine sand or very fine sand. Some pedons have thin subhorizons of very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. In some pedons the B horizon lacks pipestems. It is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has many or common medium and large Fe concentrations. It is very fine sand or loamy very fine sand. Some pedons have thin strata of very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or fine sand. A few pedons have subhorizons of sand and coarse sand. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
