    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 34 to 38 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout. Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay, 20 to 45 percent silt and 35 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 25 to 50 percent pebbles and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  The soil ranges from slightly to strongly acid and has less than 50 percent base saturation throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has color similar to the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4."

Goodlow soils have clay ranging from 27 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Hossick soils have hues in the Bw and C horizon redder than 7.5YR.  Buell, Drakespeak, Grubstake, Moran, and McCall soils lack bedrock above 40 inches. Sibelia soils have a lithic contact between depths of 40 to 60 inches and Sibelia and Afley soils have stones dominating the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in residuum of basaltic materials at elevations above 10,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches, the majority of which falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 30 to 38 F."
