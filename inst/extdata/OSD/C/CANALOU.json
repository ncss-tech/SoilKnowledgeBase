  "OVERVIEW": "The Canalou series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium on level to nearly level or slightly undulating terraces or old natural levees. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness commonly ranges from about 36 to 60 inches.  The reaction in the Ap horizon and upper Bw horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The lower Bw horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid and the C horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Ap horizon and A horizon, if present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry colors have values of 5.5 or higher.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe upper Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It commonly has mottles of 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The lower Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottling is present with hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; values of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is sandy loam averaging from 8 to about 14 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3 or are neutral.  It is sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Similar series in other families are Bruno, Buncombe, Clana, Crevasse, Robinsonville, and Steele series.  Bruno, Buncombe, and Crevasse soils are sandy and lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 24 inches.  Clana soils are sandy throughout the control section. Robinsonville soils have an irregular decrease in content of organic carbon with depth and commonly lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 24 inches.  Steele soils are sandy over clayey."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canalou soils are on level to nearly level or slightly undulating terraces or old natural levees in the northern part of the Mississippi River Delta.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in sandy alluvium of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers under the influence of a fluctuating water table.  The lower part of the solum is saturated with water for short periods of time each year. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

Bosket and Broseley soils have argillic horizons and lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less and are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Farrenburg soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes.  Gideon and Sikeston soils are fine-loamy and are wetter. Lilbourn soils are grayer throughout.  These soils are in depressions or other lower areas that are wetter.  Malden and Scotco soils are sandy throughout the series control section and are on higher landscape positions."
