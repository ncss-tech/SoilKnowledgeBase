  "OVERVIEW": "The Crownest series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from hard, noncalcareous sandstone.  Crownest soils are on uplands in cold intermountain basins and mountain foothills and have slopes of 2 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Sandstone channers range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, channery sandy loam, or channery loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly channery sandy loam but may be sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or channery fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
