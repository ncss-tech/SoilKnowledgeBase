  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. MWH-STS",
  "REVDATE": "11/2013",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cadosia Series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in till and local colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. These soils are on glaciated uplands at elevations of 1000 through 1800 feet. Slope ranges from 15 through 70 percent. The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 through 72 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 20 through 75 percent in the solum and substratum, with greater than 35 percent weighted average between a depth of 10 and 40 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone with smaller amounts of shale and siltstone. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral and has value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 0 through 4. Dry color value is 4 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. The A horizon is less than 3 inches in some pedons on steeper slopes.  Most pedons have a thin organic surface layer.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5 YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine through coarse subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon commonly has hue, value, and chroma similar to the Bw horizon but the range includes 2.5Y. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak fine through coarse subangular blocky or platy or is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon above the bedrock that is deeper than 60 inches."

The Berks, Brownstown, Calvin, Judyville, Manlius, Matewan, Nailkeg, Peaks, and Sylco soils have bedrock within 40 inches. Blasdell and Wyoming soils formed in outwash. Brownsville, Cloverlick, Highsplint, and Jubin soils formed in residual or coluvium. Deadline soils have bedrock within 40 to 60 inches. Solon soils have bedrock within 20 to 60 inches. Lippitt and Keyesville soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Warwick soils formed in till dominated by slate and phyllite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cadosia soils are strongly sloping through very steep soils that typically occur in headslopes of hollows and lower side slopes of ridges and valley sides. Slope ranges from 15 through 70 percent. They formed in till and local colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 through 48 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 through 45 inches, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 110 through 150 days. The elevation ranges from 1000 feet through 1800 feet above sea level."

The Lordstown and Oquaga soils are both moderately deep to bedrock. The Bath and Mardin soils are nearby associates that have fragipans."
