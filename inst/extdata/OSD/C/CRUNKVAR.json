Sheeprock soils are calcareous throughout and are moderately to strongly alkaline.  Skaha soils have less than half of total rock fragments being 2 to 5 mm diameter and lack appreciable amounts of summer precipitation.  Wrango soils are slightly to moderately alkaline and average 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in control section with less than 50 percent of rock fragments being 2 to 5 millimeter in diameter."

Elevations are 2,015 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 cm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and part of the C1 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm  (C1 horizon and part of the C2 horizon).\nThe revision of December 2005 corrected the geographic coordinates in the type location section.  Future study of this series is needed to determine the amount of volcanic ash influence in the A horizons.  Based on lab data from adjacent soils there is a strong possibility that volcanic glass contents in the A horizons are much greater than 30 percent.  This would allow the series to classify in the subgroup of Vitrandic Torriorthents.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
