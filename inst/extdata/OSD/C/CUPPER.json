The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.   The upper 14 to 19 inches of the particle-size control section is silt loam with estimated clay content of 5 to 15 percent, 25 to 40 percent phosphate retention, 0.4 to 0.8 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 30 to 50 glass and less than 12 percent 15-bar water based on an air-dried sample.  The depth to the loamy buried soil material is 20 to 40 inches.  The amount of coarse fragment is 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has subangular blocky or moderate thin or medium platy structure that breaks to weak or moderate fine granular.\nThe AC and C horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.\nThe 2B horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  Faint clay films may be present in some pedons.  The 2Bk horizon is slightly or strongly effervescent and has 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Soil reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Exfo soils are very shallow and are sandy-skeletal.  Ninetysix soils are loamy-skeletal and lack vitrandic properties.  Hack soils are fine-loamy and are usually found in complex with Cupper soils on fans and broad ridgetops.  Patron soils are on adjacent north slopes and are in the fine family.  Prill soils are on adjacent south slopes, are in the fine family, and are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Ritter soils are coarse-loamy and are usually found in complex with Cupper soils on fans."
