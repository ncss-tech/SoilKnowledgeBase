  "OVERVIEW": "The Cathcart series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial drift, volcanic ash, sandstone, and siltstone.  Cathcart soils are on foothill back slopes and toe slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Cathcart soils are usually moist, but they are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The particle-size control section contains a weighted average of 0 to 15 percent unweathered rock fragments.  The lower part is 10 to 60 percent weathered rock fragments and 0 to 5 percent hard rock fragments.  The 15-bar water on air-dried samples is 12 to 15 percent.  It is assumed the 15-bar water on moist samples is above 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist, 1 through 6 dry.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  In forested, undisturbed areas some pedons have an E horizons less than 1 inch thick.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry.  It is medial sandy loam, medial fine sandy loam, medial loam, or medial silt loam.  This horizon has subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 7 moist or dry.  It is medial loam, medial sandy loam, medial clay loam, gravelly medial loam, or gravelly medial sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches, most of which falls between October and April.

Indianola soils are sandy.  Kitsap and Quilcene soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  McKenna and Norma soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Nati soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are on ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches and a cambic horizon from 8 to 35 inches, and estimated andic properties throughout.  The bulk density is assumed to be between 0.85 to 1.00 in much of the particle-size control section.  Need to evaluate the features that were called mottles and later change to redox concentrations.  The soil is called well drained with redox at 25 inches.  Based on the morphology the subgroup should be Aquic, yet no water table is described.  Should assume the red colors are litho-chromatic from the weathering of the sandstone and siltstone."
