  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chime soils are on plateaus and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone with some influence from alluvium, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is mainly 200 to 250 mm but ranges up to 360 mm in parts of northeastern California.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is mainly 90 to 120 days but ranges down to 60 days in parts of northeastern California."
