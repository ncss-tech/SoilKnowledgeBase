These soils formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone with some influence from alluvium, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.

The mean annual precipitation is mainly 200 to 250 mm but ranges up to 360 mm in parts of northeastern California.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is mainly 90 to 120 days but ranges down to 60 days in parts of northeastern California."
