    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact is 44 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches and includes the entire argillic horizon.  The upper 5 to 9 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 20 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 40 to 75 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the A horizon and 3 to 4 percent in the AB horizon.  Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 12 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of l or 2 dry or moist.  It is loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 3 percent stones, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 10 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe AB horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 3 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The 2Bt1 is clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 0 to 3 percent stones, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, and 25 to 35 percent gravel.  The 2Bt2 is clay or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 3 percent stones, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 25 to 40 percent gravel."

In addition, Ateron and Harlow soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and Canest soils are dry for more than 100 consecutive days.  Chen, Douhide, and Graley soils have aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regimes.  Chen and Wallsburg soils have A horizons with less than 7 percent volcanic glass and less than 3 percent organic matter.  Itca soils lack mollic colors throughout the Bt horizon, and have A horizons with less than 7 percent volcanic glass and less than 3 percent organic matter."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Camool soils are on rolling hill or north-facing hillslopes and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and tuff mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 3,400 to 5,400 feet.  The climate can be characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  Mean January temperature is 24 degrees F. and mean July temperature is 67 degrees F. Mean annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."
