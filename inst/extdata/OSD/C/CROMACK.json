  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 13 to 30 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 6 inches, with the depth to accumulations of carbonates as masses or threads ranging from 12 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has been leached and is noncalcareous in some pedons.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 4 to 14 percent.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 5 to 14 percent, but some discontinuous strata may exceed 14 percent in some pedons.  EC ranges from 0 to 8 mmhos/cm.  ESP ranges from 2 to 13 percent.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with properties similar to the Bk horizon, except for the accumulation of carbonates.\nThe Cr horizon is soft calcareous shale that can be interbedded with sandstone or siltstone."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches with over half falling in April, May and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September and October.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
