  "OVERVIEW": "The Coldspring series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone.  Coldspring soils are on mountain plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
