  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Coppler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on kames, moraines, stream terraces, and outwash channels. These soils formed in sandy and loamy outwash underlain by stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
