Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches."

Alonzville, Coursey, and Ingledove soils contain more clay and are on similar landscapes. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Gladehill, Gullion, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils have mollic epipedons and are on flood plains. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on flood plains. Elevasil, Silverhill, and Zanoni soils have an active CEC class. Botetourt soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have fragipans and are on similar landscapes. Shottower soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on high terraces."

The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 5/89\nADDITIONAL DATA: Morphological, chemical, textural, and mineralogical data are reported in:\nEdmonds, W. J., D. D. Rector, D. A. Gall, D. R. Hatch, R. S. Joslyn, and J. C. Baker. 1987. Properties and classification of soils derived from stratified alluvium in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia.
