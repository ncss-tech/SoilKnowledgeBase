    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 35 inches thick and is more than 1/3 the thickness of the solum over bedrock.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The rock fragments in the particle size control section average 35 to 75 percent.  The soil has a mean annual soil temperature of about 38 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 50 to 54 degrees F.\nThe A and B/A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt (argillic) horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is gravelly to extremely gravelly, cobbly to extremely cobbly clay loam and clay with about 35 to 45 percent clay.  Fine distinct manganese concretions in the Bt horizon range from none to common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Castino soils are on moderately steep to steep hills and mountains at elevations of 8,300 to 10,000 feet.  Some Castino soils are on gently rolling basalt lava flows.  Slope gradients are 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum on intermediate volcanic rocks and basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 50 to 65 days.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F."

Hoodle soils are over 40 inches in depth to bedrock and have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons.  Tica soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.
