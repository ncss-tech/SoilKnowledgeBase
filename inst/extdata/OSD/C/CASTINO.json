  "OVERVIEW": "The Castino series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in colluvium and residuum on intermediate volcanic rocks and basalt.  Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The rock fragments in the particle size control section average 35 to 75 percent.  The soil has a mean annual soil temperature of about 38 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 50 to 54 degrees F.\nThe A and B/A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt (argillic) horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is gravelly to extremely gravelly, cobbly to extremely cobbly clay loam and clay with about 35 to 45 percent clay.  Fine distinct manganese concretions in the Bt horizon range from none to common."
