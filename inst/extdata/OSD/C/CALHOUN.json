  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Calcium-magnesium ratios are 1 or more in most horizons.  Sand content is less than 10 percent in the upper 60 inches of the solum.  The glossic horizon extends deeply into the B horizon.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  In at least one subhorizon within a depth of 30 inches, exchangeable aluminum makes up 20 to 70 percent of the effective cation-exchange capacity.  Common fine brown and black concretions are throughout the solum in most pedons, but are not diagnostic.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid, unless limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through extremely acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles, in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from common to many.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 22 to 35 percent.  Reaction is typically strongly acid to extremely acid but ranges through neutral in the lower part of some pedons.  Fine veins of black staining (manganese-oxide) are on surfaces of peds in the B horizon of some pedons.\nThe BC and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline through extremely acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basile, Fountain, Frost, Gilbert, and Leton series in the same family and the Amagon, Caddo, Crowley, Foley, Guyton, Henry, Lafe, Routon, Wrightsville, and Zachary series.  Amagon soils lack tonguing of the E horizon into the B horizon and contain more than 15 percent sand.  Basile and Leton soils have more than 10 percent sand. Caddo soils contain more than 15 percent sand and mineralogy is siliceous.  Crowley soils have finer textures and an abrupt textural change from the A to the B horizon.  Foley soils are more alkaline and have a natric horizon.  Fountain soils have mildly to moderately alkaline B horizons.  Frost soils have B horizons that have peds coated with dark gray or black.  Gilbert soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the lower B horizon.  Guyton soils have more than 10 percent sand.  Henry soils have fragipans and the horizon of maximum clay content is below depths of 36 inches.  Lafe soils are browner and have a natric horizon.  Routon soils lack a glossic horizon.  Zachary soils have an abrupt textural change from the A to B horizon.  Wrightsville soils have finer textures in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calhoun soils are dominantly on nearly level areas and depressions on Pleistocene terraces, and less commonly on flood plains.  The soil formed from loess or loess-like material more than 5 feet thick.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 45 to 55 inches."
