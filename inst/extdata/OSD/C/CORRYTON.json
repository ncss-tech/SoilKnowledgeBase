  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The bedrock is typically weathered shale, but some pedons have layers of hard limestone interbeds.  Content of shale channers or gravels ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bt horizons, and from 0 to 50 percent in BC and C horizons.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid, except where the soil has been limed or limestone strata are present.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The texture of the fine earth is loam, silt loam, or, where eroded, clay loam.\nA BA or AB horizon is present in most pedons.  It has colors and textures similar to the Ap or upper Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles, if present, are in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray.  Texture of the fine earth is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is profusely mottled.  Mottles, if present, are in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray.  Evidence of relict rock structure can be identified in most pedons.  Texture of the fine earth is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is profusely mottled or thinly banded in these colors.  Mottles, if present, are in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray.  The C horizon is highly weathered shale bedrock having relict rock structure that can easily be rubbed to clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are currently the Albertville, Badin, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Coghill, Luverne, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Peakin,  Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, Uwharrie, and Vance series.  Soils in related families include the Fluvanna, Mattaponi, Noah, and Williamsville series.  Albertville, Carnasaw, Fluvanna, and Noah soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Badin and Townley soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 24 to 50 inches of alluvium over residuum.  Coghill soils formed in sandstone or interbedded sandstone and shale, and have a higher sand content in the subsoil.  Luverne soils contain mica flakes.  Masada soils contain mica flakes, coarse fragments of quartz, quartzite, gneiss or schist.  Mattaponi soils formed in Coastal Plain sediments.  Mayodan and Peakin soils formed in residuum from Triassic materials in the Southern Piedmont.  McQueen soils formed in fluvial sediments and are on stream terraces.  Nason soils have 25 to 50 inch sola and contain quartz and schist fragments.  Sweatman soils contain mica flakes.  Tatum soils contain schist fragments and have a paralithic contact with weathered schist.  Uwharrie soils formed in residuum from slate, phyllite, or sericite schist in the Southern Piedmont.  Vance soils have C horizons of saprolite weathered from felsic crystalline rock.  More competitors will become apparent as more series are reclassified."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Corryton soils are on broad ridges and side slopes in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys (MLRA 128).  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 800 to 1200 feet.  Corryton soils formed in residuum weathered from Cambrian and Ordovician aged shales, sometimes interbedded with thin seams of limestone.  The Moccasin formation and the Ottosee, Martinsburg, and Conasauga Shales are commonly associated formations near the type location.  Estimated mean annual temperature is  57.2 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about  57 inches."

Nonaburg soils have shale bedrock at depths between 8 and 20 inches.  Steadman soils are on adjacent low stream terraces and flood plains, have a lower clay content in the subsoil, and are moderately well drained."

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were mapped in the Sequoia series in older soil surveys of Knox and McMinn Counties, TN.  Sequoia soils are less than 40 inches deep to shale bedrock, and are now classified in the mesic temperature regime.\nMineralogy, particle size, and activity class are based on data from 8 representative pedons from Knox and McMinn Counties, TN.  The University of Tennessee soil characterization laboratory processed the samples.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - zone from 0 to 13 inches (A and BA horizons).\nArgillic Horizon - zone from 13 to 43 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
