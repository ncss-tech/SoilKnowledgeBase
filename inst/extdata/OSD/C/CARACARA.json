  "OVERVIEW": "The Caracara series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium from conglomerate.  Caracara soils are on pediments and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
