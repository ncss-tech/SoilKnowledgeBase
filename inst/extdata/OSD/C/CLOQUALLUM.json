  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 24 to 38 inches thick.  Faint to strong mottles occur below depth of 24 inches.  The soils are very strongly to extremely acid and acidity increases with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 51 degrees F.  Thin stratified layers of very fine sandy loam to silty clay are common in the profile.  The control section ranges from 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and 10YR dry, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR moist, and 10YR or 2.5Y dry, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Mottles are faint to prominent.  This horizon is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and has thin layers of silty clay or very fine sandy loam."
