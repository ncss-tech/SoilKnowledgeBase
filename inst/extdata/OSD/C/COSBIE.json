  "OVERVIEW": "The Cosbie series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in drainageways on a lava plateau. These soils formed in grassy organic material over diatomaceous earth over alluvium from pumice over alluvium from basalt. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
