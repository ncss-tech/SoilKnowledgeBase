  "REVDATE": "06/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Childers series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium colluvium and residuum from volcanic and sedimentary formations.  Childers soils are on mesas and plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
