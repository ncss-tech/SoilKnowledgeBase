  "OVERVIEW": "The Chistochina series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial drift.  Chistochina soils are on drumlins, moraines and undulating glacial till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F. Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 1 to 4 inches.  Thickness of the loess cap is 3 to 15 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 4 to 11 inches.  Texture in the control section includes sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand with a weighted average of less than 50 percent very fine sand.  The soil is slightly acid in the solum and neutral to mildly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent with 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe 2Bw horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture includes sandy loam and fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent with 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe 3C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral; moist value of 2, 3, or 4; and moist chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Textures include loamy fine sand, fine sand, and sand.  Pockets of fine sandy loam and loam are common.  Dark colors are due to the high concentration of black sand grains.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent with 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."
