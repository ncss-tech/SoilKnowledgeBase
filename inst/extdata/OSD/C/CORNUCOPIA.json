  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the clayey till, and depth to the stratified substratum all range from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel and cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nThe E horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nCornucopia soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nThe Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay but in some pedons it is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or sandy clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically clay but subhorizons of silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5. and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is stratified.  Individual strata are mostly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand or fine sand, but a few thin strata of finer texture are in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has color and texture like the 2Bk horizon described above.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Ck horizon that has colors and textures similar to the 2Bk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cornucopia soils are on knolls and side slopes on till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in clayey till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action over stratified loamy and/or sandy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1100 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Portwing, Herbster, Eaglebay, Manistee, and Odanah soils.  The moderately well drained Portwing and somewhat poorly drained Herbster soils form a drainage sequence with Cornucopia soils.  The moderately well drained Eaglebay soils are nearby where there is a loamy outwash mantle 10 to 24 inches thick over the clayey till.  Manistee soils are nearby and slightly upslope, and have 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash over clay.  Odanah soils have greater than 60 inches of clay, and occur adjacent to some Cornucopia soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow in the clayey deposits and moderate to rapid in the stratified lacustrine deposits. Saturation may occur above the clayey till at a depth of about 1 foot for brief periods after snowmelt or after high rainfall events. Saturation is for less than 3 consecutive days or 10 cumulative days per year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover are the principal crops.  Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, eastern white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch and red oak.  Common understory plants are beaked hazelnut, red-osier dogwood, black snakeroot, big-leaved aster, wild sarsaparilla, sweet coltsfoot and bracken fern."
