  "OVERVIEW": "The Coonhollow series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from basalt.  Coonhollow soils are on convex sideslopes on basalt plateaus in volcanic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, (762 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
