  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  Thin flat, limestone and shale fragments from 1 to 15 inches across ranges from 0 to 40 percent in the A horizon and from 5 to 45 percent in the B and C horizons.  The weighted average of coarse fragments in the particle size control section is less than 35 percent.  Fragments are commonly channery or flaggy.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4; some pedons have A1 horizons less than 4 inches thick with color value less than 3.5; texture of the fine earth is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium, granular or subangular blocky.\nWhere present, the AB or BA horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Thickness ranges from 0 to 6 inches.   Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay or clay; structure is weak to strong, very fine to medium, angular blocky; some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or olive.\nWhere present, C horizons 3 to 10 inches thick, have matrix and mottle colors in shades of brown, olive, or gray.  Texture of the fine earth in silty clay or clay."
