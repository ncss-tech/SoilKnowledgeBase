  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 28 to 58 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel and channers, range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the soil, but are commonly absent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4, with value of 4 or 5 restricted to Ap horizons. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular, subangular blocky or angular blocky. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe Eg or Bg horizon, where present, has hue of  10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Faces of peds have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 0 to 2 above 30 inches, and 0 to 4 below 30 inches. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Structure is weak to strong, medium to very coarse prismatic, or medium to coarse, angular blocky or subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Structure is weak, coarse or very coarse, prismatic, angular blocky or subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay. Some pedons may have strata of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canadice soils are on broad concave flats and depressions on Wisconsinan age lake plains, slackwater terraces and valley floors. These soils formed dominantly in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. In some areas the lake sediments are underlain by Wisconsinan age till substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 570 to 1,300 feet msl. The climate is humid temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 46 inches. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F. The mean growing season ranges from 110 to 198 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caneadea, Canadaigua, Fonda, Lorain, Rhinebeck, Stanhope (T), Teel, Wallkill, Wayland and Wick (T)soils. The somewhat poorly drained Caneadea soils on higher landscape positions and the very poorly drained Lorain soils on lower landscape positions are in a toposequence with Canadice soils. The Canadaigua and Fonda soils have mollic epipedons and are on lower landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Rhinebeck soils are on higher landscape positions. The Stanhope (T), Teel, Wallkill, Wayland and Wick (T) soils are coarser textured and are on nearby flood plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Permeability is moderate to moderately slow in the surface and very slow in the subsoil and substratum. Depth to an intermittent apparent water table is +0.5 to 1.0 foot from November to June in normal years. Frequent brief ponding occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and spring snowmelt."
