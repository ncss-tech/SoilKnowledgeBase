  "STATES": "NY,OH,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canadice series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed dominantly in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on Wisconsinan age lake plains, slackwater terraces and valley floors. Permeability is very slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

Rock fragments, mainly gravel and channers, range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the soil, but are commonly absent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4, with value of 4 or 5 restricted to Ap horizons. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular, subangular blocky or angular blocky. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe Eg or Bg horizon, where present, has hue of  10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Faces of peds have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 0 to 2 above 30 inches, and 0 to 4 below 30 inches. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Structure is weak to strong, medium to very coarse prismatic, or medium to coarse, angular blocky or subangular blocky.

Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Structure is weak, coarse or very coarse, prismatic, angular blocky or subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay. Some pedons may have strata of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canadice soils are on broad concave flats and depressions on Wisconsinan age lake plains, slackwater terraces and valley floors. These soils formed dominantly in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. In some areas the lake sediments are underlain by Wisconsinan age till substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 570 to 1,300 feet msl. The climate is humid temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 46 inches. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F. The mean growing season ranges from 110 to 198 days."

The somewhat poorly drained Caneadea soils on higher landscape positions and the very poorly drained Lorain soils on lower landscape positions are in a toposequence with Canadice soils. The Canadaigua and Fonda soils have mollic epipedons and are on lower landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Rhinebeck soils are on higher landscape positions. The Stanhope (T), Teel, Wallkill, Wayland and Wick (T) soils are coarser textured and are on nearby flood plains."

Permeability is moderate to moderately slow in the surface and very slow in the subsoil and substratum. Depth to an intermittent apparent water table is +0.5 to 1.0 foot from November to June in normal years. Frequent brief ponding occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and spring snowmelt."
