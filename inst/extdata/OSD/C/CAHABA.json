  "OVERVIEW": "The Cahaba series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on nearly level to sloping large stream and river terraces in the Lower part of the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A. They formed in loamy and sandy alluvium.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

Apison and Euharlee soils have yellower subsoils and are on uplands in MLRA 128 (Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys) and Apison is moderately deep to soft shale. Biffle soils have yellower subsoils, are moderately deep to tripolite and are on uplands in MLRA 122 (Highland Rim and Pennyroyal). Durham and Granville soils have yellower subsoils and are on uplands of MLRA 136 (Southern Piedmont). Linker and Pirum soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on uplands of MLRA 119 (Ouachita Mountains). Murfreesboro soils have more than 5 percent gravel throughout the profile and are on similar positions in MLRA 133B (Western Coastal Plain). Nauvoo soils are deep and very deep to sandstone bedrock and are on uplands of MLRA 128. Pikecity soils have more than 15 percent gravel by volume in the control section and are in MLRA 135 (Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas Blackland Prairie). Pinoka soils are moderately deep to Triassic sandstone and siltstone and are on uplands of MLRA 136. Sipsey soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on uplands in MLRA 128. Stringtown soils have yellower subsoils and are on higher uplands in MLRA 133B. Suffolk soils have yellower subsoils are on higher adjacent positions."

Some areas of Cahaba soils in lower positions are occasionally flooded. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. They formed sandy and loamy fluviatile sediments that contained appreciable amounts of silt.  The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation of about 53 inches."

In addition, Annemaine and Craven are moderately well drained and Wahee soils are somewhat poorly drained. Bassfield and Latonia soils are on similar positions but have coarse-loamy control sections.  The moderately well drained Eunola and Tetotum soils are on slightly lower positions. The somewhat poorly drained Jedburg soils are on adjacent lower positions. Kalmia and Maxton soils are on similar positions but have a sandy C horizon within 40 inches of the surface. McQueen soils are on similar positions but have clayey control sections.  The poorly drained Myatt soils are on lower positions.  Wickham soils are on similar positions but have mixed mineralogy."
