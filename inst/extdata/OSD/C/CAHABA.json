Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe AB, A/B, B/A or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (A); or 4 or 5 (B). Chroma ranges from 2 to 4 (A) and 6 (B). Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe BE, B/E, E/B or EB horizon, where present, is a mix of the E and B horizons. It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma 6 or 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 5 to 8.  In some pedons, this horizon is mottled with shades of yellow and brown. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 6 or 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown and gray range from none to common.  Few to common flakes of mica may be present in the lower horizons.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Apison, Biffle, Durham, Euharlee, Granville, Linker, Murfreesboro, Nauvoo, Pikecity, Pinoka, Pirum, Sipsey, Stringtown and Suffolk series.  Apison and Euharlee soils have yellower subsoils and are on uplands in MLRA 128 (Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys) and Apison is moderately deep to soft shale. Biffle soils have yellower subsoils, are moderately deep to tripolite and are on uplands in MLRA 122 (Highland Rim and Pennyroyal). Durham and Granville soils have yellower subsoils and are on uplands of MLRA 136 (Southern Piedmont). Linker and Pirum soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on uplands of MLRA 119 (Ouachita Mountains). Murfreesboro soils have more than 5 percent gravel throughout the profile and are on similar positions in MLRA 133B (Western Coastal Plain). Nauvoo soils are deep and very deep to sandstone bedrock and are on uplands of MLRA 128. Pikecity soils have more than 15 percent gravel by volume in the control section and are in MLRA 135 (Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas Blackland Prairie). Pinoka soils are moderately deep to Triassic sandstone and siltstone and are on uplands of MLRA 136. Sipsey soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on uplands in MLRA 128. Stringtown soils have yellower subsoils and are on higher uplands in MLRA 133B. Suffolk soils have yellower subsoils are on higher adjacent positions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cahaba soils are on low terraces of large streams and rivers and are subject to rare flooding.  Some areas of Cahaba soils in lower positions are occasionally flooded. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. They formed sandy and loamy fluviatile sediments that contained appreciable amounts of silt.  The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation of about 53 inches."

Annemaine, Craven, and Wahee soils are on slightly lower positions and have clayey control sections.  In addition, Annemaine and Craven are moderately well drained and Wahee soils are somewhat poorly drained. Bassfield and Latonia soils are on similar positions but have coarse-loamy control sections.  The moderately well drained Eunola and Tetotum soils are on slightly lower positions. The somewhat poorly drained Jedburg soils are on adjacent lower positions. Kalmia and Maxton soils are on similar positions but have a sandy C horizon within 40 inches of the surface. McQueen soils are on similar positions but have clayey control sections.  The poorly drained Myatt soils are on lower positions.  Wickham soils are on similar positions but have mixed mineralogy."
