  "STATES": "CO,KS,NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canyon series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to weakly cemented limestone or very fine grain sandstone. These soils formed in loamy, calcareous residuum on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
