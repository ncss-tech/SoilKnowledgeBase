Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kizhuyak, Kodiak, and Salonie soils.  Kizhuyak soils consist of thick alluvial accumulations of volcanic ash.  Kodiak soils have a recent volcanic ash deposit at the surface, and dark reddish brown buried A horizons formed in older volcanic ash over glacial till.  Salonie soils have recent volcanic ash at the surface, and thin dark buried A horizons over alluvial gravel."

More data are needed to define the concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87).\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
