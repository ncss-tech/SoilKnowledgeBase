  "OVERVIEW": "The Carjo series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from tuff, sandstone and shale on hills, ridges, mesa tops and slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
