All these soils receive at least 250 millimeters (10 inches) of precipitation annually.  In addition, Betonnie, Terro, Terry and Vonalee soils are derived from sandstone. Terro and Terry soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm, 20 to 40 inches) to soft sandstone bedrock. Betonnie soils are 10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 inches) deep to the top of the argillic horizon. Bijou soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees C) and are 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 inches) deep to the top of the argillic horizon. Davishat soils are derived from sandstone and limestone and have visible secondary calcium carbonates starting at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) and a calcium carbonate equivalent in the substratum of 2 to 5 percent. Vonalee soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10.5 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F)."
