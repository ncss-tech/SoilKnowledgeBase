  "OVERVIEW": "The Caryville series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in interstratified sandy and loamy alluvium on flood plains and narrow stream terraces.  These soils have moderately rapid or rapid permeabilty.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam textures typically extend to depths of 12 to 20 inches but range from 10 to 24 inches.  Dominantly stratified sand and loamy sand with few thin laminae of fine gravel, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, and silt loam textures comprise the underlying deposits.  The average textural class of the 10 to 40 inch control section is loamy sand with clay content estimated to range from 5 to 10 percent.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the Ap, A, and AC horizon and from 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon.  The A and AC horizons are medium acid to neutral.  The 2C1 horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The 2C2 horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value and chroma of 2 or 3; with predominant color of dark brown (7.5YR 3/2).\nThe AC horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have high chroma mottles in the 2C horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Caryville series is the only member of this family.  Other soils in other families are Ankeny, Dickinson, Disco, Dunnville, Eudora, Farrar, Trempe, Velva, and Ware.  Ankeny and Disco soils have lower sand content and mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Dickinson and Farrar soils have lower sand content and a regular decrease in organic matter with depth and commonly have colors not as red.  Dunnville soils have a higher content of clay in the control section and organic matter content in the A horizon that decreases regularly with depth.  Eudora soils have colors not as red and contain less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand in the control section.  Trempe soils have sand A horizons.  Velva soils have lower sand content in their control section.  Ware soils have less sand in the upper part of the solum, are less acid, and have yellower hues in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  In addition, all these soils except Dunnville and Velva have mesic soil temperatures."

Concept of Caryville in Dunn County was established as the Dunnbot Series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Ap, A); other features - have an irregular decrease of organic carbon content with increasing depth and a content of 0.3 percent or less within 1.25 m of the surface."
