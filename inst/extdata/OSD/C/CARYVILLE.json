  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam textures typically extend to depths of 12 to 20 inches but range from 10 to 24 inches.  Dominantly stratified sand and loamy sand with few thin laminae of fine gravel, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, and silt loam textures comprise the underlying deposits.  The average textural class of the 10 to 40 inch control section is loamy sand with clay content estimated to range from 5 to 10 percent.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the Ap, A, and AC horizon and from 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon.  The A and AC horizons are medium acid to neutral.  The 2C1 horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The 2C2 horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value and chroma of 2 or 3; with predominant color of dark brown (7.5YR 3/2).\nThe AC horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have high chroma mottles in the 2C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Caryville series is the only member of this family.  Other soils in other families are Ankeny, Dickinson, Disco, Dunnville, Eudora, Farrar, Trempe, Velva, and Ware.  Ankeny and Disco soils have lower sand content and mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Dickinson and Farrar soils have lower sand content and a regular decrease in organic matter with depth and commonly have colors not as red.  Dunnville soils have a higher content of clay in the control section and organic matter content in the A horizon that decreases regularly with depth.  Eudora soils have colors not as red and contain less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand in the control section.  Trempe soils have sand A horizons.  Velva soils have lower sand content in their control section.  Ware soils have less sand in the upper part of the solum, are less acid, and have yellower hues in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  In addition, all these soils except Dunnville and Velva have mesic soil temperatures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caryville soils are on nearly level to gently undulating topography on flood plains and narrow stream terraces. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in sandy alluvium interstratified with thin layers of loamy alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches."
