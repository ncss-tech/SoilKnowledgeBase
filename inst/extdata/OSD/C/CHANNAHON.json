  "OVERVIEW": "The Channahon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy material overlying limestone or dolostone bedrock on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
