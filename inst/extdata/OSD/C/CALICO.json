  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The unconformable fine textured stratum is at depths of 20 to 30 inches and it is 14 to 30 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist for 6 months or more during the winter and spring months.  Iron mottles having hue of 2.5YR to 5BG and chromas of 2 or greater are common below a depth of 20 inches.  The organic matter content ranges from less than 0.70 in the A horizon to more than 2 percent in the IIC horizon.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  The soils are moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6).  The upper part of the control section is dominantly fine sandy loam with a weighted average of less than 18 percent clay; thin (less than 3 inches thick) strata of very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam or clay loam are in some pedons.  The upper part of the control section has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The lower part of the control section is dominantly silty clay or clay and has minor stratification with clay loam, silty clay loam or heavy silt loam in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  A few fine (less than 1/2 inch) very hard lime nodules occur below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Salt and gypsum crystals occur above the water table in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calico soils are on smooth, nearly level floodplains with gradients commonly less than 0.3 percent, but ranging up to 2 percent.  They formed in loamy alluvium deposited by flood waters over clayey alluvium.  The loamy alluvium was derived from mixed rock sources including assorted volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  The underlying clayey alluvium was derived from mixed sedimentary and reworked lacustrine deposits.  The climate is arid having a mean annual rainfall of 4 to 6 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.; the January temperature is about 65 degrees F.; and the July temperature is about 83 degrees F."

Native vegetation where not irrigated is quailbush, arrowweed, mesquite trees, fourwing saltbush, and saltgrass."
