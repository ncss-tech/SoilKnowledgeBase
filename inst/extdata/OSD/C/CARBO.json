  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, usually shale, limestone, or quartz, range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the A horizon and from 0 to 15 percent in the B and C horizons. Oxide concretions range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the solum, and some pedons have a few secondary carbonate concretions in the lower part of the B and C horizons.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the A horizon and from moderately acid through mildly alkaline in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Where value and chroma are 3 or less, it is less than 6 inches thick.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, and silty clay or clay in eroded areas.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Hue of 5YR is restricted to the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Mottles, streaks, or patches of colors are in some pedons.  The Bt horizon is clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The BC horizon is clay or silty clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons are mottled. The C horizon are clay or silty clay.\nThe R horizon is limestone or interbedded limestone and shale."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bardley, Chilhowie, Endcav, Gatewood, Niangua, and Oshkosh series.  Bardley soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout the B horizon.  Chilhowie soils have a thinner solum and contain more rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Endcav and Oshkosh soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Gatewood soils have rock fragments larger than 3 inches and have more rock fragments than the Carbo soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carbo soils are gently sloping to very steep upland soils in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  They formed in material weathered from argillaceous limestone and, in some areas, limestone interbedded with small amounts of shale.  Rock outcrops and/or sinkholes are in many areas.  Mean annual temperature range from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation range from 38 to 44 inches near the type location. Elevation ranges from 600 to 2,500 feet."

Faywood, Lodi, Muse, and Poplimento soils have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Lodi, and Muse soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Frederick, Oaklet, and Swimley soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Guernsey and Pagebrook soils are on lower parts of the landscape and are not as well drained. Opequon soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface."
