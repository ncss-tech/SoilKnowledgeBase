  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Catuna series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils. They formed in loamy and clayey residuum derived from mudstone of the Wilcox Group. These soils are on depressional areas on interfluves in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1,346 mm (53 in).",
