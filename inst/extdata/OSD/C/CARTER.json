The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches and extends into or through the Bt horizon.  Exchangeable sodium percentage in the Bt and C horizons ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam, but some pedons are clay loam.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a weakly expressed E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay averaging between 60 and 70 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay or silty clay.  It has few to common accumulation of carbonate and is slightly or moderately alkaline.   Some pedons have a Bkz or BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has 5Y or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay or silty clay.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate and salt crystals. It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Boro, Boyd, Lakoma, Millboro, Opal, and Promise soils are on nearby uplands. Erd soils are more poorly drained and do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  Hurley soils have a natric horizon. Millboro, Promise, and Witten soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  In addition, Millboro and Witten soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and Promise soils do not have an argillic horizon. Erd, Hurley, and Witten soils are on similar nearby landscapes.  Boyd, Lakoma, and Opal soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches."
