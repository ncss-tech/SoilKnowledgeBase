  "OVERVIEW": "The Castledale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks, dominantly sandstone and shale.  Castledale soils are on flood plains, stream terraces and valley floors.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
