    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ahsahka, Buckbay, Elkheights, Foehlin, Jauriga, Picketpin, Sagaser and Tweedy series. Ahsahka soils (MLRA 43) are very deep soils on benches, hills, canyon sideslopes and footslopes and do not have a paralithic contact. Buckbay soils (MLRA 21) are on hills and are formed in colluvium and residuum from andesite with mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F. and have color hue of 7.5YR or redder. Elkheights soils (MLRA 44) are very deep soils on hillslopes formed in loess and alluvium over glacial till. Foehlin soils (MLRA 5) are very deep soils on alluvial fans and low terraces and are formed in alluvium from metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic rocks. Jauriga soils (MLRA 21) are on mountain sideslopes and toeslopes and formed in material weathered from andesite or basalt and have mean annual soil temperature from 47 to 52 degrees F. Picketpin soils (MLRA 10) are on foothills,  do not have a paralithic contact, are very deep and have an E and B horizon with lamellae in the subsoil. Sagaser soils (MLRA 15) are on mountains and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Tweedy soils (MLRA 18, 26) are formed in material weathered from mica schist and igneous rocks and have color hue of 7.5YR or redder in B and C horizons."
