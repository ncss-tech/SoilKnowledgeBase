  "OVERVIEW": "The Crib series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Crib soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
