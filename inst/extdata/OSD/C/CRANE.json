  "OVERVIEW": "The Crane series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous gravelly and sandy outwash. The Crane soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly loamy outwash. They are on outwash plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
