  "OVERVIEW": "The Crinker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, glacial till, and colluvium and slope alluvium from phyllite.  Crinker soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and shoulder slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Hatchet soils are slightly acid or moderately acid in the spodic horizon and 60 to 90 percent andesitic pebbles and cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Howson and Polallie soils are 35 to 60 percent hard sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section and the fine earth fraction is sandy loam in the lower part. Kindy Ohanna, Vabus, and Waptus soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till. Springsteen soils lack organic coatings on faces of peds in the Bs horizon and have a mean annual soil temperature of 42 to 44 degrees F."

They formed in volcanic ash, glacial till, and colluvium and slope alluvium from phyllite.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 80 to 95 inches.  These soils have a marine climate with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers with snow cover from November to May.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F, and the average July temperature is 57 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

The Bhs horizon has more than 6 percent carbon but is less than 4 inches (10 cm) thick.  Laboratory data are available on this series. NSSL numbers 81P3101-3107.  Data supports revised classification.  The spodic horizon meets chemical criteria for a spodic horizon.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 1 inch, a spodic horizon from 1 inch to 20 inches, and a lithic contact at 32 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
