  "OVERVIEW": "The Cahoon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in outwash over till derived from granitic rocks. The Cahoon soils are on moraines and outwash plains of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
