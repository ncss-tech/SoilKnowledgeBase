Depth to hard fractured consolidated volcanic bedrock ranges from 14 to 41 inches.  Reaction is neutral throughout.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 12 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Content of rock fragments range from 5 to less than 35 percent, by volume. Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr layer is composed of hard fractured and moderately weathered serpentinite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated serpentinite bedrock."

They formed in residuum that weathered from serpentinite. The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 35 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 82 degrees F."

Bermeja (T) and Cerro Mariquita (T) soils are shallow to volcanic bedrock and have coarser textured profiles.  Costa (T) and Pitahaya (T) soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Esteli (T) soil is shallow to soft limestone and has coarser textured profiles."
