  "REVDATE": "03/1999",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crustown series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone.  Crustown soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
