  "REVDATE": "12/2008",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Costilla series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in wind-reworked sandy alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Costilla soils are on, alluvial fans, alluvial flats, valley side slopes and wind reworked portions of terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
