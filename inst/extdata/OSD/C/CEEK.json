  "OVERVIEW": "The Ceek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum both derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Ceek soils are on moderately steep to steep mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
