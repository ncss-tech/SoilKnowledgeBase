Soils that were competing series prior to the Seventh Edition of Soil Taxonomy (and may be reclassified to this family) are the Fishers, Ormiston, and Pleioville series.  Fishers soils do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates above 30 inches.  Ormiston soils have a calcic horizon.  Pleioville soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."
