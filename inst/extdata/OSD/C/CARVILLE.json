  "OVERVIEW": "The Carville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in recent loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping natural levee positions on flood plains, mainly along the Mississippi River and its distributaries. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The reaction class was also changed from nonacid to calcareous based on data from the type location and supporting pedons, and a study of other supporting sites in St. John the Baptist Parish. The type location pedon was sampled for full characterization analyses by NSSL, Lincoln, Ne. (S02-LA095-003).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon...... 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (Ap horizons)\nCambic horizon........ 15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 in) (Ap2 horizon)\nIrregular organic carbon decrease... 0 to 127 cm (0 to 50 in)(C and Cg horizons)\nFree carbonates.......0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in) (Ap, C1, and C2 horizons)\nAquic conditions......saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features (including chroma 2 matrix) within a depth of 51 cm (20 in).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
