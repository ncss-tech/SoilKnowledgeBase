    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carville soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping natural levee positions on flood plains along the Mississippi River and its distributaries. The soil formed in recent loamy alluvium. Most areas are protected from flooding by levees. The climate is humid temperate. Elevation ranges from 1 to 8 meters (3 to 25 ft) above mean sea level. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 18 to 24 degrees C (65 to 75 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 1397 to 1778 mm (55 to 70 in). Annual frost free days range from 235 to 350."

The soil is saturated in all layers below depths of 30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in) from December through June in normal years. It stays saturated within a depth of 76 cm (30in) for periods of up to 1 month duration in normal years. Flooding frequency ranges from none to common."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification was changed from a Fluvaquentic subgroup to a Fluventic subgroup in 2004 according to 9th ed. Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The reaction class was also changed from nonacid to calcareous based on data from the type location and supporting pedons, and a study of other supporting sites in St. John the Baptist Parish. The type location pedon was sampled for full characterization analyses by NSSL, Lincoln, Ne. (S02-LA095-003).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon...... 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (Ap horizons)\nCambic horizon........ 15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 in) (Ap2 horizon)\nIrregular organic carbon decrease... 0 to 127 cm (0 to 50 in)(C and Cg horizons)\nFree carbonates.......0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in) (Ap, C1, and C2 horizons)\nAquic conditions......saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features (including chroma 2 matrix) within a depth of 51 cm (20 in).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
