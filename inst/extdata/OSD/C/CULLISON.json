  "OVERVIEW": "The Cullison series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
