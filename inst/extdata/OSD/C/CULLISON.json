SICL texture added to the Bkg horizon\nRRH in 3/2007: All changed to metric. Introductory paragraph: revised. Typical pedon: revised, extended Ak horizon to include all of mollic epipedon. RIC's: revised including the O horizon: described ranges as in other horizons, Ak horizon: Textures: added mucky loam and mucky fine sandy loam. Geographic Setting through Distribution and Extent: revised. Geographically Associated Soils: Deleted Crowther, Els, Gannett, and Gus, added Elsmere and Nenzel. Additional Data: revised.\nRRH in 3/2009: Introductory paragraph and Geographic Setting: Changed slope range to 0 to 1 percent. Typical pedon: changed loam to mucky peat to agree with Oe horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs 89NE031036, 89NE031039, 89NE031040, and 91NE075001.
