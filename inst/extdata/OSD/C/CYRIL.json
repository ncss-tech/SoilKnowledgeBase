  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Texture throughout all horizons to a depth of 40 inches is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray (10YR 3/1), dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  The Ap horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline and some pedons are noncalcareous to 10 inches.\nThe Bwk horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown or dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 4/3, 5/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6).  It is calcareous with 1 to 5 percent films and soft bodies of calcium carbonate.\nThe BCk horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), reddish  yellow (7.5YR 6/6, 7/6), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or yellow (10YR 7/6).  This horizon is similar in texture to the control section but some pedons are stratified with coarser or finer strata below 40 inches and contains 2 to 8 percent films and bodies of calcium carbonate."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in the family.  Similar series are the Bippus, Bosque, Fife, Gageby, Gowen, Kaski, Plevna, Pocasset, Sweetwater, and Waldeck.  Bippus, Bosque, Fife, Gageby, Gowen, and Kaski soils average more than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch section.  Plevna soils contain no visible segregated lime, are noncalcareous between 10 and 20 inch depths and have characteristics associated with wetness.  Pocasset soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Sweetwater soils have a water table within 30 inches of the soil surface and have characteristics associated with wetness.  Waldeck soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have charactertisics associated with wetness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cyril soils are on nearly level flood plains of the eastern part of the central rolling red plains and central rolling red prairies.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loamy alluvium on flood plains that drain Permian and Pleistocene age sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 38 to 64.  Frost free days range from 210 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1500 feet."

Port soils are on adjacent areas and have fine-silty control sections.  Pulaski soils are on adjacent areas and are noncalcareous in the control section and are redder in color."
