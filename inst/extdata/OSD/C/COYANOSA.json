  "OVERVIEW": "The Coyanosa series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained soils that are moderately permeable above moderately slowly permeable sandstone bedrock.  These strongly sloping to very steep upland soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered predominantly from sandstone bedrock.  Outcrops of tilted, strongly cemented sandstone and large sandstone boulders are common.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 16 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 275 days and elevation ranges form 2,900 to 5,200 feet."

Boracho and Upton soils have petrocalcic horizons and are in similar positions.  Brewster soils have mollic epipedons and formed in igneous bedrock in mountains at higher elevations.  Ector soils formed in limestone bedrock, have a mollic epipedon and are in similar positions.  Hodgins and Reagan soils are deeper than 80 inches and are on lower, broad alluvial flats.  Sanderson soils are deeper than 80 inches and are along lower narrow drainageways and on foot slopes."
