  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coyanosa soils are on sloping to steep sandstone hills.  Slopes are mainly 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered predominantly from sandstone bedrock.  Outcrops of tilted, strongly cemented sandstone and large sandstone boulders are common.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 16 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 275 days and elevation ranges form 2,900 to 5,200 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boracho, Brewster, Ector, Hodgins, Reagan, Sanderson and Upton series.  Boracho and Upton soils have petrocalcic horizons and are in similar positions.  Brewster soils have mollic epipedons and formed in igneous bedrock in mountains at higher elevations.  Ector soils formed in limestone bedrock, have a mollic epipedon and are in similar positions.  Hodgins and Reagan soils are deeper than 80 inches and are on lower, broad alluvial flats.  Sanderson soils are deeper than 80 inches and are along lower narrow drainageways and on foot slopes."
