  "OVERVIEW": "The Colake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are in drainageways and closed depressions on glaciated uplands.  Slope is 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
