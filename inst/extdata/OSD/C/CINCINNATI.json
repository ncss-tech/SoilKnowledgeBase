  "OVERVIEW": "The Cincinnati series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. These soils formed in a mantle of loess, a thin layer of pedisediment, and a paleosol formed in the underlying till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Avonburg, Schaffer, and Westboro soils are somewhat poorly drained; Blanchester, Clermont and Cobbsfork soils are poorly drained; and Blocher, Jonesboro, Nabb, and Rossmoyne soils are moderately well drained. Blocher soils are on similar positions on the landform and are often part of a complex map unit that includes the Cincinnati soils. Bonnell soils are on dissected parts of the till plain and do not have a fragipan. Edenton, Jessup, and Loudon soils are on dissected parts of the till plain. The moderately deep Eden and shallow Fairmount soils are more clayey, and are on backslopes of hills underlain with interbedded shale and limestone."
