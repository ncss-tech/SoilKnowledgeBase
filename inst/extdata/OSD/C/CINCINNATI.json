  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cincinnati soils are on till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of loess 46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 inches) thick, a thin layer of pedisediment, and a paleosol formed in the underlying till. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 200 days. Elevation is 183 to 396 meters (600 to 1,300 feet) above mean sea level."

Avonburg, Schaffer, and Westboro soils are somewhat poorly drained; Blanchester, Clermont and Cobbsfork soils are poorly drained; and Blocher, Jonesboro, Nabb, and Rossmoyne soils are moderately well drained. Blocher soils are on similar positions on the landform and are often part of a complex map unit that includes the Cincinnati soils. Bonnell soils are on dissected parts of the till plain and do not have a fragipan. Edenton, Jessup, and Loudon soils are on dissected parts of the till plain. The moderately deep Eden and shallow Fairmount soils are more clayey, and are on backslopes of hills underlain with interbedded shale and limestone."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2 to 3 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low in and below the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and moderately slow or slow in and below the fragipan."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Much of the area of Cincinnati soils is used for growing cultivated crops, mainly corn, wheat, soybeans, tobacco, and forages, both grasses and legumes. A considerable percentage of the Cincinnati soils is used for pasture or woodland, or is idle. Native vegetation is deciduous mixed hardwoods, including oaks, hickory, tulip poplar, maple, and beech."
