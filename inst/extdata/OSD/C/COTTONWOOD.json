  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe original series concept included soils that are shallow to a paralithic contact with massive gypsum bedrock and soils that have a gypsic horizon mapped in a complex with the Acme series. In 1999, the series concept was revised and restricted to shallow or very shallow to massive gypsum bedrock on upland positions. This revision retains the Cottonwood series with the largest acreage of these soils. The soils mapped in lacustrine sediments that have a gypsic horizon, on nearly level to very gently sloping positions, in a complex with Acme soils will be included with the Childress series.\nEdited 01/2017 (RFG-ROG): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A horizons).\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A horizons).\nParalithic contact: The contact with weakly cemented gypsum bedrock is at 31 cm (12 in). (Cr horizon)\nLithic contact: The contact with strongly cemented gypsum bedrock is at 48 cm (19 in). (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: none\nTaxomomic Version: Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
