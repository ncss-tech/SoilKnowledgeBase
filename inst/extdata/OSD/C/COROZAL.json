    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The base saturation (by sum of cations) is below 35 percent throughout the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has color values of 3 or 4, with chromas of 4 in hues of 5YR or 7.5YR.\nThe Bt horizons have values of 4 or 5, with chromas of 4 to 8 in hues of 2.5YR or 5YR.  Structure ranges from strong to moderate, and clay films range from thick continuous to thin patchy. Percent by volume of saprolite in the lower Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 40. Organic matter in the upper 6 inches of the argillic is below the 1.5 percent level.\nThe BC horizon, where present has value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 or 6 in hues of 5YR.  This horizon lacks clay films and has 30 to 60 percent saprolite."

Cialitos, Daguey, Humatas, and Lares soils have more than 1.5 percent organic matter in the upper part of the argillic horizons.  The Consumo soils have Bt horizons less than 10 inches thick.   The Ingenio and Jagueyes soils are more weathered and have lower exchange capacities in the argillic horizon.  The Vega Alta soils have more than 10 percent plinthite by volume in the upper 60 inches of the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Corozal soils occur on gently to moderately sloping interfluves of strongly dissected low volcanic hills with slope gradients range from 2 to 12 percent.  These low hills occupy a transitional area between limestone and volcanic geologic formations.  The soil formed in moderately fine to fine textured residuum of highly weathered volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The annual rainfall ranges from 75 to 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is from 74 to 78 degrees F.  The variation between mean summer and mean winter soils temperatures at 20 inches is less than 9 degrees F."
