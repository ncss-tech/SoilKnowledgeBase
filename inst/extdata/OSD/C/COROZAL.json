Cialitos, Daguey, Humatas, and Lares soils have more than 1.5 percent organic matter in the upper part of the argillic horizons.  The Consumo soils have Bt horizons less than 10 inches thick.

These low hills occupy a transitional area between limestone and volcanic geologic formations.  The soil formed in moderately fine to fine textured residuum of highly weathered volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The annual rainfall ranges from 75 to 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is from 74 to 78 degrees F.  The variation between mean summer and mean winter soils temperatures at 20 inches is less than 9 degrees F."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was changed with the 4/91 draft from Clayey, mixed, isohyperthermic Aquic Tropudults to Clayey, mixed, isohyperthermic Aquic Haplohumults.  The previous OSED date was 2/86.\nThe Corozal series was formerly mapped with the Lares series in the Soil Survey of Puerto Rico.  The lower subsoil colors are characteristic of a well drained soil, but the upper subsoil has characteristics of a somewhat poorly drained soil.  This is due to a perched water table that persists during the rainy season.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 7 to 40 inches (Bt horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
