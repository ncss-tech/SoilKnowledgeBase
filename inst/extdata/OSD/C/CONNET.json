  "OVERVIEW": "The Connet series consists of shallow, well drained soils on foothills and canyonsides.  These soils formed in loess and colluvium and residuum from tuff, rhyolite, and basalt.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
