  "OVERVIEW": "The Canteen series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rock with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to weathered granitic rock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The volcanic ash mantle dominated by amorphous material is 7 to 14 inches thick, but there may be a component of volcanic ash in the solum to a depth of about 20 inches. The volcanic ash mantle has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 6 to 15 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent angular rock fragments. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 through 6 moist. It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or ashy fine sandy loam and may be gravelly. It is 0 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons. It is 5 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is gravelly in some pedons. It is 10 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

Aits soils are more than 60 inches deep and have a hard and firm silt loam, loam, or sandy loam 2B horizon in the lower part of the control section. Apex soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a densic contact with dense glacial till. Centralpeak, Leadpoint, Moscow, Ojibway, Osborn, and Volperie soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Moonville and Waits soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the control section. Aits, Moscow, Moso, and Ojibway soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Roslyn soils average 5 to 30 percent rounded and subrounded pebbles of mixed mineralogy in the particle-size control section and are more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction in the upper 7 to 14 inches of the profile."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rock, with a mantle of volcanic ash. Rock fragments and bedrock consist of granite, quartz monzonite, granodiorite, diorite, porphyritic rhyodacite, and granitic gneiss. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
