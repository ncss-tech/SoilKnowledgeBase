  "OVERVIEW": "The Cullius series consists of shallow, well drained soils on terraces and plateaus.  They formed in fine-textured colluvium over semiconsolidated sediments and welded tuff from the Deschutes Formation.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of or 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist.

Devnot soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, have a xeric moisture regime and lack the pumice ash in the surface. Deven soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Dunnlake soils lack the pumice ash in the surface.  Wylo soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F. and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
