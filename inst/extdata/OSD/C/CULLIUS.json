The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of or 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It contains 0 to 10 percent total rock fragments.

Devada soils lack the 2Crkq horizon above the lithic contact, have an abrupt A/B boundary and lack the pumice ash in the surface layers.  Devnot soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, have a xeric moisture regime and lack the pumice ash in the surface. Deven soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Dunnlake soils lack the pumice ash in the surface.  Wylo soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F. and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  Elevations range from 2500 to 3000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."
