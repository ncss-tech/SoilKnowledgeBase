    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between about 4 to 12 inches for 50 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to the substratum is typically greater than 60 inches, but is 40 to 60 inches in some pedons. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. There is an absolute increase in clay content of 15 to 30 percent between the Bw and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy loam, gravelly ashy silt loam or very gravelly ashy loam and has 10 to 45 percent gravel. Ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is 0 to 0.4 percent and volcanic glass content is 5 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon (E horizon in some pedons) has value of 2, 3 or 4 moist, 4, 5, or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam, gravelly loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It has 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is clay, gravelly silty clay or gravelly clay, has 45 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 2Btk horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 moist and dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is clay or silty clay, averaging 50 to 60 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel. It is slightly to strongly effervescent. The 2Ck horizon (BC horizon in some pedons), when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is clay loam silty clay loam, silt loam or very gravelly silty clay loam with 20 to 33 percent clay and 10 to 45 percent gravel. It is slightly to violently effervescent.
