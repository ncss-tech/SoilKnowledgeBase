  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiefrange series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Chiefrange soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
