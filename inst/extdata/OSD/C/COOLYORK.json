  "OVERVIEW": "The Coolyork series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chloritic schist, mudstone and sandstone.  Coolyork soils are on mountains and slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
