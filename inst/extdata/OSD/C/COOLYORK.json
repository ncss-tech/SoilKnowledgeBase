    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coolyork soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1200 meters. These soils are derived from chloritic schist, mudstone, and sandstone. Coolyork soils are on linear and concave positions on mountain slopes and in drainage areas, and often have hummocky relief. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2280 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 220 to 280 days."
