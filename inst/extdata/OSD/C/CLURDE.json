  "OVERVIEW": "The Clurde series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Clurde soils are on fan remnants, inset fans, and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
