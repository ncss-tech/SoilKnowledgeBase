  "OVERVIEW": "The Chew series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in reworked eolian material and residuum derived from limestone and sandstone. Chew soils are on hillslope shoulders and structural benches. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
