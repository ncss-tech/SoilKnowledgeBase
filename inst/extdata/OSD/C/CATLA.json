  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to densic material consisting of very compact glacial till is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 50 to 53 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 15 to 35 percent rock fragments that are dominantly pebbles and a few cobbles.  There is a perched water table at 0.5 to 1.5 feet from January to May (oxyaquic).\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chromas of 1 to 3.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly ashy loam, gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, or gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has subangular blocky or weak angular blocky structure.  This is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is dense glacial till that crushes to gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catla soils are on hills and till plains at elevations of 50 to 500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in dense, very compact glacial till or a mantle of ablation till over very compact lodgment till.  These soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F, average July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 230 to 260 days.  Frost-free season is 170 to 200 days."
