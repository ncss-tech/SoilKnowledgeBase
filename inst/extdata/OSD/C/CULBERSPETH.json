  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "JAC",
  "REVDATE": "07/2012",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Culberspeth series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from mixed but dominantly limestone sources. These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. (18 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm).",
