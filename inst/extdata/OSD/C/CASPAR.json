    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 3 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 and 26 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  Organic carbon content in the upper cubic meter of the soil ranges from 12 to 15 kg/m2.\nThe E horizon is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 8/1 or N 8/0.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2; 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2 or 7/1.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Clay content is 5 to 20 percent.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid (pH 4.2 to 5.0).\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6 or 7/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.  Distinct or faint mottles in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR with chromas of 6 or 8 occur in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  Textures are sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Subrounded nodule content (2-50mm in diameter) ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Reaction is extremely through strongly acid (pH 4.2 to 5.5).\nA C horizon is present in some pedons.  The C horizon is 10YR 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 6/6 or 6/8.  Moist color is 10YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6 or 5/8.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 3 to 35 percent.  Reaction is extremely through strongly acid (pH 4.2 to 5.5)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Caspar soils occur on marine terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 9 percent on the terrace tops with slopes of 9 to 50 percent occurring on the terrace shoulders and in drainageways that dissect the terraces.  Elevations are 100 to 1000 feet.  The soils formed in marine sediments.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 30 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (Albic horizon) -- the zone from 0 to 12 inches (E1, E2)\nArgillic horizon -- the zone from 12 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3)\nThe Empire series is broadly and vaguely defined and therefore difficult to compete with the Caspar series.  The Empire series as described in the Sonoma County report ranges from 30 to greater than 60 inches deep.  This range in depth is different from that given on the official series description (50 to 70 inches).  Empire mapped in Sonoma Co. has silty clay loam Bt horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available for Caspar Type Location pedon - UCD Soil Morphology Lab Sample No. 63-49-12x (Sonoma County) and for Caspar pedon # S80-CA-045-10-(1-9), NSSL sample # 802428 - 802436 (Mendocino County).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
