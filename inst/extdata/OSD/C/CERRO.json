  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cerro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, outwash or slide deposits. Cerro soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, outwash fans, landslides, mountain slopes and stream terraces. Slopes are from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
