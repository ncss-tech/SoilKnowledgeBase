  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 75 to 150 centimeters.  Carbonates are typically absent in the solum but are in some pedons at depths between 100 and 150 centimeters.  The mollic epipedon is more than 75 centimeters thick and generally extends into the Bw horizon.  The series control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay; individual subhorizons can have 36 to 40 percent clay.  Sand content of the series control section is less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Some pedons have buried A horizons below 50 centimeters.  Few to common (up to 20% of the matrix) high chroma redoximorphic features are at depths of 45 to 100 centimeters or more.\nThe A horizon typically has color value of 3 or 4 (2 or 3 moist) and chroma of 0 to 2.  The A horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral (pH 5.6 to 7.3).\nSome pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has slightly higher value and similar texture to the A and Cg horizons.  It is moderately acid to neutral (pH 5.6 to 7.3). Bw horizons not meeting the criteria to be part of the mollic epipedon are considered cambic subsurface horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 (3 to 6 moist) and chroma of 2 or less.  The Cg horizon is typically silty clay loam or silt loam.  Thin layers of silty clay to loam textures are in some pedons. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline (pH 6.1 to 8.4) depending on the presence of carbonates at depths below 100 centimeters."

These soils are all drier in the series control section during the growing season.  The Ackmen, Shell, Tobin soils do not have a Bw horizon.  Gabaldon, Roxbury and Vega soils are calcareous at depths less than 38 centimeters.  Muir soils have redoximorphic features at depths below 150 centimeters."
