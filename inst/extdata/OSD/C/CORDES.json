These soils formed in mixed alluvial material derived from granite, schist, basalt and related rock. The climate is semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 14 to 18 inches, a mean annual temperature of 50 degrees to 56 degrees F., an average temperature of 35 degrees to 40 degrees F., and an average July temperature of 72 degrees to 78 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 135 to 175 days."
