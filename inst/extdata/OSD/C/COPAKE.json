  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches and typically corresponds to the depth to sand and gravel. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 5 to 70 percent in the substratum. The weighted average in the substratum is more than 20 percent. Typically, 75 percent or more of the rock fragments is rounded gravel. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, strongly acid to neutral in the B horizon, and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon. At least one subhorizon of the B ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Depth to carbonates is greater than 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry value is 6 or more. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction and has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. The Bw horizon has weak granular or weak subangular blocky structure, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series currently in the same family.\nThe Agawam, Alton, Branford, Chenango, Groton, Hartford, Haven, Hero, Hoosic, Merrimac, Riverhead, Tunkhannock, Wappinger, and Warwick series are similar soils in related families. Agawam, Branford, Haven, and Riverhead soils have less than 60 percent base saturation. Alton, Chenango, Tunkhannock, and Warwick soils are loamy-skeletal. Groton and Hoosic soils are sandy-skeletal. Hartford and Merrimac soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Hero soils have redoximorphic depletions within a depth of 24 inches from the surface. Wappinger soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Copake soils are nearly level to very steep and are on outwash plains, terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in a loamy mantle over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial materials derived mainly from schist, limestone, gneiss, and dolomite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation commonly is 40 to 50 inches but the range includes 36 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

The excessively drained Groton, moderately well drained Hero, somewhat poorly and poorly drained Fredon, and very poorly drained Halsey soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Amenia, Dover, Farmington, Georgia, Mudgepond, Nellis, Pittsfield, and Stockbridge soils formed in till derived dominantly from limestone and are on nearby uplands. Hadley and Winooski soils are on flood plains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cultivated crops, hay, or pasture. Common crops are silage corn and grass-legume hay. Some areas are wooded or in community development. Common trees are red, white, and black oak, white pine, beech, black birch, sugar maple, and white ash. Gravel commonly is excavated from areas of these soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects a new typical pedon and general updating.  Cation exchange activity class placement was based upon a review of limited data and similar and associated soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (A and AB horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 31 inches (Bw horizons).\n3. Strongly contrasting particle-size classes - the weighted average of the control section is coarse-loamy above a depth of 31 inches and is sandy-skeletal below 31 inches with the coarse-loamy part containing less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and 2C1 horizons).\n4. Dystric Eutrudepts feature - the base saturation is greater than 60 percent in the 10 to 30 inch depth (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
