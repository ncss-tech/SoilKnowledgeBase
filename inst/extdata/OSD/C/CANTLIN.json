  "OVERVIEW": "The Cantlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy eolian or glaciofluvial sediments on outwash plains. These soils have rapid permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The series control section does not have rock fragments. The particle size control section averages more than 50 percent fine sand. Medium and coarser sand commonly make up less than 25 percent of the sand fraction and less than 15 percent of it is retained on the No. 40 sieve.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand or loamy sand. The reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw and BC horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value and chroma of 3 to 5. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand, but loamy sand in the upper part of the B horizon is within the range. The reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. Some pedons have reddish brown weakly cemented Fe concentrations.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand or sand. It is moderately acid or slightly acid."

This soil formed in deeply leached, gravel free, sands that are mostly of eolian or glaciofluvial in origin. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches. Frost free period is 90 to 150 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1600 feet."

Very poorly drained Markey soils are also associated."
