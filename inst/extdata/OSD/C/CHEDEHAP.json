  "OVERVIEW": "The Chedehap series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or glacial outwash with some eolian influence.  They are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part of the profile and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
