Bijorja, Briabbit, and Irrigon soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Deschutes and Vining are moderately deep to bedrock.  Haybourne soils do not have a zone of calcium carbonate accumulation."

Slopes range from 0 to about 20 percent.  The soils formed in eolian material overlying alluvium and glacial outwash.  The semiarid to arid climate has an average annual precipitation of 6 to 11 inches including that 1 to 3 feet of snowfall and an average freeze-free period of 100 to 160 days in Idaho and 150 to 210 days in Washington."
