  "OVERVIEW": "The Codley series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and sandstone.  Codley soils are on fan terraces and alluvial valleys.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

This soil is dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter and dry in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at a 20-inch depth is more than 41 degrees F.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, more commonly 25 to 35 percent."
