This soil is dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter and dry in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at a 20-inch depth is more than 41 degrees F.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, more commonly 25 to 35 percent."

Greenhalgh soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and have hue of 10YR or yellower.  Karde soils are in a mesic soil temperature regime."

Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The climate is semiarid with average annual precipitation ranging from 9 to 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is from 70 to 100 days."
