  "REVDATE": "7/98",
  "STATES": "VI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cramer series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in material weathered from extrusive igneous bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent.",

Reaction slightly acid or neutral in the A horizon and moderately acid or slightly acid in the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles in shades of brown range from none to common.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 10 to 60 percent, by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 and 4, chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 10 to 30 percent, by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of weathered igneous bedrock.\nThe R horizon is composed of unweathered igneous bedrock."

All of these soils are on similar positions of volcanic uplands.  Annaberg, Maho Bay, Southgate, and Victory soils have less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Southgate and Victory soils do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Dorothea, Fredriksdal, and Susannaberg soils have vermiculitic clay mineralogy. In addition, Dorothea soils are very deep to bedrock and are associated with the Louisenhoj geologic formation."
