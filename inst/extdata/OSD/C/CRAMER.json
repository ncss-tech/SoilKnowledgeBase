Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 76 to 82 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

All of these soils are on similar positions of volcanic uplands.  Annaberg, Maho Bay, Southgate, and Victory soils have less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Southgate and Victory soils do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Dorothea, Fredriksdal, and Susannaberg soils have vermiculitic clay mineralogy. In addition, Dorothea soils are very deep to bedrock and are associated with the Louisenhoj geologic formation."
