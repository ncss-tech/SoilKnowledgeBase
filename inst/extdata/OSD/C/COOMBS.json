  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 62 degrees F, and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 to 15 inches is usually dry from June 15 until October 15 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.\nRock fragments make up about 5 to 25 percent of the A and Bt horizons and 50 to 90 percent of the very gravelly C horizons.  Fragments consist mostly of 1/4 to 1 inches rounded pebbles with some ranging up to 3 inches.  The A horizon is massive and hard, has less than 1 percent organic matter in the surface 8 to 10 inches, or has value of 6 dry or 4 moist.\nThe Coombs soils have brown and pale brown, medium acid gravelly loam and clay loam A horizons, light brown strongly acid clay loam B2t horizons underlain by a strongly acid very gravelly substratum at a depth of 54 inches.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue and has value of 5 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is usually gravelly and is heavy loam, loam or clay loam and ha subangular blocky structure or is massive.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard and is medium or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 ro 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam in the upper part and heavy clay loam or clay in the lower part.  The upper 20 inches has about 28 to 35 percent clay.\nThe B2t horizon has subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  It is slightly hard or hard and is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon varies considerably in texture, thickness of horizons, and coarse fragments over short distances and some pedons are underlain by very weakly consolidated tuff."

Arbuckle and Auberry soils have over 75 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon.  Butte and Wisheylu soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Churn soils have 18 to 28 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon and have moist hue of 5YR in the B2t horizon.  Sierra soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Coombs soils are nearly level to gently sloping.  They are on gravelly terraces at elevations of 100 to 500 feet.  They formed in gravelly alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F, average January temperature about 47 degrees F and average July temperature about 67 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 220 to 260 days."
