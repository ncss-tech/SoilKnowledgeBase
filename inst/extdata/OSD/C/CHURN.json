The solum thickness is over 60 inches.  The soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days.\nThe Churn soils have light yellowish brown, strongly acid, gravelly loam A horizons and light yellowish brown grading to strong brown gravelly clay loam, moderately acid Bt horizons.  The C horizons where present are stratified gravelly alluvium.\nThe A horizon colors range from brown and yellowish brown to pale brown and light yellowish brown (7.5YR, 10YR) dry and dark grayish brown to dark yellowish brown and dark brown moist; textures range from loam to gravelly loam, structure from massive to weak granular and reaction from moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizons range in color from brown and strong brown to pale brown and light yellowish brown (7.5YR, 10YR) dry, and dark brown to reddish brown (7.5YR, 5YR) moist; in texture from gravelly heavy loam to clay loam, and in reaction from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizons, where present, usually are moderately acid, stratified and gravelly sandy loams and loams."

The Perkins soils have yellowish red, slightly acid heavy clay loam or clay Bt horizons.  The Pleasanton soils have grayish brown A horizons and brown neutral Bt horizons with more than 75 percent base saturation.   The Tehama soils have pale brown A horizons low in organic matter and light yellowish brown, slightly acid to neutral Bt horizons with more than 75 percent base saturation."

Underlying material is gravelly alluvium from various rocks.  Elevations range from 400 to 800 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 30 to 45 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, average January temperature about 45 degrees F, and average July temperature about 80 degrees F."
