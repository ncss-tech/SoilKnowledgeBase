The solum thickness is over 60 inches.  The soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days.\nThe Churn soils have light yellowish brown, strongly acid, gravelly loam A horizons and light yellowish brown grading to strong brown gravelly clay loam, moderately acid Bt horizons.  The C horizons where present are stratified gravelly alluvium.\nThe A horizon colors range from brown and yellowish brown to pale brown and light yellowish brown (7.5YR, 10YR) dry and dark grayish brown to dark yellowish brown and dark brown moist; textures range from loam to gravelly loam, structure from massive to weak granular and reaction from moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizons range in color from brown and strong brown to pale brown and light yellowish brown (7.5YR, 10YR) dry, and dark brown to reddish brown (7.5YR, 5YR) moist; in texture from gravelly heavy loam to clay loam, and in reaction from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizons, where present, usually are moderately acid, stratified and gravelly sandy loams and loams."
