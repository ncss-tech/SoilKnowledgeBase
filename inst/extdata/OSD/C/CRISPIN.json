  "OVERVIEW": "The Crispin series consists of moderately deep to consolidated marine sediments, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Crispin soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all part from July 1 to October 1 in most years.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2 or 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.

Inverness soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches and contain 5 to 20 percent mica flakes.  Ornbaun soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.

The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

Biaggi soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Flumeville and Windyhollow soils are often in subtle depressions.  Flumeville soils have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, and have a fine particle-size control section and a mollic epipedon.  Windyhollow soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches, and have a mollic epipedon.  Mallopass soils have mottles between 50 and 60 inches, and have a mollic epipedon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 inches (A, AB, Bt)\nArgillic horizon (minimal) - the zone from 14 to 23 inches (Bt)\nParalithic contact - the boundary at 23 inches.  The horizon is massive and very hard - it does not slake in water.  Can be dug with difficulty with backhoe or sharp shooter. Cementing agent unknown.\nMany areas now mapped as the Crispin series were mapped as Kneeland, Hardpan variant in the Soil Survey of the Mendocino County Bottomlands California, 1973."
