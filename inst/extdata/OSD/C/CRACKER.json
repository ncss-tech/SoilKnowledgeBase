The upper part of the A horizon has texture of clay, silty clay, or sandy clay loam, as well as the mucky analogues of these textures.  The lower parts of the A horizon have texture of sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is composed of sapric material.  Thickness of the Oa horizon is less than 1/2 the total thickness of the soil, or 8 inches, whichever is less. Texture is muck.\nA Cg horizon may occur below a depth of 10 inches in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, or olive.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."
