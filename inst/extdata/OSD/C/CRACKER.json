  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cracker series consists of shallow, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils in tidal marshes along the Gulf Coast of northern Florida.  They formed in clayey and loamy marine sediments over limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Total sulfur content is less than 0.75 percent, and n-values are less than 0.7 throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  The upper part of the A horizon has texture of clay, silty clay, or sandy clay loam, as well as the mucky analogues of these textures.  The lower parts of the A horizon have texture of sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is composed of sapric material.  Thickness of the Oa horizon is less than 1/2 the total thickness of the soil, or 8 inches, whichever is less. Texture is muck.\nA Cg horizon may occur below a depth of 10 inches in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, or olive.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."
