  "OVERVIEW": "The Carrbutte series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Carrbutte soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
