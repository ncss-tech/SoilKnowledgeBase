These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the solum and volcanic ash influence is 14 to 35 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.

Ardenvoir, Easte, and Noil soils are deep to a paralithic contact.  Jumpe soils have loam and silt loam fine-earth textures throughout the profile.  Seeburg soils have a mixed ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick and have 4 to 7 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Analulu, Blinn, Kamela, Brevco, Redpeak, Santop, and Thout soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Highhorn and Radarcreek soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Huntrock soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Jimbluff soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lekrem soils have 3 to 8 percent clay.  Longort soils have a Cd horizon.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Coxit soils are on backslopes of mountains at elevations of 4,200 to 5,300 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary rock with minor amounts of glacial till and a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 115 days."
