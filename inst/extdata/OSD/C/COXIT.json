  "OVERVIEW": "The Coxit series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary rock with minor amounts of glacial till and a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
