  "OVERVIEW": "The Calneva series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Calneva soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks such as andesite, basalt, and granodiorite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Low hummocks are a common microfeature on these soils.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 4,010 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
