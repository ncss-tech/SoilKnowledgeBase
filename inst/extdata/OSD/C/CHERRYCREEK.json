  "OVERVIEW": "The Cherrycreek series consists of deep, well drained soils on midslopes of plateaus and canyons. Cherrycreek soils formed in mixed ash and loess over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
