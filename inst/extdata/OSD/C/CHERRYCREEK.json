  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cherrycreek soils are on north-facing midslopes of plateaus and canyons, and on structural benches. Elevations are 2,800 to 6,200 feet. Slopes are 2 to 90 percent. The soil formed in mixed ash and loess over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 28 to 53 inches (Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons).\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 43 inches (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons).\nPachic feature - the zone from 0 to 28 inches qualifying as a mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for this pedon. Reference sample #S92OR-063-011 for Wallowa County, Oregon, NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 1/94.\nNote: Based on partial laboratory data, the A2 horizon, from 9 to 28 inches, meets isotic mineralogy criteria with NaF pH of 8.6 and 1500 kPa water to measured clay ratio of 1.1. It is assumed the Bw1 horizon also meets isotic criteria and therefore meets the thickness requirement for isotic mineralogy family.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
