  "OVERVIEW": "The Chemehuevi series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, schist, and gneiss. Chemehuevi soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (about 73 degrees F).",
