  "OVERVIEW": "The Cisco series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy materials derived from sandstone of Cretaceous age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to moderately sloping backslopes and footslopes of low ridges on hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
