  "OVERVIEW": "The Cinderfall series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over basaltic cinders. Cinderfall soils are on lava plains. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
