    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cavin, Crackedground, Nutzan, and Wildcatbutte series.\nCavin soils have soil reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid in the epipedon, do not have basaltic cinders in the lower part of the particle-size control section, and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Crackedground soils are deep to lithic contacts and are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section. Nutzan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Wildcatbutte soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section."
