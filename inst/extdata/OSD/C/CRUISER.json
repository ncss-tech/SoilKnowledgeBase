  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F, with an O horizon.  The soils are usually moist and dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Rock fragments range from 10 to 30 percent in the control section. Gravel and concretions typically make up the majority of the rock fragments in the upper part of the solum and gravel and cobbles in the lower part.  The particle-size control section has an estimated phosphate retention of more than 85 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent.  It has sodium fluoride pH of 9.5 to 10.5, and 15-bar moisture of 20 to 30 percent based on an air-dried sample.  Reaction ranges from moderately to very strongly acid.  Percent clay averages 20 to 30 percent within the control section.  Moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Depth to a moist chroma greater than 3.5 is less than 10 inches.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam. This horizon has moderate fine granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or loam. It has moderate or weak very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly clay loam, cobbly loam, or gravelly loam with some pedons having sandy loam in some parts.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cruiser soils are on uplands with slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 4,700 feet.  The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured colluvial material weathered from basic igneous rock with some additions of volcanic ash at least in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F; mean July temperature of 55 degrees F; mean January temperature of 31 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 140 inches.  The frost-free period is 70 to 130 days."
