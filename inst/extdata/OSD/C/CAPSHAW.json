  "STATES": "AL,GA,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Capshaw series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils on stream terraces, in depressions and on upland flats.  They formed in a thin layer of loess or old alluvium and in the underlying clayey residuum. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to limestone or interbedded limestone and calcareous shale bedrock ranges from 40 to about 80 inches.  Fragments of chert or gravel range from 0 to 10 percent in each horizon.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid in the Ap and Bt horizons and ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizon and the subhorizons just above bedrock.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or rarely loam.\nSome pedons have a BE transitional horizon with colors similar to the Bt horizon.  Texture is silt loam\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.   Below depths of 10 inches from its upper boundary there are few to many redox depletions of 2 or lower chroma, and most pedons have few to many yellowish red or red redox accumulations below that depth. In some pedons the Bt4 horizon is a combination of gray, brown, and yellow colors representing redox depletions and accumulations without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 to 4, or is neutral.  Redoximorphic features range from common to many in shades of yellow, brown, and gray or is a combination of these colors representing redox accumulations and depletions without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is commonly silty clay or clay and rarely silty clay loam."

Talbott and Bradyville soils have reddish subsoils and are well-drained soils on uplands.  Conasauga, Colbert, Lyerly, and Mimosa soils are on footslopes and hillsides.  Byler soils are on stream terraces and have a fragipan.  Tupelo soils are in slightly lower terrace positions and are somewhat poorly drained.  Egam and Arrington  soils have mollic epipedons and are on floodplains."
