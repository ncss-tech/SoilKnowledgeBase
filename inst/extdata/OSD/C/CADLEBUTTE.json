  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist  but are dry in the moisture control section for 70 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 7 to 12 inches.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 25 to 40 inches.  There is an absolute clay increase of 15 to 25 percent between the AB and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry,  and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 5 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content is 15 to 30 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay loam and contains 5 to 30 percent gravel and cobbles.  Clay content is 33 to 55 percent decreasing with depth."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Lickskillet and Searles soils are loamy-skeletal, have an aridic moisture regime and are on adjacent south slopes.  Powellbutte  soils are fine-loamy and are on adjacent north slopes.  Skullhollow soils are loamy-skeletal and are on adjacent north slopes.  Teguro soils are fine-loamy and shallow to bedrock."
