  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist in some part above 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is just over 59 degrees F. A calcic horizon occurs slightly less than 20 inches below the surface. Slickensides may be present, but are too few or too far apart to intersect and the soil lacks wedge-shaped aggregates.\nThe Castro soils have very dark gray, fine textured, granular and blocky, calcareous A1 horizons over gray to white fine textured, highly calcareous Cca horizons which are weakly to strongly cemented in some horizons.\nColor of the A1 horizons range from dark gray to black in 10YR and neutral hues. Texture ranges from clay to silty clay. The surface develops a strong fine granular structure and the remainder of the A1 has moderate or strong subangular blocky structure. The A1 is weakly to strongly calcareous with disseminated lime and a few, small hard lime concretions may or may not be present. Organic matter is between 2 and 4 percent.\nUpper Cca horizons have their upper boundaries within 20 inches of the surface. There is some gradation from small lime accumulations to large accumulations. Colors of the upper C and Cca horizons range from gray to white and textures are silty clay to clay. At a depth of 24 to 42 inches the Cca horizons have many hard nodular lime concretions that are weakly to strongly cemented together and this zone is 2 to 12 inches thick.\nLower C horizons, below about 40 inches, are mottled and may be stratified with textures more coarse than silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include Alamo, Bayshore, Clear Lake, Domino, Gazelle, Merril, Pozo, and Sunnyvale. Alamo and Pozo have noncalcareous, A1 horizons and pans that are wholly or partially cemented by silica, respectively. Bayshore are fine loamy and lack cementation. Clear Lake soils have many slickensides and other evidences of churning Domino and Merril soils are fine loamy family. Gazelle are very strongly alkaline. Sunnyvale lack lime cementation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Castro soils occur on nearly level basins and developed in fine textured alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations. Elevations are less than 150 feet. The climate is dry, subhumid, mesothermal, with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters; a mean annual rainfall of 10 to 20 inches; an average January temperature of about 47 degrees F; an average July temperature of about 66 degrees F; a mean annual temperature of about 58 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Castro soils occur in the same general area as Alviso, Bayshore, Campbell, Clear Lake and Sunnyvale. Alviso and Campbell soils lack cementation and strong lime accumulations."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: In their natural state these soils are poorly drained, but pumping has generally lowered the water table to a depth of 6 feet or more below the surface. Runoff is very slow and permeability is slow to very slow. The cemented horizon strongly restricts moisture movement and root penetration."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Castro soils were formerly classified as calcium carbonate solonchaks. The properties of Vertisols are too poorly developed to classify Castro as a Vertisol.\nAreas mapped as Castro soils in the 1941 Santa Clara soil survey were reviewed during the new soil survey in Santa Clara. Data collected does not have the cementation described for the Castro series and areas mapped as Castro have been correlated to the Sunnyvale series. The area of the type location and the entire area mapped as Castro has been urbanized. The Castro type location needs to be moved to Glenn County. 11/2007 WR\nLast revised by the state on 8/66.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
