  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The soil has cracks that open and close for 60 to 80 consecutive days in most years.  Slickensides are close enough to intersect in all or in some part of the control section.  Depth to a paralithic contact and fractured bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  In some pedons, the lower part of the solum may have up to 60 percent soft gravel size fragments.  The control section is clay with more than 60 percent clay.  Small (1 to 3 mm) concretions are throughout some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or less moist and dry.\nThe Bss1 and Bss2 horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or less moist and dry.\nThe Bss3 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or neutral, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry."

The soils formed in clayey colluvium weathered predominantly from basalt but also volcanic breccia and tuffs. The climate is characterized by warm and dry summers and cool and moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free period is 160 to 235 days."
