  "OVERVIEW": "The Coglin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and tuff.  Coglin soils are on tablelands and fan piedmonts with slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nf.om about March 15 to about November 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to soft powdery secondary lime is 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has an average of 35 to 45 percent clay.  There is a clay increase of 15 to 25 percent absolute between the A and 2Bt horizons.  The combined A and 2Bt horizon thickness is 5 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 20 percent gravel, 15 to 20 percent cobbles and 30 to 40 percent stones.  It is a loam with a high percentage of volcanic ash.  The sand fraction is mostly very fine and fine sand.   It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent fine gravel.  Clay films are faint to prominent.  Structure is moderate to strong prismatic parting to angular blocky.  It is clay with 40 to 50 percent clay content.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It has 5 to 20 percent fine gravel, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 4Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It has 5 to 20 percent fine gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam with a clay content of 30 to 40 percent in the upper part and ranges to silt loam or loam below a depth of 40 inches.  This horizon may contain thin lenses of brittle material 1 to 3 inches thick.  It is strongly or violently effervescent."
