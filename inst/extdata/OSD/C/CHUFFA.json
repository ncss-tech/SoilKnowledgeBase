  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuffa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and welded tuff over mixed lacustrine deposits. The Chuffa soils are on fan skirts, basin floors, and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
