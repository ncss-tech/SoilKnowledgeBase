  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavode series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained upland soils formed in residuum weathered from gray and yellow acid shale interbedded with siltstone and sandstone. These soils are found on broad ridgetops, interfluves, and sideslopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 C (51 degrees F).",

The soils developed in materials weathered from acid gray and yellow shale with some interbedded siltstone and thin-bedded sandstone. The climate is humid temperate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 12.7 C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1422 millimeters."

The Brinkerton, Ernest, Gilpin, Rayne, and Weikert soils are also nearby.  All of these soils except Armagh average less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  The moderately well drained Ernest and poorly drained Brinkerton soils have fragipans.  Gilpin, Rayne, and Weikert soils are well drained.  In addition, Gilpin and Weikert soils have bedrock within 100 centimeters. Armagh soils have a depleted matrix in all horizons between the Ap and the C horizon."

This is consistent with the historic and contemporary concept of the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.   Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters.(Ap Horizon).\nb.   Argillic horizon - The zone from 28 to 119 centimeters (Bt and Btg horizons).\nc.  Aquic conditions at or near the surface - Redoximorphic features in all horizons between the Ap horizon and 38 centimeters."
