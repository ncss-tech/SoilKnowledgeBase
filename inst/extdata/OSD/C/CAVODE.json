  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons and from 0 to 60 percent in the BC and C horizons.  The reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Fine-earth texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have E, BA, or BE horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6, and it has redoximorphic features. Textures are silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2, and it has redoximorphic features.  Fine-earth textures are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nSome pedons have a thin horizon of weathered coal with black colors and loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam textures in the B or C horizons.\nThe BC, when present, has colors and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4, and it has redoximorphic features.  Fine-earth textures range from silt loam to clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cavode soils are on broad nearly level to moderately steep upland ridgetops, sideslopes, and benches with slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The soils developed in materials weathered from acid gray and yellow shale with some interbedded siltstone and thin-bedded sandstone. The climate is humid temperate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 56 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Cavode is a member of a drainage sequence which includes the poorly drained Armagh and the moderately well drained Wharton soils.  The Brinkerton, Ernest, Gilpin, Rayne, and Weikert soils are also nearby.  All of these soils except Armagh average less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  The moderately well drained Ernest and poorly drained Brinkerton soils have fragipans.  Gilpin, Rayne, and Weikert soils are well drained.  In addition, Gilpin and Weikert soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Armagh soils have a gleyed matrix in all horizons between the Ap and the C horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location was visited and the pedon reclassified as part of the MLRA 126 soil survey Update in Southwestern Pennsylvania in November 1999 to place Cavode in the Endoaquult great group. This is consistent with the historic and contemporary concept of the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.   Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap Horizon).\nb.   Argillic horizon - The zone from 11 to 47 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).\nc.  Aquic conditions at or near the surface - Redoximorphic features in all horizons between the Ap horizon and 15 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data for the typifying pedon published in Soil Survey for Indiana County, Pennsylvania, 1968, sample No. S61 Pa-32-59(1-6), additional data available sample No. S73 Pa-10-37(1-11), No. S73 Pa-10-38(1-9), and No.S73 Pa-10-39(1-10).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
