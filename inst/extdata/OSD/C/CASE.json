  "OVERVIEW": "The Case series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous old alluvium of Tertiary age on uplands of the Southern High Plains Breaks (MLRA-77E).  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is calcareous and slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.  Between the base of the A horizon and a depth of 30 inches the soil contains more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout a layer 6 or more inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is dominantly clay loam.  Loam and fine sandy loam are less common.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from none to common.  The Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 through 8 and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the Bk horizon.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy loam.  In some pedons below a depth of 18 inches, some layers are partially indurated but are not continuous."

Shep soils formed in calcareous alluvial-colluvial sediments of Permian age.  Weymouth soils are moderately deep over weathered red clayey shales.  Mansic, Mansker, and Ost soils have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Ost soils have an argillic horizon."
