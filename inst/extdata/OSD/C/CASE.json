  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is calcareous and slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.  Between the base of the A horizon and a depth of 30 inches the soil contains more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout a layer 6 or more inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is dominantly clay loam.  Loam and fine sandy loam are less common.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from none to common.  The Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 through 8 and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the Bk horizon.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy loam.  In some pedons below a depth of 18 inches, some layers are partially indurated but are not continuous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Shep, and Weymouth series in the same family and the Mansic, Mansker, and Ost series.  Shep soils formed in calcareous alluvial-colluvial sediments of Permian age.  Weymouth soils are moderately deep over weathered red clayey shales.  Mansic, Mansker, and Ost soils have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Ost soils have an argillic horizon."

Case soils formed in calcareous old alluvium (plains sediments) containing 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 26 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 57 to 59 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite Annual PE Index ranges from 34 to 44."

The Mansic and Ost soils are on slightly less sloping positions on the landscape.  Farry and Fortyone soils formed in more sandy sediments that contain less carbonates and occur on similar landscapes."
