  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cassyhill soils are on summits and convex south-facing shoulders and back slopes of mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers. Elevation ranges from 2,100 to 4,950 feet. The climate is warm and subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."
