  "OVERVIEW": "The Cafetal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from basalt and andesite. Cafetal soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
