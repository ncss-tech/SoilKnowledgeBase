  "OVERVIEW": "The Caffey series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits over loamy and sandy stratified lacustrine sediments.  The soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, till plains, and deltas.  Permeability is rapid or moderately rapid in the upper sandy sediments and moderately slow in the underlying loamy sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe upper part of the particle-size control section averages 3 to 10 percent clay and 75 to 90 percent sand.  The lower part averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 50 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 and chroma of 0 or 1. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is  sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. The 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The 2C horizons are stratified silt, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, and loamy fine sand with occasional strata of loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or silty clay loam.  The strata vary widely in thickness and sequence of layers."
