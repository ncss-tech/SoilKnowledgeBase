    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the loamy material (2C horizon) and free carbonates ranges from 18 to 39 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe upper part of the particle-size control section averages 3 to 10 percent clay and 75 to 90 percent sand.  The lower part averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 50 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 and chroma of 0 or 1. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is  sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. The 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The 2C horizons are stratified silt, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, and loamy fine sand with occasional strata of loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or silty clay loam.  The strata vary widely in thickness and sequence of layers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Caffey soils are on nearly level to depressional areas on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in sandy deposits and in the underlying loamy and sandy stratified lacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 600 to 800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 100 to 140 days."

The depth to the water table ranges from 1 foot above the surface to 1 foot below the surface at times during the period from from October to May.  Surface runoff is very slow or ponded. Permeability is rapid or moderately rapid in the upper sandy horizons and moderately slow in the 2C horizons."
