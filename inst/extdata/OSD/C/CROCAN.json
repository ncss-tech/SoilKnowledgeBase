  "OVERVIEW": "The Crocan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Crocan soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
