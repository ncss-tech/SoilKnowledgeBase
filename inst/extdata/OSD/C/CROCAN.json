  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crocan soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions adjacent to rims.  These soils formed in residuum derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,075 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
