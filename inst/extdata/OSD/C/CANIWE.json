    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caniwe soils occur on inset fans within mountain valley fans.  These soils formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,075 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
