  "OVERVIEW": "The Caniwe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on inset fans within mountain valley fans.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degree C.",
