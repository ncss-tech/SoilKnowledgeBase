Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a soil layer from the mineral soil surface to 10 inches that has a moist bulk density of 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter or less (Bw horizon); an albic horizon from 10 to 26 inches (2E1 and 2E2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 26 to 46 inches (2E/Bw horizon); and a particle-size control section form 10 to 40 inches (2E1, 2E2, and 2E/Bw horizons).  Craddock soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.  The Craddock soils meet the requirements for the Andic subgroup and it is assumed that the acid-oxalate is less than 1.0.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Montana S-64-MONT-31-4 Lincoln, Nebraska.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
