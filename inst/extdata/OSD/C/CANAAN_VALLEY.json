The shrub layer, where present, contains St. Johnswort, northern wild raisin, red chokeberry, black chokeberry, or common winterberry.  The dwarf shrubs cranberry and bristly dewberry are very common. The herbaceous layer is dominated by tawny cottongrass, bog goldenrod, northern long sedge, and common rush. Common non-vascular plants consist of sphagnum spp., polytrichum spp."
