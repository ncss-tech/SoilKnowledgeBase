  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coveland soils are in valleys and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 90 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is about 635 to 1016 mm. The average annual temperature is about 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the upper part (A and E horizons) and moderately high to moderately low in the lower part (Btg and Cd horizons). Coveland soils have a perched water table as high as 0 to 23 cm from November to March and 23 to 91 cm in October, April and May, unless the soil is drained. At lower slope ranges, Coveland soils are subject to frequent ponding for long durations from December to March and for brief duration during October, November, and April."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 23 to 51 cm (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 51 to 112 cm (Btg horizons)\nDensic contact - 112 cm (upper boundary of Cd horizon)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 51 to 101 cm (upper 50 cm of the argillic horizon)\nDepth to redoximorphic features - 23 cm\nThis revision (5/2006) includes a change in classification and typical pedon, based on laboratory data and field investigations. The previous classification was fine, isotic, mesic Aquic Palexeralfs. The typical pedon was moved from Skagit County to San Juan County.\nFurther investigation needed for similar Agnew series. Under current classification the only difference is active vs. superactive CEC class. Agnew series are likely deep instead of very deep to a densic contact.\nAdditional Data: NSSL pedons 04N0406, 04N0407, 40A0998, and 40A0999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
