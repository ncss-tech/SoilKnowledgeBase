Based on lab data.\nParticle-size control section (Loamy-skeletal family) - from a depth of 14 to 44 inches (6 inches of the AB horizon, all of the Bw horizon, and 6 inches of the C horizon).\nMedial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nThe Cr over R bedrock contact is recognized as a diagnostic feature for this series.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nClassification revised 08/2002 from loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Dystrudepts to loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Andic Dystrudepts based on lab data from the modal pedon and associated soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available for pedons S01OR-003-012 and S01OR-003-013, NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 5/02.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
