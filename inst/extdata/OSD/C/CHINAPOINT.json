  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinapoint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Chinapoint soils are on hills and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 255 millimeters (about 10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17.5 degrees C. (63.5 degrees F.).",
