  "OVERVIEW": "The Canelo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in old gravelly alluvium from andesite, rhyolite and quartzite rocks. Canelo soils are on old alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
