The Dovecanyon, Friedliver, Goldivide, Goldpeak, Helendale, Jumborox, Searchlight, Sonoita, and tray soils are all very deep soils and do not have a paralithic contact within 150 centimeters, and are formed mainly in alluvium. Hexie and Littlefargo are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. In addition Sonoita soils are moist greater than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Friedliver soils have an upper boundary of the argillic horizon between 25 and 50 centimeters, and Goldivid within 50 to 100 centimeters. Tray soils are strongly to very strongly alkaline in all parts and have an argillic horizon with an ESP of 15 to 30. Wingap soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C."
