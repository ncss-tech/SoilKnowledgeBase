The amount of sandstone or shaly materials is variable and either may be absent in some pedons.\nOther features--Roots penetrate the materials but are concentrated along fractures or cleavage planes. Most pedons have clay flows along some vertical fractures. Many pedons have discontinuous, fractured, strongly cemented or indurated sandstone layers about 1 inch to 4 inches thick.

Albertville soils have a solum that is 40 to 60 inches thick. Badin soils are underlain by fine-grained metavolcanic bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Bengal and Carnasaw soils have an irregular lower boundary over tilted shaly bedrock of Pennsylvanian age. Bonwier, Galilee and Urland soils formed in Pleistocene age parent materials. In addition, Urland soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick. Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a 2Bt horizon and a solum more than 40 inches thick, and formed over mica schist bedrock. Cunningham soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent in upper part of the Bt horizon. Coghill soils formed in residuum from Ordovician-aged limestones, shales, and sandstones. Corryton soils formed in residuum weathered from Cambrian and Ordovician aged shales and have a thicker solum. Enders soils have a thicker solum and formed in loamy and clayey residuum weathered from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone of late Mississippian or Pennsylvanian age. Kirvin soils have a solum that is 40 to 60 inches thick. Nason soils formed in materials weathered from fractured serecite schist. Luverne soils do not have ironstone fragments. Marbledale, Masada, Mattaponi and McQueen soils formed in alluvium, have a solum more than 40 inches thick, and do not have shale or sandstone layers. Mayodan soils formed in materials weathered from Triassic age sandstone, mudstone, shale, and siltstone. Sweatman soils have more than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Remlap and Tatum soils formed in residuum from sericite schist or phyllite. Townley soils have a paralithic contact to shale within a depth of 40 inches and do not have ironstone fragments in the solum. Uwharrie soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and formed in residuum weathered from fine grained metamorphic or igneous pyroclastic rocks. Vance soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic crystalline rock, primarily aplitic granite.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cuthbert soils are on moderately sloping to steep uplands, generally on long narrow side slopes above drainageways. Slope gradients are commonly 8 to 25 percent but range from 5 to 40 percent. The soil formed in weakly consolidated loamy, sandy and shaly materials mainly of the Claiborne Geologic group of Tertiary age. Climate is humid or subhumid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 56 inches, with frost-free rainfall of 25 to 30 inches. The summer moisture deficit is 4 to 6 inches. Frost free days range from 235 to 270 and elevation ranges from 400 to 750 feet above sea level. Mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 67 degrees F, and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceeds 64."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Kirvin series which are on nearby stream divides and low ridges and the Bowie, Nacogdoches, Redsprings, Sacul, Tenaha, and Trawick series. Bowie soils have a fine-loamy control section, are on lower concave positions, or on higher interstream divide positions. Nacogdoches and Redsprings soils have a solum thicker than 40 inches. In addition, Nacogdoches soils are mainly on inter'stream divides. Redsprings soils are on positions similar to Cuthbert, have base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower part of the solum, and have kaolinitic mineralogy. Trawick soils have a paralithic contact of glauconite and have a dark surface layer, and are on higher positions on the landscape. Sacul soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and have aquic conditions within the upper two feet of the argillic horizon. They are generally on more level ridgetop positions, concave side slopes or heads of drains. Tenaha soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick and are on similar positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The concept, as now defined, closely parallels the original concept of the series as outlined in the series description dated 10-16-62. The series was inactivated in 1971. In redefining the series, the type location was moved to Texas. Redefined somewhat and returned to active status in 1973.  The series was updated in 2004 to allow the A horizon to range to 9 inches thick.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to 8 inches, includes A and E horizons.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 34 inches, includes the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt/C horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lincoln Soil Survey Investigations Unit 73L474-73L479 Nacogdoches County, Texas. This is the type location for the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
