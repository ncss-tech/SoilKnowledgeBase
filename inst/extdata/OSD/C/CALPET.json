  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Calpet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on escarpments and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
