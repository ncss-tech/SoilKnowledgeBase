  "OVERVIEW": "The Chetwynd series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy and sandy outwash. Chetwynd soils are on dissected outwash plains. Slope ranges from 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
