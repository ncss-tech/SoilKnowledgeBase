  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chetwynd soils are on back slopes and shoulders of dissected outwash plains. Slope ranges from 8 to 80 percent. Chetwynd soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 210 days."
