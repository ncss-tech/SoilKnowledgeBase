  "OVERVIEW": "The Clems series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian deposits.  They are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
