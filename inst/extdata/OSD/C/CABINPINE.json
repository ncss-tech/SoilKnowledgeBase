  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabinpine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. These soils are on floodplains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
