Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,750 to 2,010 meters. The climate is dry, sub-humid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 450 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."
