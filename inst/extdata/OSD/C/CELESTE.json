  "OVERVIEW": "The Celeste series consists of well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in stony, medium textured, noncalcareous parent sediments weathered residually or only locally transported from beds of rhyolite.  Celeste soils are on moderate to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Typically, Celeste soils have very friable, noncalcareous, medium textured A horizons that rest abruptly on hard rhyolite bedrock.",

The control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  It is uniform with only minor discontinuous stratification.  The soils range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Hue ranges from 5YR through 10R."
