The soils formed in stony, medium textured, noncalcareous parent sediments weathered residually or only locally transported from beds of rhyolite.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
