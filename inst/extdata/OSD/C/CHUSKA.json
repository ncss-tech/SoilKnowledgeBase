  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuska series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained, soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and flow rock.  They are on terraces, dipslopes, ridges, hills and fan remnants, with slopes of 1 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the average air annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
