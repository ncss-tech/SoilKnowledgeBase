  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Cumberstone soils were previously mapped with the Keyport (fine, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Hapludults) and Mattapex (fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Hapludults) series, however the heaviest textures in Cumberstone soils occur below the particle-size control section and therefore the soils behave similarly to Keyport, but do not classify as Keyport. Cumberstone soils are heavier textured than Mattapex soils in the lower subsoil and substratum due to the clayey buried A and Bt horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zones from 23 to 84 cm (Bt and Btg horizons) and from 137 to 157 cm (2Btgb horizon).\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 60 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nOther features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 183 cm\nBuried soil zone below 84 cm (2Agb1, 2Agb2, 2Btgb and 2BCgb horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity-abrupt textural contact starting at a depth of 84 cm (2Agb1 horizon). Although not a strongly contrasting particle size difference, particle size analysis indicates distinct difference in particle size distribution and there is some evidence that mineralogy is distinctly different.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S95MD-003-002 and analyzed by the Pedology Lab at the University of Maryland.\nData Mapunit ID (type location): To be developed\nPrevious revisions: 2001-SLD,DRV,EHE; 11/2002-DAS,JAK; 10/2004-SLD,DHK, 8/2005-JWB\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
