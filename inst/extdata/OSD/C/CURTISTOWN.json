Texture is silt loam or, where severely eroded, silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6.  The darker colors are in the lower part.  Texture is silty clay loam in the upper part and clay or silty clay in the lower part."

Blevins soils have yellowish brown and brownish yellow B horizons and high content of very fine sand.  Crider and Pembroke soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent and soil temperature less than 59 degrees F.  Etowah soils have more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand including coarse fragments in the B horizon.  Mountview soils have yellowish brown or strong brown colors in the upper part of the B horizon.  Pickwick soils have greater than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the B horizon."

The soils formed in a mixture of loess and old alluvium in the upper part, and old alluvium in the lower part.  Bedrock is limestone.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 51 inches."
