    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to iron masses in the matrix ranges from 6 to 20 inches. The iron masses in the matrix are relic and not indicative of the current soil-water state.  Depth to carbonates typically ranges from 40 to 60 inches but may range from 16 to 60 inches.  Depth to the 2Bk and 2C material ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (3 or 4 moist), and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 (4 to 7 moist), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkb and 2C horizon have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 (5 to 7 moist), and chroma of 1 or 2.  The 2Bkb horizon is fine sandy loam or loam.  The 2C horizon is sand to loamy fine sand.  Calcium carbonate equivalents range from 10 to 30 percent in the 2Bk horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in both horizons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dankworth, Optima and Scoville series in the same family.  Curtis Siding (T), Dwyer, Mespun, Mido, Orpha, Pensom, Pinavetes (T), Reepo (T), Tullock, Valent and Wigton series may be reclassified to this family.  Dankworth and Optima soils do not have contrasting loamy layers in the lower part of the series control section.  Scoville soils formed in alluvium that has more very fine sand and less medium sand.  Curtis Siding soils contain more than 15 percent by volume of gravel in the particle size control section.  Dwyer soils lack a lithologic discontinuity and are calcareous above 15 inches.  Mespun and Valent soils are excessively drained and lack a lithologic discontinuity.  Mido soils are deep over sandstone.  Orpha and Pinavetes soils are very deep over sandstone. Reepo and Tullock soils are moderately deep over sandstone.  Wigton soils have hard or very hard consistence in the C horizon."

Dailey soils lack a calcareous substratum, have a mollic epipedon, and are slightly higher on the landscape.  Jayem soils are well drained, coarse-loamy, and are higher on the landscape.  Laird soils have a calcareous, loamy, substratum at depths less than 20 inches below the surface and are on concave, lower, landscape positions.  Overlake soils have a loamy, calcareous substratum at depths between 20 and 40 inches and are on slightly lower landscape positions."

Since then, the ground water table in the areas of the Colfer soils has declined from a depth of a few feet to depths of more than 10 feet.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 7 inches (the A horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
