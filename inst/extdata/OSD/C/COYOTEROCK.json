    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coyoterock soils are in moist locations on poorly incised drainages, hillslope hollows, and earthflows on mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 158 to 1220 meters (515 to 4000 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. This soil also has a dry phase when used in MLRA 5 where there is no marine layer influence in the summers. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 2550 millimeters (60 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost free season is about 200 to 260 days."
