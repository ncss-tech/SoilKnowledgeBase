  "OVERVIEW": "The Chatticup series consists of very shallow and shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from altered granitic and metamorphic rocks. Chatticup soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 to 69 degrees F.",
