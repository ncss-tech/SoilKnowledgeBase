  "OVERVIEW": "The Clenage series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt and interbedded sediments with additions of loess on ridgetops and hillslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than half of the time.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 42 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and a chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  They are gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.  They are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk and 3Btk horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  They are very gravelly clay, extremely cobbly clay, or extremely gravelly clay.  Structure is moderate to strong subangular blocky, angular blocky or prismatic.  They are slightly or moderately alkaline."

Berning, Bilbo, Lizzysprings, Pula and Tenmile soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Havingdon soils have clay films along fracture planes of chert bedrock and have 50 to 80 percent pebbles of dominantly angular chert and shale in the particle-size control section.   Maderbak soils lack fractured basalt with silica coatings and lack a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon.  Pulcan and Zephan soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Surgem and Vanwyper soils lack accumulations of secondary lime at the lithic contact and lack a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in interbedded sediments, residuum and colluvium from basalt and some loess. Elevations are 600 to 2,000 feet. These soils are in an arid climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is about 29 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 50 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is about 49 to 51 degrees F.
