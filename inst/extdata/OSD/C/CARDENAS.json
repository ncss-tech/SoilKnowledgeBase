    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Herlong (T  CA), Pocum (AZ), and Rolie (AZ) series.  Similar soils are the Blakeney, Conger, Kolar, Monterosa, Pastern, and Pastura series.  Herlong soils have a petrocalcic horizon consisting of calcium carbonate tufa.  The Pocum series has a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the soil surface.  The Rolie and Pastura soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Pastern soils are drier in the early summer, have a Bk horizon with more than 15 percent rock fragments.  Blakeney, Conger, Kolar, and Monterosa soils have a thermic temperature regime.  In addition, Monterosa soils are in the loamy-skeletal family.  Pastern soils do not have a calcic horizon."

The soils formed in alluvial and eolian materials derived mainly from mixed sources.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 11 to 13 inches, with 50 to 60 percent of this occurring in July, August, September and October.  The frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days and elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,200 feet."
