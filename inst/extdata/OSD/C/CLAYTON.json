Nevat soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Bestrom soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Cassolary soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 and redox concentrations within 20 inches and do not have lamellae. Hudnut soils do not have E&Bt horizons. Koerling soils have 2Bk horizons (calcareous lake sediments) with sandy loam to silty clay loam textures at a depth of 24 to 40 inches. Koseth soils have calcareous loamy-skeletal glacial till in the lower 2C horizon and do not have lamellae. Scala soils have Bw horizons."

Ongoing soil temperature data is being collected for this series to confirm soil temperature regime for Spokane County. Based on vegetation, this area is borderline mesic and possibly frigid.\nMineralogy changed to isotic 10/2001.\nThe 10/2003 update reflects a move in the type location to a mesic location in Spokane County.  The type location in Stevens county is frigid and will be correlated to the Stapaloop series.\nInvestigation of Clayton mapped in Pend Oreille County, WA.,(SSA's WA651 and perhaps the Panhandle NF 752) is needed to evaluate the mesic/frigid soil temperature regime break.\nThe 9/2009 revision reflects an update to the use and vegetation section to better represent a mesic plant community.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
