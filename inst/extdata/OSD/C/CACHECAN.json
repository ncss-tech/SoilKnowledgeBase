  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delish, Trenton, and Preston soils.  Delish soils are somewhat poorly drained, have mottles at 15 to 22 inches, and occur on low stream terraces.  Trenton soils are fine textured and occur on slightly higher stream terraces.  Preston soils are sandy and occur on dunes."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 3.5 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between January and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding between February and May."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A horizon and part of the Bw1 horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 20 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 30 and 42 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bg and Cg horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2 and Bg horizons and parts of the Bw1 and Cg horizons).\nThe superactive CEC activity class was assigned based on the CEC and total clay values in the NASIS database.  The aquic subgroup was not used based on the assumption that aquic conditions are below 30 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
