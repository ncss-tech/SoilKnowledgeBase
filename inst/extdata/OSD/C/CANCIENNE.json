  "REVDATE": "02/2013",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cancienne series consists of very deep, level to gently undulating, somewhat poorly drained mineral soils that are moderately slowly permeable. These soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium. They are on high and intermediate positions on natural levees and deltaic fans of the Mississippi River and its distributaries. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Commerce soils are in a thermic soil temperature family. Carville soils average less than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Mhoon soils have a depleted gray or olive gray matrix throughout the subsoil and substratum."

Carville soils are on similar positions, or on younger natural levees and are coarse-silty. Mhoon soils are on the lower parts or on flats on natural levees and have a reduced, gray or olive gray matrix throughout the subsoil and substratum. Gramercy and Schriever soils are on lower backswamp positions and are clayey to depths of more than 30 inches. Vacherie soils are on the lower parts of natural levees and have coarse-silty upper solum over a clayey discontinuity beginning within a depth of 40 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Cancienne soils are somewhat poorly drained; runoff is medium to slow and permeability is moderately slow. A saturated zone is perched above the clayey lenses or layers and is at 1.5 to 4 feet below the surface during December through April. Most areas are protected from flooding by levees. Along the larger leveed waterways, water between the clayey lenses or layers in the lower part of the solum may be under pressure due to the hydraulic head maintained by the higher water level in the river. Unprotected areas are subject to occasional or frequent flooding for brief to long durations."
