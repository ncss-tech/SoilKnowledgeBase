  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cameek soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with eolian additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
