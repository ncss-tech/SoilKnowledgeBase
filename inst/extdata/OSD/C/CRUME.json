    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperatures ranges from 44 degrees to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist and are dry 65 to 90 days during the summer. Depth to soft bedrock or hardpan ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Hard lava pebbles average 0 to 10 percent in the 10- to 40-inch control section. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry. It has 0 to 20 percent pumice cinders about 2 to 4mm in diameter, a total of 10 to 30 percent cinders and ash, and 0 to 10 percent hard lava pebbles about 2 to 5mm in diameter.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Clay films, where present, are lacking on either vertical or horizontal faces of peds, or in fine pores or the increase in the clay ratio of as much as 1.2 in the B2 horizons is not reached within the vertical distance of 12 inches. Pumice cinders and hard pebbles less than 5mm each average 0 to 10 percent of the volume.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay. This horizon is weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. It has 0 to 15 percent hard pebbles less than 5mm in diameter."

Lobert soils are coarse-loamy and have mollic epipedons 20 to more than 40 inches thick.  Twisp soils have loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam B2 horizons and lack appreciable amounts of ash."
