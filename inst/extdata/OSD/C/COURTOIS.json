  "OVERVIEW": "The Courtois series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ridges and sideslopes in upland basins and valley slopes. They formed in loess and red clayey materials. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Courtois soils are on ridgetop and side slope positions in the larger valleys or mountain basins. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. The soils have had a complicated geomorphic history.  The upper 13 inches is loess or possibly paleosediment (old valley fill) in some pedons. A stone line (where present) represents a prior period of surface erosion and accumulation of rounded, water-worn chert gravel and cobbles. The red clay is probably lacustrine or paleosediment deposites, over residuum from dolostone. Average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."
