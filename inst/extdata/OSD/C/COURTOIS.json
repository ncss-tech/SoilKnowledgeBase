  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Courtois soils are on ridgetop and side slope positions in the larger valleys or mountain basins. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. The soils have had a complicated geomorphic history.  The upper 13 inches is loess or possibly paleosediment (old valley fill) in some pedons. A stone line (where present) represents a prior period of surface erosion and accumulation of rounded, water-worn chert gravel and cobbles. The red clay is probably lacustrine or paleosediment deposites, over residuum from dolostone. Average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Caneyville soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on lower slopes. Clarksville, Goss, Killarney, and Wilderness soils are skeletal and on steeper slopes above the Courtois soils. Fourche soils are fine silty and have a water table, and Lowell and Useful soils are deep to bedrock and are on similar landscape positions."
