Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate medium or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic accumulations may be present.\nThe  Bt/E horizon has colors similar to the Bt and E horizons respectively. Textures are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, but averaging less than 28 percent clay. Structure is weak or moderate medium or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic features may be present.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction,  with individual subhorizons ranging to clay loam or silty clay loam, but averaging less than 28 percent clay. It has weak to strong, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic depletions are present.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that is friable or firm with colors similar to the B horizon and textures similar to the C horizon\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. It has firm or very firm consistence, but can include lenses of friable water-sorted material. Redoximorphic features may be present."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Aurora, Danley, Grindstone, and Nunda series are members of the same family. Aurora soils have bedrock within a depth of 51 to 102 cm. Danley soils have bedrock deeper than 102 cm and have an average clay content of 28 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Grindstone soils have sola ranging from 30 to 84 cm. Nunda soils have a silty mantle that ranges from 33 to 76 cm thick.\nThe Cassopolis, Cazenovia, Elbaville, Guelph, Hilton, Honeoye, Hortonville, Lansing, Lima, Mariette, Ontario, Remus, Wampsville, and Wassaic series are in related families. Cassopolis soils have a lower rock fragment content in the substratum. Cazenovia soils have 28 to 35 percent clay and hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR in the Bt horizons. Elbaville soils redoximorphic features in the subsoil and do not have a Cd horizon. Guelph soils have solums that are less than 64 cm thick. Hilton soils contain more than 35 percent sand in the Bt horizon. Honeoye and Lansing soils either lack mottling in the Bt horizon or mottling is limited to the lower 10 cm of the Bt horizon. Hortonville soils have hue redder than 10YR in the B horizons. Lima soils have sola that are less than 76 cm thick. Marlette soils lack mottling in the B horizons. Ontario soils lack mottling in the Bt horizons and contain more than 35 percent sand. Remus soils lack mottles in the B horizon and have less rock fragments in the substratum. Wampsville soils have stratified sand and gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Wassaic soils have bedrock within 51 to 102 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Conesus soils are nearly level to sloping soils on till plains, glaciated dissected plateaus, and drumlin fields. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent, but are as great as 25 percent locally. The soils formed in till of late Wisconsin age derived from shale with varying components of limestone and fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1450 mm, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 100 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 390 to 1950 ft above sea level."

The well drained Lansing, somewhat poorly drained Kendaia and Appleton, and poorly or very poorly drained Lyons soils are in drainage sequence with Conesus soils. Amboy soils contain a fragipan and have coarse-silty particle-size control section. Arkport and Colonie soils are dominantly fine sandy loam and fine sand, respectively. Aurora soils are 51 to 102 cm deep to bedrock. Dunkirk soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections. Howard soils formed in glacial outwash and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: It is known that Oxyaquic Hapludalfs lacking 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon occur in some surveys and will be accommodated as inclusions in the mapping unit of the Conesus series or may be accommodated as a new series.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typifying pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from the surface to 23 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 91 cm (B/E and Bt horizons).\n3. Glossaquic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of albic material around pedons in the upper part of the argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon), and low chroma mottles in the upper 25 cm of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory for pedon S86NY077-3.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
