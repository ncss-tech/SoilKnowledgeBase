  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 60 inches.  Depth to stratification ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments typically are absent throughout the soil, but some pedons have up to 3 percent gravel and cobbles.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the A and E horizons, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are above 40 inches.  Redox depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Value dry is greater than 5.5.  Some pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry, of 7 or more.  It is silt loam or silt.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.\nCrystal Lake soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Typically, it has thin strata of silt, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand, fine sand, or sand, in at least the lower part.\nThe C horizon typically is silt loam with thin strata of coarser texture.  It has color and stratification similar to the Bt horizon described above."

Similar soils are the Brill, Campia, Doritty, Freeon, Otterholt, and Wickware series.  Kneff, Gichigami, and Oronto soils have free carbonates within the series conmtrol section.  Spencer soils do not have stratified lacustrine deposits in the lower part of the series control section and have 5 to 35 percent gravel there.  Brill soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Campia, Otterholt and Wickware soils do not have redox features and do not have a water table.  Doritty soils do not have stratified lacustrine deposits in the control section and do not have a water table within 40 inches for one month or more per year in 6 out of 10 years.  Freeon soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crystal Lake soils are on Kames glacial lake plains and outwash terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 45 percent.  Crystal Lake soils formed in lacustrine deposits dominated by silt and very fine sand.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow or medium.  Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  These soils have a perched seasonal water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out ot 10 years.  The water table is perched over lacustrine sediments but in most years will eventually saturate the lacustrine sediments and exhibit an apparent water table."
