  "OVERVIEW": "The Coxlake series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  These soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The lower part of the horizon is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam and is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe AC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist and is mottled.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.
