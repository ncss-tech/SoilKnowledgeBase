These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and is mottled with chromas of 2 or less above 30 inches.  The particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist and is mottled.  The lower part of the horizon is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam and is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe AC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist and is mottled.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 0 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand and is gravelly or very gravelly in some pedons.  Stratification of textures is comm on.  It is 5 to 45 percent rock fragments."

Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
