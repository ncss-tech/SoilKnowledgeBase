  "OVERVIEW": "The Corum series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on fan terraces along the margins of Rodgers Dry Lake.  These soils formed in granitic fan alluvium that has overwashed material weathered from granitic rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils may have some lacustrine influence, but are dominantly from granitic fan alluvium derived from hills.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 12 inches (A1, A2, A3)\n1.1  Organic carbon assumed to be less than 0.6 percent based on laboratory analysis of similar soils in surrounding surveys.\n1.2  Moist color of 10YR 4/3.\n2. Natric horizon -- 12 to 15 inches (2Btn).\n2.1  Weak coarse columnar structure.\n2.2  Sandy clay loam texture with an increase of 10 percent clay content from the A horizon based on field estimates.\n2.3  Common thin clay films bridging mineral grains and on ped faces.\n2.4  It is 3 inches thick (minimum thickness for natric horizon).\n2.5  SAR is assumed to be over 13 within 40 cm of its upper boundary based on the pH of 8.8 in this horizon and a pH of 9.2 in the underlying 2Bkn horizon.  Reference samples were sent to the Lincoln Lab to confirm assumptions.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\n1. Typic subgroup: Meets all requirements of the Typic subgroup.\n2. TEMPERATURE REGIME -- Thermic.  Mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 72 degrees F.  Based on soil temperature data from surrounding soil surveys and preliminary field measurements.\n3. MINERALOGY -- Mixed; no evidence to support any other.\n4. PARTICLE SIZE CLASS -- Fine-loamy.  The 12- to 15-inch particle-size control section averages 20 percent clay based on field estimates.\n5. MOISTURE REGIME - Aridic.  Based on soil moisture data from surrounding soil surveys.\nThe graph below is a representation of the moisture control section.\nMonths:      J   F   M   A   M   J   J   A   S   O   N   D  DAYS:\n|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|\nDRY\nTHROUGHOUT  |...|...<-------------290 days---------------->.|\nMOIST IN SOME\nOR ALL PART -75 days>...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|.<-\nEXCEEDS 41\nDEGREES F. <-------------------365 days-------------------->\nEXCEEDS 47\nDEGREES F. |...|..<--------------303 days---------------->.|\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015.
