  "OVERVIEW": "The Covegap series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnant in mountain valleys.  They are formed in colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale deposited over limestone.  Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and moderately slow to moderate in the lower solum.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 51 degrees.",
