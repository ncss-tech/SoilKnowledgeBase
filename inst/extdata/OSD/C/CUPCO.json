    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar series include the Acy (LA), Alikchi (OK), Amagon (AR), Bissonnet (TX), Essen (LA), Galvez (LA), Guyton (LA), Hebert (LA), Lightning (OK), McGehee (AR), Patoutville (LA), Percilla (TX), Tenot (LA), and Tichnor (AR) series. Acy, Essen, Galvez, Hebert, McGehee, and Patoutville soils have mixed mineralogy. In addition, Acy soils have a lower Bt horizon that is slightly or moderately alkaline. Essen\nand Galvez soils have a solum thickness that ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Hebert soils are slightly warmer and have an apparent water table. McGehee soils have silty clay 2BC and 2C horizons. Patoutville soils are slightly warmer and have red redoximorphic iron concentrations in the Bt horizon. Alikchi, Bissonnet, and Guyton soils have an albic horizon tonguing into the Bt horizon. Amagon and Tichnor soils have mixed mineralogy and they have A horizons that have chroma of 1 or 2 throughout. Lightning and Percilla soils have a fine control section. In addition, Percilla soils have kaolinitic mineralogy. Tenot soils have an abrupt textural change\nbetween the albic and argillic horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Avilla, Dela, Kenn, Neff, Rexor, and Speer series. Avilla soils are on higher terrace positions and are well drained. Dela soils do not have a Bt horizon and have a coarse-loamy control section. Dela soils occur on larger streams near the stream channel. Kenn soils are on level to gently rolling flood plains and are well drained. Neff and Rexor soils occur on slightly convex areas. Neff and Rexor soils have a udic moisture regime and do not have chroma of 1 or 2 as redoximorphic iron depletion coatings on the faces of peds and redoximorphic iron depletions in shades of gray\nredoximorphic iron concentrations in shades of brown within peds of the argillic horizon. Speer soils are on slightly higher areas and have a fine-loamy control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Cupco soils are very poorly drained. Runoff is negligible and permeability is moderately slow. A perched water table ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 feet of the surface during the winter and spring months. These soils are subject to rare and occasional flooding for very brief to brief periods, mainly during January to July."
