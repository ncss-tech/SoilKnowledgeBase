  "STATES": "IN,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheektowaga series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in sandy deposits overlying clayey lacustrine sediments. They are nearly level soils on lake plains. Permeability is rapid in the surface and sandy subsoil, and slow or very slow in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to the underlying fine textured material ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The soil contains few or no coarse fragments. Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum but ranges to moderately alkaline in the lower part just above the clayey material. Reaction of the substratum is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand to very fine sandy loam. The Ap or A1 horizon has weak or moderate, fine or very fine granular structure.\nThe Eg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and it has redoximorphic features. It is loamy fine sand to sand. The Eg horizon has very weak or weak, very fine or fine granular structure, and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loamy fine sand to sand. The Bg horizon has very weak or weak fine or medium subangular blocky or very weak or weak medium through very thick platy structure. It has friable or very friable consistence.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. They have common or many high and low chroma redoximorphic features. The 2C horizon is silty clay loam to clay with more than 35 percent clay. It is massive with or without plate-like depositional varves."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in the same family.\nCosad, Granby, Junius, Scarboro, Wareham, Wauseon, and Whately are similar soils in related families. Cosad soils lack dominant chromas of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches and lacks a mollic epipedon.  Granby soils have a sandy particle size control section. Junius, Scarboro and Wareham lack mollic epipedons and contrasting particle size control sections. Wauseon and Whately soils are coarse-loamy in the upper part of the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are in low lying nearly level and depressional areas of lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Cheektowaga soils formed in sandy deltaic deposits overlying fine textured lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches, the growing season from 120 to 180 days, and the mean annual air temperature from 46 degrees to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Claverack and somewhat poorly drained Cosad soils that are in a drainage sequence with Cheektowaga. Also associated are the Alton, Arkport, Colonie, Howard, Lakemont, Madalin, and Palmyra soils. Alton, Howard and Palmyra soils formed in glacial outwash and contains high contents of gravel within 40 inches. Arkport and Colonie are deep, well drained and excessively drained soils that formed in sandy deltaic deposits. Lakemont and Madalin are poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey lacustrine deposits."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Indiana is using this series in LaPorte County. It is doubtful it will be retained in a future update, but it is active for the time being.\nThe type location seems to be in error and was corrected. The location seems to be '2.2 miles northwest, not northeast' and '1.7 miles east of Highway NY 78, not NY 73'. The original location makes no sense and there is a Cheektowaga map unit at the replacement location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Aquic moisture regime as evidenced by redoximorphic features within 9 inches of the mineral surface (Eg, Bg1, and Bg2).\n3) Episaturation above the varved silty clay substratum.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
