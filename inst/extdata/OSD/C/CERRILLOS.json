  "STATES": "CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cerrillos series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from alluvial, eolian, and colluvial materials derived from monzonite, granite, shale, and sandstone on knolls and treads of fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cerrillos soils are on gently sloping knolls and treads of fan remnants at elevations of 5,400 to 7,200 feet.  The soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured sediments of alluvial, eolian, and colluvial materials.  The sediments originated principally from monzonite and granite with some shale and sandstone additions.  The climate at the type location is semiarid continental with mean annual precipitation of 10 to 13 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost free period is 140 to 170 days."
