  "OVERVIEW": "The Crubas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soil that formed in alluvium from metamorphic rock.  Crubas soils are on valley bottoms and swales.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
