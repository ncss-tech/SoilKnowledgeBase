  "REVDATE": "01/2023",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crubas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soil that formed in alluvium from metamorphic rock.  Crubas soils are on valley bottoms and swales.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
