  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canisteo series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous, loamy till or in a thin mantle of loamy or silty sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy till.  These soils are on rims of depressions, depressions and flats on moraines or till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean air annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 785 millimeters.",

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:\nMost areas are artificially drained and cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. Native vegetation is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod. The native vegetation on very poorly drained ponded phases is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges."
