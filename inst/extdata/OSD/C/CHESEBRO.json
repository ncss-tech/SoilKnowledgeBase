  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chesebro soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on north-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash flow and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and rhyodacite. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,360 to 1,955 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Derallo soils are deep to paralithic contacts, have a mollic epipedon that is less than 50 cm thick, have an aridic moisture regime, and are on south and west-facing slopes. Jacksplace soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons that are 23 to 30 cm thick, have an aridic moisture regime, and are on lava plateaus."
