  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crazycoyote soils are on linear to slightly concave and convex positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 200 to 900 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 to 3050 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 280 days."
