  "OVERVIEW": "The Coly series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loess. Coly soils are on sideslopes of uplands in MLRA  73-Rolling Plains and Breaks. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C ( 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 53 centimeters ( 21 inches) at the type location.",

Colby soils are now limited to a drier (33 to 51 centimeters (13 to 20 inches precipitation)) climate.\nThe series Typical Pedon was moved from Stockton to Eustis. This site fits the series concept and was sampled in 1979. The pedon number is 79NE063002. The National Soil Survey Lab report can be found at :\nhttp://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/rptExecute.asp?p=7237&r=1&submit1=Get+Report\n07/12 CWL\nIntroductory Paragraph: Added full MLRA name. Removed 'calcareous, silty' from loess description.\nType Location: Added USGS Quadrangle.\nRange of Characteristics: Changed format to semitabular. Added statement for moisture regime. Added Clay Content. Added Reaction to horizons.\nCompeting Series: Removed Crofton. Added depth to shale for Cucho.\nGeographic setting: Restated ranges for slope, mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. Removed 'calcareous, silty' from loess description. Removed 'steep' from sideslopes.\nGeographically Associated Soils: Removed Kenesaw. Restated properties for remaining soils.\nChanged Permeability to Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity\nChanged Runoff from 'medium and very rapid' to 'low to high'.\nUse and Vegetation: Added corn, soybeans and alfalfa\nDistribution and Extent: Added south-central South Dakota.\nRemoved Series Data Record data.\nAdded Metric UOM.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample numbers 79NE063002 and 80NE175062\nTaxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
