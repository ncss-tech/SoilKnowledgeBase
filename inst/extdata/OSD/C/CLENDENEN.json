  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to dense glacial till is 14 to 20 inches. The till retards roots and water movement.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  The control section averages from 40 to 70 percent pebbles.  Thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 6 to 13 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe matrix of the Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  Organic stains have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  They are loam or silt loam with 40 to 70 percent pebbles by weighted average.  Reaction is very strongly acid, strongly acid, or medium acid.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is dense glacial till that breaks to loam or sandy loam with 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clendenen soils are on glacially modified mountainsides with slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The elevation is 2,600 to 4,000 feet.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, colluvium and glacial till.  These soils are in a marine climate with cold, wet winters, and cool, dry summers and snow cover from November through May.   The average annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches.  Average January temperature is about 28 degrees F, and average July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."
