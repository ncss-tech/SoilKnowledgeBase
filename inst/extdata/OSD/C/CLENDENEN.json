  "OVERVIEW": "The Clendenen series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, colluvium and glacial till. Clendenen soils are on glacially modified mountain sides.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 90 inches.",

The control section averages from 40 to 70 percent pebbles.  Thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 6 to 13 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe matrix of the Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  Organic stains have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  They are loam or silt loam with 40 to 70 percent pebbles by weighted average.  Reaction is very strongly acid, strongly acid, or medium acid.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is dense glacial till that breaks to loam or sandy loam with 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid."
