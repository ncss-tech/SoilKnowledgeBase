  "OVERVIEW": "The Crockett series consists of soils that are deep to weathered shale of Cretaceous age.  They are moderately well drained, and very slowly permeable.  These soils are on broad ridges on the dissected plains.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils formed in alkaline residuum derived from interbedded shale and clay.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but range from 0 to 10 percent.",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for growing cotton, grain sorghums, and small grain, but more than half the acreage is now in pastures. Native vegetation is prairie grasses such as bluestems, indiangrass, switchgrass, and gramas, with scattered elm, hackberry, and mesquite trees.\nNote: Crockett and Axtell soils are close competitors.  Native vegetation of Crockett was dominantly prairie grasses whereas that of Axtell was trees with an understory of grasses.  Morphologically, Crockett soils are less acid and leached in the upper part of the Bt horizon than Axtell soils.  At present, this difference is attributed primarily to vegetation."
