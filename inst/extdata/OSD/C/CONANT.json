  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid in the surface and upper part of the subsoil horizons and very strongly acid through moderately alkaline in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  The rock fragments are about 80 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.  Some pedons are channery and flaggy.  Decayed limestone and calcareous shale fragments are present in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon in most pedons. These decayed fragments or \"ghosts\" are intact within the profile but are easily crushed when rubbed between the fingers.  Consistence is very friable or friable in the surface and upper part of the subsoil and friable or firm in the lower part of the subsoil  and in the substratum.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction throughout except in some pedons the B and C horizons have discontinuous pockets of loamy sand, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak to strong very fine to medium granular structure.\nWooded areas have an A horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is 1 to 3 inch thick.  These areas may have an E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3, that is 1 to 3 inch thick.\nThe Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, with value and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bh and Bs horizons have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or very fine or fine subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have weak thin to thick platy structure in the lower part of the Bs horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular, very fine to coarse subangular blocky or weak thin to thick platy structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The horizon is massive or it has weak to moderate, very fine or fine angular blocky, thin to thick platy, or primary prismatic structure."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Conant soils are on till plains and the lower slopes of till ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is dominantly 2 to 8 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from metamorphosed limestone and calcareous sandstone and shale. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 350 to 800 feet above mean sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. The classification is updated to Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Aquic Haplorthods with this revision to conform to the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 8th edition, 1998. The former classification was Fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Aquic Haplorthods.  The classification is questionable and additional studies are needed to determine the status of the spodic horizon.  The spodic horizon has been destroyed by cultural practices in many areas but is present in wooded and uneroded areas.  Conant soils are borderline between coarse-loamy and fine-loamy.  2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 17 inches (Bs horizon).\nc.  Aquic feature - mottles in the spodic horizon (Bs2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics are Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin Number 75, SCS characterization data, and composite data from the Field Appraisal of Resource Management Systems compiled by Dr. Paul R. Hepler, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Maine at Orono, Orono, Maine.\nThe Soil Interpretation Record number for the Conant series is ME0042.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
