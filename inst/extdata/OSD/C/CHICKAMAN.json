    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chickaman soils are on mountain slopes. Elevations are 4,500 to 6,000 feet. Slopes are 8 to 60 percent. These soils formed in material derived from micaceous schist. They have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters and moist springs. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 60 days."
