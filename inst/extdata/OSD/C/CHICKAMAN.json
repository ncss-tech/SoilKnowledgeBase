  "OVERVIEW": "The Chickaman series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material derived from micaceous schist. These soils have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer. Chickaman soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 8 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
