  "STATES": "IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caleb series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from glaciers.  These soils are on treads and risers of high stream terraces of major streams and their tributaries.  Slope ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.",
