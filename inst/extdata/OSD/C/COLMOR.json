The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 18 inches thick. The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. The B2 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam with less than 15 percent fine and/or coarse sand. The B3ca horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It contains 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate. The Cca horizon has value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. This horizon contains 20 to 30 percent calcium carbonate."

Oglala and Tripp soils have coarse-silty family control sections. Tilford soils have hue redder than 10YR in the B and C horizons. Ulysses soils have sola thinner than 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Colmor soils are on level to rolling uplands at elevations of 5,800 to 7,500 feet. The soils formed in 4 to 10 feet of moderately fine textured material weathered from shale. At the type location the climate is continental with average temperature of 48 degrees F. Annual rainfall is 14 to 17 inches with about 3/4 received during the period of April through September."
