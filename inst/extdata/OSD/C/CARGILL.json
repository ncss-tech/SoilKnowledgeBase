The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 44 degrees F.   The 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay, of which less than one-third is carbonate size.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 25 to 40 percent CaC03 equivalent.\nThe underlying bedrock is interbedded platy shale, siltstone, or mudstone and with lenses of hard sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cargill soils are nearly level to strongly rolling and are on sedimentary uplands at elevations of 3,200 to 4,300 feet.  They formed in material weathered from siltstone, shale and sandstone, and in places in thin surficial deposits of old alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls when the soil is not frozen.  The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 15 degrees to 25 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 65 degrees to 70 degrees F.   The (32 degrees F.) growing season is 105 to 135 days."
