  "OVERVIEW": "The Crookedflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and loess influenced slope alluvium. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
