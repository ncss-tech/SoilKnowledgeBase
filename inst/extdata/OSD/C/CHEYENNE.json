  "BYREV": "Rev. LGR",
  "REVDATE": "04/2005",
  "STATES": "CO,MT,NE,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheyenne series consists of moderately deep soils over sand and gravel. They are well drained, moderately over very rapidly permeable soils on stream terraces. They formed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous material. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
