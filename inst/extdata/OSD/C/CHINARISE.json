  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinarise series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Chinarise soils are on low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
