  "OVERVIEW": "The Clyde series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in 75 to 150 centimeters of loamy glacial outwash or erosional sediments and the underlying loamy till. These soils are on nearly level positions, swales and concave drainageways on interfluves on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.",
