  "OVERVIEW": "The Cumacho series consists of well drained soils that are deep to shale bedrock.  They formed in eolian material and slope alluvium derived from sandstone over residuum derived from shale.  Cumacho soils are on pediments. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
