  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cumacho soils are on footslopes and backslopes of pediments.  They formed in eolian materials and slope alluvium derived from sandstone over residuum weathered from the Cretaceous age Mancos Shale formation.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Devargas soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on treads of high stream terraces.  Penistaja soils very deep and occur on fan remnants. Riovista soils are sandy-skeletal and occur on low stream terraces.  Sandoval soils are shallow and occur on shoulders and backslopes.  Skyvillage soils are shallow to sandstone and occur on shoulders and backslopes."
