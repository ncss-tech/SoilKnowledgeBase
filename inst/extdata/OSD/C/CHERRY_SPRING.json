Eastval soils have neutral reaction in the argillic horizon and lack weak silica or durinodes above the duripan. Spasprey soils have A and Bt horizons that are 25 to 50 cm thick and more than 35 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Yody soils have an argillic horizon with more than 35 percent sand and a calcic horizon above the duripan.  Zaidy soils have a Bt horizon with a sodium absorption ratio of 6 to 13, lack a strongly alkaline lower Bt subhorizon and parent materials are not dominated by loess high in pyroclastics."
