  "OVERVIEW": "The Cherry Spring series consists of moderately deep to a strongly cemented duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Cherry Spring soils are on fan piedmont remnants.   Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
