  "BYREV": "Rev. PGM:JLD:LEK",
  "REVDATE": "02/2013",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cocodrie series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable, loamy soils. These soils are forming in loamy sediments dredged and pumped from canals or rivers or from land surfaces during construction of canals or waterways. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nA--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very fine sandy loam; few fine distinct yellowish brown mottles; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine and very fine roots; thin layer (1/2 inch) of very dark grayish brown very fine sandy loam on surface; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)\nC--3 to 65 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam; fine and medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) mottles that are few in the upper part and common in lower part; common fine and medium faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; thinly bedded throughout; very friable; many fine and medium roots, common coarse roots; common thin strata and clods of grayish brown silt loam and loamy fine sand; moderately alkaline."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where the value is 3, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 20 inches of the surface and some pedons have chroma of 2 dominant in the lower part. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Thin strata and small to large clods of coarser and/or finer textured materials range from few to common. Buried soils are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Soils in a similar family are the Adler, Bruin and Convent series. None of these soils formed in spoil materials or materials transported by man. Adler soils do not have C horizons that contain clods of varying textures. Bruin soils have a cambic horizon. Convent soils have an aquic moisture regime and are grayer throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cocodrie soils are on spoil banks adjacent to rivers and canals. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils are forming in thick, loamy sediments dredged and pumped from canals or rivers or from land surfaces during construction of canals or waterways. The climate is warm and humid. The mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 59 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are mainly the competing Bruin and Convent series and Commerce, Crevasse, Sharkey, and Sostien series. All of these soils, except the Sostien soils are on nearby undisturbed areas. Sostien soils are developing in spoil materials and have a fine textured control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability. An apparent water table ranges from 2 to 3 feet from the soil surface during late winter and early spring. These soils are subject to flooding unless protected."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have reverted to woodland and are used mainly for wildlife habitat. A few areas are used for pasture. Dominant tree species in woodland areas are sugarberry, eastern cottonwood, American sycamore, green ash, and boxelder."

    "section": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT",
