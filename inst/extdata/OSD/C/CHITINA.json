  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The particle size of the control section commonly is silt loam but includes mucky silt loam, silt and very fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper horizons, ranging to moderately alkaline in the contrasting substratum.\nThe A horizon matrix has moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  This horizon contains streaks and strata of varying thickness.  Mottles are commonly present. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A/C horizon when present has dominant moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; moist value of 2, 3, or 4; moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches, with thin strata of charcoal often present.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value moist of 2, 3, 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon, when present, has moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay, silty cay loam, or clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent subangular cobbles and pebbles.  Effervescence ranges from slightly to strongly.  Free carbonates are disseminated throughout."

Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 degrees to 27 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copper River and Kenny Lake series on the same landform.  Copper River soils are the permafrost counterpart of the Chitina series.  The organic mat of the Copper River soils is undisturbed, resulting in better insulation, lower soil temperature, and permafrost within the control section.  Kenny Lake soils are in similar positions but have lacustrine material within 40 inches."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Chitina soils have native vegetation of white spruce, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willows.  Most areas have been burned, resulting in the transition from Copper River to Chitina soils.  The successional state of vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history.  Small areas are cleared and used for small grains, grass, and vegetables."
