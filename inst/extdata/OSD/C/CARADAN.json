  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Chert fragments of gravel and cobble size range from few to about 15 percent of the soil surface.  Cracks more than 1 cm wide extend to depths of 20 to 30 inches are at some seasons during most years.  The soil is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and noncalcareous in the upper part and is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline and calcareous in the lower Bt horizon.  Soft concretions, films, and threads occur at depths below 12 inches but commonly within 28 inches. The COLE is 0.07 to 0.13 or more in some horizons or horizons 20 or more inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The texture is silty clay, clay, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Vertically oriented concretions, films, and threads of calcium carbonate range from 3 to 15 percent by volume in the lower part of the Bt.  The average clay content ranges from 50 to 60 percent.\nThe 2Bk  horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Vertically oriented concretions, films, and threads of calcium carbonate range from 15 to 40 percent by volume.  Textures are loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Benchley, Durant, Foraker,  and Flatonia   series in the same family and the similar Culp, Halletsville, Lofton, Normangee, Tabler, Tarpley, Topia, and Speck series.  Benchley soils are formed in clayey marine sediments, contain gray mottles in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are not effervescent within 30 inches of the surface.  Flatonia soils have sola thickness 40 to 60 inches over soft bedrocks.  Durant and Tabler soils have hues yellower than 10YR, also Tabler soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Foraker soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and are calcareous throughout.  Culp, Lofton, and Topia soils have mixed mineralogy, also Topia soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Halletsville soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons.  Normangee soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Tarpley and Speck soils have lithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caradan soils are on ancient stream terraces and erosional uplands.  Slopes are mostly less than 2 percent, but range to 3 percent.  The soil formed in a mantle of clay over calcareous, loamy earth.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 230 to 240, and the elevation ranges from 1000 to 1700 feet above sea level.  The annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 28 inches, and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 42 to 50."

The shallow, loamy Doss and Real soils are below on sideslopes above drains.  The deep, loamy Seawillow soils are below on similar or slightly lower stream terraces. The shallow, loamy Evant soils are on similar positions."
