  "OVERVIEW": "The Cobatus series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains adjacent to playas.  They formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine or playa sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is between 4 and 8 inches with relatively even distribution of precipitation with slight peaks in January and August.  The mean annual temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 210 days."
