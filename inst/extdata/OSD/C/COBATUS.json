  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is arid.  The winters are cool and the summers hot and dry.  The mean annual precipitation is between 4 and 8 inches with relatively even distribution of precipitation with slight peaks in January and August.  The mean annual temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 210 days."
