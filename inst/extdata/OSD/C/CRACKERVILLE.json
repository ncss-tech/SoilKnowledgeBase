  "OVERVIEW": "The Crackerville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, residuum and colluvium derived from granitic and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, escarpments, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
