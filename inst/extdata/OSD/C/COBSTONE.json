  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Rounded cobbles, pebbles and stones range from 25 to 50 percent in the A, E and BE horizons and from 35 to 80 percent in the  Bt, BC and C horizons.  The rock fragments are mostly sandstone and the dominate size is 3 to 10 inches across but some are as large as 30 inches across. Stones on the surface are more common in wooded areas where they have not been removed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have value of 3 in horizons less than 6 inches thick.  The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is the same as the A horizon.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, and sandy clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons have colors like the Bt horizon.  The textures are loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand."

The Avant and Bigfork soils are underlain by hard chert tilted at 20 to 60 degrees from the horizontal.  The Lillington soils formed in gravelly alluvium on high terraces of the Coastal Plain.  The Saffell soils formed in loamy and gravelly sediments on Coastal Plains uplands.  The Steprock soils formed in residuum and colluvium and are on hillsides and ridges.  The Subligna soils have a high content of chert fragments.  The Zafra soils are underlain with interbedded sandstone and shale that is tilted 20 to 60 degrees from the horizontal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in loamy local alluvium with a high content of sandstone cobbles and stones.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 53 inches near the type location."

The Sequatchie soils are on adjacent low stream terraces, have less than 35 percent coarse fragments and have a dark surface layer more than 6 inches thick.\nThe moderately well drained Whitwell soils are on slightly lower lying stream terraces adjoining this soil and have less than 15 percent fragments."

Laboratory data for the typical pedon was obtained from the National Soil Survey Laboratory:  S84TN-007-003.  Data is also available for the control section for two additional pedons: S84TN-007-001 and S84TN-007-002.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 12 to 34 inches (Bt horizon.)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
