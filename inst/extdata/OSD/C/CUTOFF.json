  "OVERVIEW": "The Cutoff series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately perm-eable soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate.  These soils are on foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes of 6 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
