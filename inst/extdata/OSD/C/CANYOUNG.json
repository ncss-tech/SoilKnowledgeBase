  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canyoung soils are on mountains. They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and calcareous shale. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,055 to 3,340 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
