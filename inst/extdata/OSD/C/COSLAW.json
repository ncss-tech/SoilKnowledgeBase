    "content": "REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1744.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the surface to 6 inches (A and upper part of Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 18 inches (Bw horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 18 inches (Bw horizon); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 18 to 31 inches (Cr horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 31 inches (R horizon).  Coslaw soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Ashy-skeletal, glassy, shallow Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Ashy-skeletal, glassy, shallow Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
