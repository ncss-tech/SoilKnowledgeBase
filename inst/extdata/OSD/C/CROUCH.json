  "OVERVIEW": "The Crouch series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  Crouch soils are on mountainous uplands and have slopes of 8 and 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 80 inches.  The solum is 40 to 65 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 55 degrees F.  Soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches usually is moist in some part from about November 15 to late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent to a depth of more than 10 inches, decreases regularly, and is less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  Base saturation is 60 to 75 percent throughout the profile.  Rock fragments, mostly as fine gravel, make up less than 15 percent of the profile.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown, grayish brown, dark grayish brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2). It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and is slightly or medium acid.  This horizon has weak, granular or subangular blocky structure or is massive and is soft or slightly hard when dry.\nThe B2 horizon is light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown or pale brown (10YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 6/3). It is loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  This horizon is massive or it has weak angular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly or medium acid."
