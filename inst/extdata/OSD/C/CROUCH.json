  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 80 inches.  The solum is 40 to 65 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 55 degrees F.  Soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches usually is moist in some part from about November 15 to late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent to a depth of more than 10 inches, decreases regularly, and is less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  Base saturation is 60 to 75 percent throughout the profile.  Rock fragments, mostly as fine gravel, make up less than 15 percent of the profile.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown, grayish brown, dark grayish brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2). It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and is slightly or medium acid.  This horizon has weak, granular or subangular blocky structure or is massive and is soft or slightly hard when dry.\nThe B2 horizon is light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown or pale brown (10YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 6/3). It is loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  This horizon is massive or it has weak angular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly or medium acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches, about 1/2 falling as snow.  The average January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The average frost free season is 135 to 225 days."
