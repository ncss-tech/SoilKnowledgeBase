  "OVERVIEW": "The Canutio series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy, gravelly, and stony alluvium and sediments.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, and on valley floors of wide arroyos in mountainous areas.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.",
