  "OVERVIEW": "The Carlinton series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils on hills and ridges on basalt plateaus or on mountain slopes and canyon benches. They formed in material weathered from loess and reworked loess with an influence of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low through the fragipan. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
