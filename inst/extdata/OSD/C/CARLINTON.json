    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Carlinton soils are on loess-covered hills, mountains, basalt plateaus and benches. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.

The average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 22 to 45 inches (559 to 1143 mm). The average frost-free period is from 80 to 125 days."
