  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock exceed 60 inches.  Amount of angular fragments of chert or of rounded gravel ranges from none to about 10 percent or rarely 15 percent by volume in each horizon.  Dark colored concretions\nrange from few to common in each horizon.  The soil is strongly acid or medium except the surface layer where limed and the layer in the lower part of the solum which ranges through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 2.5YR 3/4, 2/4) silt loam or loam.  It ranges to dark red (2.5YR 3/6; 10YR 3/6) silty clay loam or clay loam where severely eroded.\nThe B1 horizon is dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), dusky red (10YR 3/3, 3/4), or dark red (2.5YR 3/6; 10YR 3/6) clay loam or silty clay loam.  The B21t through B23t horizons are dark red (2.5YR 3/6; 10R 3/6), dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), or dusky red (10R 3/3, 3/4) clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam marginal to clay. The dark red, dusky red or dark reddish brown colors extend to depths greater than 40 inches.  The B24t horizon is firm or very firm clay or clay loam which is variable in color.  In addition, to the colors given for the B21t to B23t horizons it includes red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8; 10R 4/6, 4/8) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8) or mottled brown, yellow, and red.  Average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the B horizon ranges between about 35 and 60 percent.  Clay content increases as depth increases."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Davidson, Decatur, Dewey, Etowah, Greenville, Hiwassee, Maury, Pembroke, Rabun, and Tellico series.  All of these soils except Pembroke and Maury soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Dewey soils have values of 4 or more in the argillic horizon.  The Etowah and Pembroke soils have less than 35 percent clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and the upper part of the argillic of these two soils is yellowish red or reddish brown.  Maury soils lack dark red or dark reddish brown colors in the upper part of the argillic horizon and the Ap horizon has color value of 4.  Rabun soils have soil temperature of less than 59 degrees.  Tellico soils have oxidic mineralogy."
