The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe particle size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent clay.  Content of rock fragments is 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bw and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam, but averages more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.  The Bw horizon doesn't meet the definition of a cambic horizon."
