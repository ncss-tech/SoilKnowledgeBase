  "OVERVIEW": "The Cessna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Cessna soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe particle size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent clay.  Content of rock fragments is 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bw and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam, but averages more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.  The Bw horizon doesn't meet the definition of a cambic horizon."
