Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,435 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C., mean summer temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.; and the frost-free period is 95 to 115 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than are present today.  Entrenchment of stream channels due to normal meandering has caused the water table to drop below 120 cm.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 120 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between February and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  A drained phase is recognized."
