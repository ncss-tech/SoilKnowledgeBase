  "OVERVIEW": "Califon series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils formed either in old till or on driftless landscapes in the Northern Piedmont in colluvium from granitic gneiss on upland flats or concave slope positions.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 45 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness 35 to 60 inches. Depth to top of the fragipan ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to hard granitic gneiss bedrock ranges from 6 feet to 20 feet. The particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Unlimed reaction ranges from moderately to slightly acid near the surface and strongly to very strongly acid in the lower part of the solum and the C horizon.  Individual horizons within the solum or C horizons have up to 25 percent, mostly subangular or angular gravel, cobbles or stones.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR with values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  In uncultivated areas, thin A horizons are dominantly very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  The A horizons are loam or gravelly loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bt and Btx horizons have hues of 10YR through 5YR, values of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Redoximorphic features are few, common or many, fine or medium, distinct or prominent and have hues of 10YR through 5YR, values of 5 through 7 and chromas of 1 through 8, but 2 chroma is absent in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Very dark manganese stains are common.  The Bt horizons are loam, clay loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam.  Textures of the Btx horizons are sandy clay loam, sandy loam, loam and clay loam.  Though clay in any one subhorizon may range from 18 to 40 percent, the Bt horizon averages from 27 to 35 percent and the Btx horizon from 18 to 27 percent.  Clay films are common on secondary ped faces but are few in some subhorizons. It has weak or moderate, medium subangular blocky structure.  The Bt horizons are friable or firm.  Structure in the upper parts of the Btx is weak very coarse prismatic parting to weak or moderate, thick or very thick platy.\nThe C horizons are similar to the Bt and Btx horizons but have more redoximorphic features.  The C horizons are sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam or loamy sand.  In pedons where the C horizon extends into saprolite, many fine or very fine angular pebbles are present."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annandale, Delassus, Meckesville, Tonti, and Watson series. Annandale soils lack iron depletions within a depth of 40 inches.  Delassus soils formed in loess and underlying residuum weathered from granite or similar igneous rocks. Meckesville soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan.  Tonti soils have bedrock at depths of less than 6 feet.  Watson soils lack rock fragments dominated by sandstone, siltstone, shale or quartzite."

The well drained Annandale, Gladstone, and Parker soils lack low chroma redox features in the sola.  The poorly drained Cokesbury soils have low chroma redox features immediately below the Ap or A horizon and the Gladstone and Parker soils lack fragipans.  Parker soils are skeletal and lack an argillic horizon as well."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 03/2005 revision places Califon soils in an active family based on sampled pedon 83NJ019001, analyzed by the NSSL. The pedon description was updated to currently used horizon nomenclature and redoximorphic feature terminology. Additionally, competing series were also updated.\n10/2007 revision distinguishes two landscape positions and parent materials on which Califon occurs: old till of North-central New Jersey and East-central Pennsylvania (MLRA 144A/140) and driftless colluvial landscapes of the Northern Piedmont (MLRA148). Associated with terminal moraines, these landscapes and parent materials intermix geographically.  Also, this revision includes competing series and other sections on the OSD were revised and updates this soil to the 10th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Minor revisions to nomenclature within the description were done. This pedon has been entered into NASIS and has pedon ID# 81NJ019001.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 inches (Ap and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 50 inches (BA and Bt horizons\nFragipan--the zone from 23 to 50 inches having very firm moist consistence (Btx horizons)\nRevised 4/81-CFE, KPW, CFJ; 04/2005-MD\nPrevious revision  5/2005 MDJ-DHK-ART-JWB\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
