  "OVERVIEW": "The Cherryhill series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from tuffaceous sandstone. These soils are on uplands and have nearly level to steep slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.\nSOIL FAMILY:  Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days or more within the 4 month period following the summer solstice. They are also moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the winter solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 55 degrees F. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments commonly are absent in the solum but stones and cobbles in some pedons. The soils are neutral or slightly acid in the upper part and slightly or medium acid in the lower part. They have less than 1 percent organic matter at depths of less than 10 inches.\nThe A horizon is silt loam or loam.\nThe B1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam or silt loam. The B2t horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam in the upper part and sandy clay loam or clay loam in the lower part with 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand."

Boomer, Cohasset, Crozier and Musick soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the argillic horizon. Cle Elum soils are less than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Cohasset soils have base saturation of 35 to 50 percent. Crozier soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Five soils have dry value of 6 in the A horizon, and medium acid in the upper part of the solum, and strongly to very strongly acid in the lower part of the solum and C horizon, and commonly have 5Y hue in the B and C horizons and overlie greenish breccia bedrock. Holland soils have hue redder than 10YR, have base saturation of 35 to 50 percent in the A horizon and 45 to 75 percent in the B horizon and have more than 25 percent medium to very coarse sand in the argillic horizon. Hood soils have silt loam or loam textures throughout the solum, have moist value of 4 and dry value of 6 at depths of less than 10 inches and have contains of gray silt and sand on faces of peds in the lower part of the B2t horizon and in the C horizon. Hotaw soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have 16 to 26 percent coarse sand in the argillic horizon. Kalama soils have variegated colors with chroma of 2 through 4 and coarse sand in the argillic horizon. Kalama soils have variegated colors with chroma of 2 through 4 and have gravelly clay loam and gravelly sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Musick soils have more than 25 percent medium and coarse sands in the argillic horizons. Stump Springs soils have more than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sands. Varelum soils are neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in a thin silty alluvial deposit over colluvial materials weathered from semiconsolidated and consolidated tuffaceous sandstone. Summers are warm and dry with an average July temperature of 72 degrees F. Winters are cool and moist with an average January temperature of 33 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 51 degrees to 53 degrees F. Precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches annually. The average frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 140 to 180 days."
