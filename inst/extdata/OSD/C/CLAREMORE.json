Soils in similar families are the Caspiana, Catoosa, Clareson, Collinsville, Dardanelle, Deepwater, Fitzhugh, Lenapah, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Nowata, Okay, Shidler, and Tiptonville series.  Caspiana, Catoosa, Clareson, Dardanelle, Deepwater, Fitzhugh, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Nowata, Okay, and Tiptonville\nsoils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the\nsurface.  Collinsville and Shidler soils do not have B2t horizons.  Lenapah soils have a clayey control section and montmorillonitic mineralogy."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Claremore soils are on nearly level or gently sloping convex ridgetops or upland flats in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in material\nweathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is\nmoist, subhumid, or humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from\n33 to 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 57 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 50 to 70."

Catoosa, Lenapah, Lula, Newtonia, Nowata, and Shidler\nsoils occur on broad ridgetops.  Newtonia and Summit soils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.  In\naddition, Summit soils have more than 35 percent clay content in\nthe control section and occur mainly on side slopes below the ridgetops."
