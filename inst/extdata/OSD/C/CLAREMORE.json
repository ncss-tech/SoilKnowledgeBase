  "OVERVIEW": "The Claremore series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils that formed in material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on nearly level\nto gently sloping convex uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",

Soils in similar families are the Caspiana, Catoosa, Clareson, Collinsville, Dardanelle, Deepwater, Fitzhugh, Lenapah, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Nowata, Okay, Shidler, and Tiptonville series.  Caspiana, Catoosa, Clareson, Dardanelle, Deepwater, Fitzhugh, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Nowata, Okay, and Tiptonville\nsoils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the\nsurface.  Collinsville and Shidler soils do not have B2t horizons.  Lenapah soils have a clayey control section and montmorillonitic mineralogy."
