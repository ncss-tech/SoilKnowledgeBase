The very poorly drained Cintrona soils are on similar to slightly lower positions.  The well drained Cortada and San Anton soils are on higher positions and have fine-loamy subsoils.  The excessively drained Jacaguas soils are on higher positions, are loamy-skeletal, and are noncalcareous.  Machuelo soils are on similar positions but do not have a mollic epipedon."
