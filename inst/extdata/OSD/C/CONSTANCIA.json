  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Constancia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on flood plains.  They formed in fine-textured sediments derived from volcanic and limestone rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The excessively drained Jacaguas soils are on higher positions, are loamy-skeletal, and are noncalcareous.  Machuelo soils are on similar positions but do not have a mollic epipedon."
