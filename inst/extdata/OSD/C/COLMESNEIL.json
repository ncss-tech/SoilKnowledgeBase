  "OVERVIEW": "The Colmesneil Series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable, sandy upland soils that formed in thick sandy sediments of marine deposits. These soils are on broad nearly level to moderately sloping interfluves with concave or plain surfaces of the Willis and Whitsett Formation.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 inch) and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
