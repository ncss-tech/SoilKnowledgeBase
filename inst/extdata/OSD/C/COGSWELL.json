  "OVERVIEW": "The Cogswell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Cogswell soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans, broad swales or valley plains and on old lake margins and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent, but are dominantly less than one percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks with some influence from sedimentary rocks. Cogswell soils are at elevations of 4,000 to 4,600 feet in a warm semiarid continental climate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 67 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 155 to 230 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains."
