  "OVERVIEW": "The Copeman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in high energy alluvium from mixed sources. Copeman soils are on relict fan aprons, pediments, and dissected terraces. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and ranges from 8 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June. The frost-free season is estimated to range from 100 to 125 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and local air drainage."
