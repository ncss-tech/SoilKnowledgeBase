  "OVERVIEW": "Clough series are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that occur on old terraces formed in gravelly alluvium that is high in quartz and cherts derived mostly from conglomerates and other sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are gently undulating.  Mean annual rainfall is 30 to 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils become dry in the moisture control section about June 15 and remain dry until about September 15.\nThe Clough soils have brown, medium acid, gravelly loam A horizons that rest abruptly on very strongly acid very gravelly clay B2t horizons.  The C horizons are very strongly acid strongly cemented duripans.  Structure is very weak or the soils are massive.\nThe A horizons range in color from brown to reddish yellow (10YR, 7.5YR).  Texture ranges from gravelly fine sandy loam to loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to medium acid.  The structure usually is weak granular but in some pedons the soils are massive.  They are 10 to 14 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizons range in color from light yellowish brown (10YR) to reddish yellow (7.5YR); in texture from gravelly or cobbly clay to gravelly clay loam.  Structure usually is weak subangular blocky but in some pedons the soils are massive.  Reaction is very strongly to strongly acid.\nThe C horizons are very strongly acid, very gravelly clay loams or clays that are strongly cemented or indurated."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Clough soils are similar to the Red Bluff, Redding, Igo and Tuscan soils.  The Red Bluff soils lack abrupt A-B boundaries and duripans, and have hues of 2.5YR or 10R (dry) in the B2t horizons.  The Redding soils are redder (5YR and 2.5YR hues) and lack very gravelly B2t horizons.  The Igo soils lack argillic horizons.  The Tuscan soils are medium to slightly acid and lack very gravelly B2t horizons."

The sediments are gravelly alluvium that is high in quartz and cherts derived mostly from conglomerates and other sedimentary rocks.  The climate is subhumid with mean annual rainfall of 30 to 40 inches, with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, average January temperature about 47 degrees F, and average July temperature about 75 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."
