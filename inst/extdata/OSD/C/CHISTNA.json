    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F. Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 1 to 3 inches.  Thickness of the loess cap is 1 to 6 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 14 inches.  Texture in the control section includes sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand with a weighted average of less than 50 percent very fine sand.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid in the solum and moderately or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has moist hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 3 through 6. Texture includes silt loam fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent with 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 2 through 4; and moist chroma of 0 through 3.  Textures include loamy fine sand, fine sand, and sand.  Pockets of fine sandy loam and loam are common.\nCoarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 10 percent gravel."
