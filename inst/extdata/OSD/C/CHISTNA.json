  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chistna series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash and sandy strandline deposits.  Chistna soils are on lacustrine terraces glacial outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 27 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Thickness of the loess cap is 1 to 6 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 14 inches.  Texture in the control section includes sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand with a weighted average of less than 50 percent very fine sand.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid in the solum and moderately or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has moist hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 3 through 6. Texture includes silt loam fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent with 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 2 through 4; and moist chroma of 0 through 3.  Textures include loamy fine sand, fine sand, and sand.  Pockets of fine sandy loam and loam are common.\nCoarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 10 percent gravel."
