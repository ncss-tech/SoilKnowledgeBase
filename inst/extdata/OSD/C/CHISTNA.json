  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F. Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 1 to 3 inches.  Thickness of the loess cap is 1 to 6 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 14 inches.  Texture in the control section includes sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand with a weighted average of less than 50 percent very fine sand.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid in the solum and moderately or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has moist hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 3 through 6. Texture includes silt loam fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent with 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 2 through 4; and moist chroma of 0 through 3.  Textures include loamy fine sand, fine sand, and sand.  Pockets of fine sandy loam and loam are common.\nCoarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 10 percent gravel."

The climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm winters.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."
