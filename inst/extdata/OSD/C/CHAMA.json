  "STATES": "MT,ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chama series consists of well drained soils formed in materials weathered from soft siltstone, mudstone and shale on uplands.  These soils are moderately deep to soft siltstone, mudstone or shale.  These soils are moderately or moderately slowly permeable.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",
