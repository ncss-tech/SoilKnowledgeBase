  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is more than 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. A seasonal perched water table is encountered at approximately 8 inches.  The depth to a fragipan ranges from 8 to 30 inches.  The fragipan normally is part of the argillic horizon, but in some pedons it overlies the argillic.  Rock fragments of subrounded gravels comprise 0 to 5 percent of the soil profile.  The particle size control section contains 7 to 14 percent fine sand or coarser material by weight.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon, has hue of 10 YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR of 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It normally has iron depletions on the ped faces.\nThe B't horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  It normally has iron accumulations and iron depletions on ped faces and in pore linings."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clapham soils are on natural levees of high river terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent and are convex or linear.  The soils are forming in transported parent materials derived from old alluvium that washed from uplands underlain by limestone, granitic rocks and metamorphosed schist.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F."
