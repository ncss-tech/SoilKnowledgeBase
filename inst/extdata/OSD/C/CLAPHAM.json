  "REVDATE": "01/2006",
  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Clapham series are very deep and moderately well drained.  They formed in old alluvium deposited from uplands underlain by mixed sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks.  They are on nearly level to gently sloping convex and linear river terrace positions.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

A seasonal perched water table is encountered at approximately 8 inches.  The depth to a fragipan ranges from 8 to 30 inches.  The fragipan normally is part of the argillic horizon, but in some pedons it overlies the argillic.  Rock fragments of subrounded gravels comprise 0 to 5 percent of the soil profile.  The particle size control section contains 7 to 14 percent fine sand or coarser material by weight.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon, has hue of 10 YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.
