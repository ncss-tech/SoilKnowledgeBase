  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mineral solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 25 to 50 cm. Rock fragments in the form of channers and gravel range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum. Pararock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum. Reaction in unlimed areas is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface and strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil. Average clay content in the particle-size control section is 8 to 15 percent.\nForested areas may have an Oe horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Ap, or A horizon where present, has moist hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry colors are hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have 2Cr horizons with variegated colors in a wide spectrum of hues, values, and chroma. It is extremely weakly to moderately cemented. It constitutes paralithic materials."

The soils formed in glacial till derived from limestone-interbedded phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone, and pelitic limestone. Surface stones and boulders range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 50 to 230 meters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1135 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 115 to 155 days."

The moderately well drained Boothbay, the somewhat poorly drained Pushaw, and the poorly drained Swanville soils formed in very deep glaciomarine or glaciolacustrine sediments. They are on adjacent lake plains or marine terraces at slightly lower elevations. The very deep moderately well drained Chesuncook soils, and the very deep somewhat poorly drained Telos soils formed in lodgment till, and are on side slopes and toe slopes. The moderately deep well drained Penobscot soils are on linear to slightly convex summits and side slopes. The deep well drained Sebasticook soils are on linear to slightly convex side slopes. The moderately deep moderately well drained Wassookeag soils are on linear to slightly concave summits and side slopes. The very deep, somewhat poorly drained Kenduskeag soils are on footslopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series is named for the village of Corinna, in southwestern Penobscot County. It is part of a proposed suite of soils that includes Sebasticook, Penobscot, and Wassookeag. They developed in till that is shallow to very deep to calcareous metasedimentary bedrock of the Waterville and Sangerville Formations in central Maine, MLRA 144B. In comparison to other soils of the region they have a higher base saturation, water-holding capacity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. They are considered agriculturally productive, particularly for potatoes and small grains and corn.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 22 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon -- the zone from a depth of 22 to 33 cm (Bw horizon).\n3. Lithic contact -- at a depth of 33 cm (R layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Primary characterization samples from pedon 03N0757, samples 03N03765, 03N03768, from Penobscot County, Maine, samples by NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 08/04.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
