  "OVERVIEW": "The Comfort series consists of soils that are shallow to indurated limestone bedrock. These well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum derived from dolomitic limestone of Lower Cretaceous period. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on ridges on dissected plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).",
