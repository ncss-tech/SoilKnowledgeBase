  "OVERVIEW": "The Clevescove series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  Clevescove soils are on mountains side slopes and have slopes of 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but is dry within the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to paralithic bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  The O horizon is 1 to 4 inches thick.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 1 to 3 dry.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.  Bulk density is 0.90 to 1.00 grams/cubic centimeter.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or loam with 5 to 25 percent gravel.  It is strongly or very strongly acid.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It has 7 to 18 percent clay.  It has 10 to 35 percent gravel.  It is strong or very strongly acid.  It has 0.5 to 1.0 percent organic matter."
