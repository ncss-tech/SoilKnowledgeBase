  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 19 to 24 inches thick, and is mildly to moderately calcareous. The moisture control section is usually dry for more than half the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. The driest period id between late September and May. The mean annual soil temperature is 55 degrees to 58 degrees F. The 10- to 40-inch section is loam, heavy loam or clay loam with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and 20 to 33 percent clay. The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 3 dry and moist. The B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure. The Cca horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 8 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5 dry and moist. It has 30 to 50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Some pedons contain a few caliche pebbles and loam strata in the Cca horizon or below it."
