  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cewat soils are on beach terraces and rock pediments.  They are adjacent to margins of plateaus that were inundated by Pleistocene lakes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,265 to 1,340 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
