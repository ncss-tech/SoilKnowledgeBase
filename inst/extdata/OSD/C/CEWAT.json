  "OVERVIEW": "The Cewat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Cewat soils are on beach terraces and rock pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,265 to 1,340 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
