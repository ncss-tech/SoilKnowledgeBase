  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinchin series consist of very shallow and shallow well drained soils with moderately slow permeability. Chinchin soils are on hills and escarpments on structural benches and are formed in residuum and colluvium from shale. Slopes range from 25 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",
