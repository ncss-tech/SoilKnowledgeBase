Buried A horizons are common. Some pedons have gravelly strata or strata of ashy silty clay loam, ashy silt loam, clay, ashy loam, ashy very fine sandy loam, or ashy sandy loam.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.  Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 20 to 30 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction and (Al +  Fe, % by ammonium oxalate) x 60) + % volcanic glass is greater than 30.\nA horizons\nHue: 10YR through 5Y.\nValue: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 0 through 3 in the upper part and 0 through 2 in the lower part.\nRelict redoximorphic features: Few to many, fine or medium, distinct or prominent zones of iron or manganese accumulation either lining pores or as masses within the matrix.\nVolcanic glass: Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 20 to 30 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction\nC horizons\nHue: 10YR through 5Y.\nValue: 5 through 8 dry, 2 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 0 through 2.\nStructure: Prismatic or is massive.\nTexture: mainly ashy clay loam but includes ashy sandy loam to ashy silty clay loam.\nConsistence: Slightly hard or hard dry, very friable or friable moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chug soils occur on stream terraces.  Prior to historical incision by stream channel entrenchment these soils occurred on floodplains.  They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials (glassy volcanic ash). Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,502 to 2,221 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 81 cm (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A2 horizon, A3, C1 and part of the Ab horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:   These soils exhibit characteristics of historic soil saturation as evidenced by relict redoximorphic features.  Incision by stream channel entrenchment has removed the zone of saturation from these soils as evidenced by depth to current stream that is commonly confined within sheer vertical walls.  This historical drainage is not considered artificial (in other words upon removal of disturbances or practices that contributed to drainage, aquic conditions would not return) and does not allow for application of an aquic soil moisture regime to the taxonomic classification of this soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
