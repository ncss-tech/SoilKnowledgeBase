  "OVERVIEW": "The Chug series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials. Chug soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials (glassy volcanic ash). Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,502 to 2,221 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 81 cm (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A2 horizon, A3, C1 and part of the Ab horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:   These soils exhibit characteristics of historic soil saturation as evidenced by relict redoximorphic features.  Incision by stream channel entrenchment has removed the zone of saturation from these soils as evidenced by depth to current stream that is commonly confined within sheer vertical walls.  This historical drainage is not considered artificial (in other words upon removal of disturbances or practices that contributed to drainage, aquic conditions would not return) and does not allow for application of an aquic soil moisture regime to the taxonomic classification of this soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
