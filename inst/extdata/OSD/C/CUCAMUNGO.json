  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crispy, Grandridge, Pinew, Pinwheeler, Quopant, and Trailamp series.\nCrispy soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel (5 to 75 mm diameter) and have rock fragments that are metamorphic rocks such as schist or gneiss.  Grandridge soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer due to convection storms.  Pinew soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel (5 to 75 mm diameter) and have paralithic materials of weathered volcanic rock in the series control section.  Pinwheeler soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control secion. Quopant soils have rock fragments that are mainly larger than 5 mm in diameter, have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon, and have paralithic materials that are weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section.  Trailamp soils have rock fragments that are mainly larger than 5 mm in diameter, have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm, and have paralithic materials of siltstone or shale in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cucamungo soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,840 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

Sylvaniam soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic and calcic horizons, and carbonatic mineralogy.  Tulecan soils have an aridic moisture regime and a mesic temperature regime."
