  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Most pedons have a few angular sandstone fragments in the solum, but range from a few to about 30 percent in the substratum. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 3 or less. Fine-earth texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or rarely silt loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Fine-earth texture is clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the BA horizon. Some pedons have BC or CB horizons overlying a C horizon or bedrock.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10 YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Fine-earth texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe Cr horizon is commonly weakly demented sandstone, but grades laterally to rippable siltstone or shale in some areas.\nThe R horizon is hard sandstone bedrock, but is more fractured on some exposures."

Ramsey soils are loamy. Varilla soils are loamy-skeletal. Hartsells and Jefferson soils have argillic horizons. Helechawa, Jefferson and Varilla soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Ramsey and Totz soils are shallow. Hartsells soils are thermic. None of these soils have an umbric epipedon."
