  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Content of rock fragments is 0 to 35 percent, by volume, in the A, Ap, and BA horizons, and 0 to 15 percent, by volume, in the Bt and BC, and 0 to 50 percent, by volume,  in the C horizons. They commonly are from crystalline rocks. The soil is strongly acid to slightly acid except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Value of 3 is restricted to A horizons less than 4 inches thick. It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Eroded horizons may be silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Many pedons have a subhorizon with a value of 3.  High chroma mottles and dark streaks or stains occur in some pedons. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  High chroma mottles and dark streaks or stains are in some pedons. It is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is highly variable and commonly contains shades of red, brown, and yellow. Generally it does not have a dominant matrix color. The C horizon is loam, silt loam, or clay loam and may contain 5 to 50 percent weathered crystalline rock fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Badin, Catharpin, Cecil, Davidson, Fluvanna, Gaston, Georgeville, Lloyd, Mayodan, Mecklenburg, Nanford, Pacolet, Tarrus, Uwharrie, and Vance series are in closely related families.  All of these soils are in a fine family.  In addition, Badin soils have paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the solum.  Mecklenburg soils have mixed mineralogy. Davidson soils are dark red throughout and the solum is greater than 60 inches.  Fluvanna, Nanford, and Vance soils have hue of 5YR or yellower in the upper part of the Bt horizon. Gaston soils have a dark surface layer. Lloyd soils are dark red throughout the upper 20 inches and are kandic. Mayodan soils formed in Triassic Basin sediments and do not allow rhodic colors in the Bt horizon. Tarrus soils have paralithic contact between 40 to 60 inches. Uwharrie soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands of the Piedmont Plateau. Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 15 percent but range from about 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from mixed mafic and felsic crystalline rocks. The average annual temperature ranges from about 59 degrees F to 65 degrees F and the average annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 48 inches."

Enon soils are not red and have slow permeability. Iredell soils have mixed mineralogy and a very high shrink swell potential. Madison soils are fine and contain many flakes of mica. Poindexter soils are fine-loamy."
