  "OVERVIEW": "The Cache series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  The Cache soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F.",

The soluble salt content ranges from 2 to 5 percent above 30 inches, and decreases with depth below 30 inches in some pedons. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 20 to 90 percent. Reaction ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline. Depth to water table fluctuates, but is typically between 10 to 40 inches; some areas are ponded at times. Mottles are at some depth between 20 and 40 inches.\nThe average annual soil temperature is more than 47 degrees F.\nThe Az horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Cz horizon have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4."

Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in fine textured sediments, mainly from shale and limestone. The climate is dry subhumid to semiarid. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 49 degrees F., and mean summer air temperature is 65 degrees to 70 degrees F. The freeze-free period is 110 to 160 days. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 18 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nSalic horizon - from 0 to 39 inches (Az, Cz1 and Cz2 horizons).\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".  Prior to this review of the series the last time it was looked at was in 1971.  A number of properties related to soil wetness need to be established with additional field data.  Salic horizons need to be dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section in normal years.  The NASIS data lists a water table from May to October which may not allow for a period of dryness.  In the database the range of water table depths is 0 to 36 inches and the drainage class is poor with no ponding.  The current series range has a water table from 10 to 40 inches, includes poor and somewhat poorly drained classes, and includes ponding.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
