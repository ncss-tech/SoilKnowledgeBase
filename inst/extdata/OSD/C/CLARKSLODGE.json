  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarkslodge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum from granitoid and metamorphic rock. These soils are on ancient landslides, moraines, and mountain slopes. Slope is 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches (940 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F (8.4 degrees C).",
