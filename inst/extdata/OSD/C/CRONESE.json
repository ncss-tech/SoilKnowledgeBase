Algerita soils are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section from for more than 20 days, cumulative, between July and September. Grapevine soils have an accumulation of gypsum in the substratum. Kinley have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 40 percent within the particle size control section and receive up to 12 inches of precipitation."

The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 340 days."

Arizo and Cajon soils have sandy-skeletal and sandy particle-size control sections, respectively, and are found in inset fans. Crosgrain soils are on ballenas and fan remnants, have a loam-skeletal particle-size control section, and are shallow to a duripan. Coyote soils are found on similar landscape positions as well as summits and upper side slopes of nearby hills, have a sandy particle-size control section and a durinodic layer. Popups soils are on fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and are 20 to 40 inches to a weak or moderately cemented duripan."
