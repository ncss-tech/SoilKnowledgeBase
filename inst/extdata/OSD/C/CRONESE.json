  "OVERVIEW": "The Cronese series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rock. The Cronese soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64.5 degrees F).",

Coyote soils are found on similar landscape positions as well as summits and upper side slopes of nearby hills, have a sandy particle-size control section and a durinodic layer. Popups soils are on fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and are 20 to 40 inches to a weak or moderately cemented duripan."
