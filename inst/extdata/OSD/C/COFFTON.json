  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The particle size control section averages from 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.  Redox accumulations are throughout the profile below the A horizon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are the matrix color below the A horizon in most pedons.  Aquic conditions occur at a depth of 1 to 2 feet for some time in most years.\nThe Ap and A horizon have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2,5Y and value of 4 to 6.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3.  It is silt loam.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or silt loam with few thin strata of loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand."

The moderately well drained Arenzville soils and the somewhat poorly drained Orion soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is recent light colored silty alluvium over a dark colored buried soil.  The somewhat poorly drained Curran soils are nearby on low terraces above the flood plain.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Ettrick soils are in lower positions on the floodplain."
