They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks over residuum weathered from diatomite or siliceous siltstone.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1280 to 1829 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
