  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Connleyhills soils are on lava plateaus. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,325 to 1,590 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 200 to 300 mm but may range to 400 mm in some areas.  The mean annual air temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
