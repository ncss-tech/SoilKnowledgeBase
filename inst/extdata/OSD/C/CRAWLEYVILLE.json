Ayrshire and Whitaker soils have a reaction that is less acid than strongly acid in the lower part of the series control section.  Capac soils are less than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon.  Digby, Jimtown and Sleeth soils have more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section.  Mitiwanga and Shadeland soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches.  Mongle soils have 5 to 50 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Warnut (T) soils are in a drier soil climate"
