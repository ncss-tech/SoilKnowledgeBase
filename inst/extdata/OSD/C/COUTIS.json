The control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has 13 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments, mainly less than 3 inches in diameter, range from 0 to 15 percent in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nA Bw horizon is present in about half the pedons and has the same range as the A except dry value may be 6 and moist value may be 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline."

Aycab soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Cinderspring soils have a lithologic discontinuity consisting mostly of cinders. Earcree, Foxvire, Gardner's Fork, Hailman, and Razorba soils have over 15 percent rock fragments throughout the control section.  Moonlight soils have a cambic horizon.  Naz soils have less than 13 percent clay in the particle size control section  Shook soils have granite bedrock at 30 to 50 inches.  Skyway soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Taral soils have mean annual soil temperatures 32 to 35 degrees F.  Tosp soils are not dry 45 or more consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice."
