  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarkspoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over loess on rises of plains and on shoulders of hills. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 615 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.",
