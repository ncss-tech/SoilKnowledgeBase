  "OVERVIEW": "The Capistrano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary or granitic sources. Capistrano soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains in small valleys. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. at depth of 20 inches and the soil temperature is usually not below 47 degrees F. at any time. The soil between depths of 8 and 25 inches is continuously dry in all parts from late April or May until late October and is usually moist in some part all the rest of the year. The 10- to 40-inch control section and usually all parts of the profile are sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam and have less than 18 percent clay. The average combined silt, very fine sand and clay is assumed to be less than 50 percent. No distinct stratification is present. Rock fragments in the control section range from 0 to 3 percent, by volume, and are usually less than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon is dark brown, brown, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown in 10YR hue. It is assumed to have 1.5 to 3 percent organic matter in the upper 10 inches and organic matter decreases gradually to less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches. This horizon has weak granular or weak subangular blocky structure or is massive. It is neutral to medium acid.\nThe C horizon is brown, light yellowish brown, brownish yellow, or grayish brown. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline and is non-calcareous."

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium derived from sedimentary or granitic sources. The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with cool moist winters and somewhat dry foggy summers. The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. The average frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

Alo and Bosanko soils are fine textured, have deep cracks when dry, and a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cieneba soils have ochric epipedons and a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches. Corralitos soils are sandy and have ochric epipedons. Fontana soils have fine-loamy particle size families and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Lockwood soils have an argillic horizon."
