These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice overlying glacial till or local colluvium. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 75 inches. The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 55 to 110 days and the growing season (28 degrees F.) is 95 to 150 days."
