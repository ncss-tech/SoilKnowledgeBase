  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cortada series consist of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on flood plains.  They formed in stratified loamy sediments that weathered from volcanic and limestone rocks. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
