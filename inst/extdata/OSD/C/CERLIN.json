  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 45 to 76 inches.  Carbonates are absent in the solum.  Reaction is medium acid or strongly acid in the most acid part of the loamy sediments and ranges from medium acid to neutral in the clayey paleosol.  The surficial loamy sediments typically are 24 to 36 inches thick but range from 20 inches to 40 inches.  In some pedons, a sandy loam or loamy sand horizon less than 5 inches thick is between the surficial sediments and the clayey material.\nThe Ap or A horizon typically is very dark brown (10YR 2/2), but ranges from black (10YR 2/1) to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)  with very dark brown (10YR 2/2 or black 10YR 2/1) coatings on faces of peds.  An AB horizon is in some pedons.  The A horizon typically is silt loam or loam with about 20 to 40 percent sand.\nThe BA horizon and the Bw horizon are clay loam or silty clay loam with about 15 to 40 percent sand.  The BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 and have few to many mottles with chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe 2Bt horizon dominantly has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The upper part typically has chroma ranging from 2 to 4.  Mottles range from few to many and from red (2.5YR 4/8) to olive brown (2.5Y 4/4).  A few pedons lack mottles.  The 2Bt horizon typically is clay or silty clay with about 42 to 55 percent clay.  White (10YR 8/1) dry, uncoated sand grains and silt coatings typically are on the faces of peds in the 2Bt1 horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silty clay, clay, clay loam, or loam.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 45 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Papineau series in the same family and the Donnan, Jacwin, and Kenyon series.  Papineau soils are shallower to carbonates and have a higher content of sand in the surficial materials.  Donnan soils lack mollic epipedons.  Jacwin soils have shale substrata.  Kenyon soils contain less clay in the 2B and 2C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cerlin soils are on long, smooth convex slopes in a landscape with a dendritic drainage system.  They are generally on convex ridges, but are also on convex sideslopes and slightly concave headslopes.  Slope gradients typically are 1 to 5 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  They formed in about 20 to 40 inches of surficial loamy sediments and highly weathered glacial till (paleosol).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 34 inches."

Donnan soils are on similar landscape positions as Cerlin soils.  Dinsdale, Kenyon, Klinger, and Readlyn soils developed in loamy or silty surficial sediments and loam or clay loam glacial till.  They are on convex slopes above and below Cerlin soils.  Floyd soils occupy lower concave slopes and developed in loamy surficial sediments and stratified glacial till."
