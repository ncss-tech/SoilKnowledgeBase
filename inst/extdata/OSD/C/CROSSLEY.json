  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crossley series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from  limestone, sandstone, and dolomite.  Crossley soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, shoulders, and ridges. Slopes are 4 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
