The nature and color of the parent material of this series do not usually show the normal reduced matrix colors typically associated with saturation and reducing conditions.\nIsotic mineralogy--based on 1500 kPa water to measured clay ratio of 0.6 or greater\nThe designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material. Evidence of clay and silt translocation can be seen on faces between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
