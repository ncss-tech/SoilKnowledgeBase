Thickness of the silty loess mantle is 1 to 2 inches.  Texture of the control section is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with greater than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content throughout the profile ranges from 0 to 30 percent subangular pebbles and cobbles.  Reaction in the solum is moderately or slightly acid and slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Color striations are common in this horizon.  Texture is silt loam or silt.  The rock fragment content is less than 5 percent\ngravel and cobble.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam or clay loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy loam or silty clay loam.
