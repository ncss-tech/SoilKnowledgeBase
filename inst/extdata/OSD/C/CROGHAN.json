  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mineral solum thickness ranges from 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 in). Textures are predominantly sandy but include fine sandy loam within a depth of 25 cm (10 in) from the mineral soil surface which can include all or part of the A horizon, the E horizon, if present, and the upper part of the B horizon. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface and subsurface, and from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil and substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR or is neutral, with value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 0 to 3. It is slightly to highly decomposed plant material. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Ap horizons include value of 5 and chroma of 3, and are up to 33 cm (13 in) thick. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have an A/E horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or less. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a Bh horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 to 4. Combined thickness of the Bhs and Bh horizon is up to 15 cm (6 in) thick. Texture and reaction ranges are the same as the Bhs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2.5 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. Thin strata of very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam are present in some pedons below a depth of 101 cm (40 in). Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Croghan soils are on terraces and sand plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. They formed in deltaic or glacial outwash sand that was deposited in or next to proglacial lake basins. The sediments are dominated by quartz, but feldspars and other weatherable minerals constitute at least 10 percent, and generally 20 percent or more of the volume. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1270 mm (30 to 50 in). The frost-free period ranges from 90 to about 160 days. Elevation ranges from 46 to 914 m  (150 to 3000 ft) above sea level."

The somewhat excessively drained Adams soils and the poorly and somewhat poorly drained Naumburg soils are in a drainage sequence with Croghan soils. Wallace soils are associated where ortstein layers are prominent. Becket, Hermon, and Worth soils formed in till and are on nearby uplands."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Dominantly forested or idle, but some areas are cropped. Cropped areas are mainly used for hay or for blueberry production, but in some locations oats, or corn for silage is grown. Eastern white pine, hemlock, balsam, red pine, sugar maple, and yellow birch are in woodlots. Brushy aspen and birch are on idle land."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location was moved from Clinton County, NY to Essex County, NY in 2000 to better reflect the classification and drainage class.\nThe use of the frigid Croghan Series in MLRAs 101, 144A, and 145 will likely end as MLRA updates are completed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 cm (3 in) (Oi and A horizons).\n2. Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 in) (E horizon)\n3. Spodic horizon - the zone from 13 to 36 cm (5 to 14 in) (Bhs and Bs1 horizons).\n4. Aquic conditions - as evidenced by redoximorphic features within 76 cm (30 in) of the mineral surface (BC and C1 horizons).\ne. Non-spodic pedogenic horizon - the zone from 36 to 58 cm, (14 to 23 in) (Bs2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
