    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Flakes of mica range from few to many in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Pebbles range from none to 5 percent by volume.\nThe Btg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or they are neutral with value of 4 through 6.  It is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam in some pedons.  The clay content of the upper Btg horizon ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Few to common brown, red, or gray mottles are throughout the horizon; however, they are absent in some upper Btg horizons.  Pebbles range from none to 15 percent by volume.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is coarse sand, loamy sand, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  In some pedons, the fine earth fraction and gravel are stratified.  Pebbles range from 0 to 50 percent."

Baile soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the Bt horizon and annual precipitation of about 40 inches.  Shrewsbury soils have sandy clay loam Bt horizons and contain glauconite in the control section.  Augusta, Prout, Summerfield, and Yemassee soils have chroma of more than 2 in the upper B horizon.  In addition, Augusta, Summerfield, and Yemassee soils have soil temperatures above 59 degrees F.  Elkton and Purdy soils have a clayey control section.  Othello soils have a fine-silty control section.  Tomotley and Weston soils have soil temperature above 59 degrees F."

Elevation is 1400 to 2500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 55 to 75 inches and evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.  These soils flood occasionally for very brief periods."
