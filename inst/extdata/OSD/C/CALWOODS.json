  "REVDATE": "02/2000",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Calwoods series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in loess or loess and pedisediment or glacial till.  These soils are on broad summits and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

If an A horizon has value of 3, thickness is less than 6 inches.  The E horizon has color value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but may be silty clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  The upper part of the Btg horizon contains many prominent reddish mottles and the lower part contains strong brown or yellowish brown mottles.  Some pedons have 2Btg horizons with clay loam or silty clay loam texture.  The particle size control section averages between 45 and 60 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."
