    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2Btg or 2Cg horizon is 27 to 54 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has dominant color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  If an A horizon has value of 3, thickness is less than 6 inches.  The E horizon has color value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but may be silty clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  The upper part of the Btg horizon contains many prominent reddish mottles and the lower part contains strong brown or yellowish brown mottles.  Some pedons have 2Btg horizons with clay loam or silty clay loam texture.  The particle size control section averages between 45 and 60 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

Bluford soils are brittle in the series control section where having a 2Btx horizon.  Hurst soils do not have the red mottles in the upper part of the solum.  Keomah, Kernan, and Sabina soils average less than 45 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Rathbun soils do not have red mottles or 2Btg or 2Cg horizons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calwoods soils are on nearly level and gently sloping broad summits.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  They formed in loess or loess and pedisediment or glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."

Hatton and Lindley soils have higher chroma matrix in the B horizons and, in addition, Lindley soils formed in till.  Marion soils have an abrupt textural change between the E and B horizons.  Mexico soils have moist value and chroma of 3 or less in the surface horizon.  Hatton, Marion and Mexico soils are in similar positions and Lindley soils are downslope."
