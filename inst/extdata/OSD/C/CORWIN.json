  "OVERVIEW": "The Corwin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Corwin soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying till. They are on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
