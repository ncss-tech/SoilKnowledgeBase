See pedon IDs S2014AK290001 and S2014AK290002 in the NCSS database for supporting calcium carbonate data.\nSodic properties may be present in some horizons with an exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 15 percent, but these horizons do not meet diagnostic criteria for a natric horizon. See pedon IDs S2014AK290001 and S2014AK290002 in the NCSS database for supporting chemical data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
