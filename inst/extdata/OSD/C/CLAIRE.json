  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is typically coarse sand, sand or loamy coarse sand.  The soil ranges from slightly acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Where the lower part of the surface layer has value of 5 or less dry and 3 or less moist it contains less than 1 percent organic matter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loamy coarse sand or loamy sand, but some is coarse sand, sand, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Some pedons have Ab horizons.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It commonly does not have carbonates, but some peds have slight effervescence at depths of 30 to 50 inches.  Some pedons have coarser or finer textured materials at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

Abbeylake and Corliss soils are not dry in the soil moisture control section for 35 to 45 consecutive days for 120 days following the summer solstice.  In addition, Corliss soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Cantlin, Champlain and Serden soils are dominated by fine sand in the series control section.  Friendship soils have distinct redoximorphic features within depths of 36 inches.  Grayling, Menahga, Nymore, Sartell and Sunday soils are medium to very strongly acid.  Mahtomedi soils have a Bw horizon.  Plainbo soils have bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Shawano soils have B horizons with hue of 7.5YR and chroma of 4 or higher."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Claire soils are on level to hilly glacial outwash or delta plains.  Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 4 percent but are as steep as 25 percent.  The soils formed in coarse sand.  The climate is subhumid, with short warm summers and long cold winters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 22 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Serden soils and the Hamar, Hecla, Lohnes and Maddock soils.  Serden soils are on nearby plains.  Hamar soils are in concave swales and basins and are poorly drained.  Hecla and Maddock soils are on nearby plains and contain less coarse sand and more fine and very fine sand.  Hecla, Lohnes and Maddock soils have a mollic epipedon. Lohnes soils are in less sloping and concave areas in the same plain as the Claire soils."
