  "OVERVIEW": "The Charpeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite. Charpeak soils are on upper back slopes of mountains and slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
