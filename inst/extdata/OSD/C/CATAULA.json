  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the dense, partially brittle layer ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet. The solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches thick. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to about 7 percent by volume. These consist of angular fragments of quartz often occurring as quartz stringers. The A horizon is very strongly acid to slightly acid, and all of the other horizons are very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Where eroded, the Ap horizon ranges to hue of 5YR and is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe BE or BA horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. The lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, or mottles of red or yellowish red. The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay and is nonbrittle.\nThe Btx or upper part of the BC horizon is horizontally layered. The red layers have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. They are brittle, dense, and thought to be weakly cemented with iron oxides and are sandy clay loam or clay loam. Brittle material occupies about 20 to 60 percent of the horizon. The brown layers have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons contain mottles or streaks of gray. The mottles are nonbrittle but are firm or very firm and are sandy clay loam or clay loam. In some pedons, texture ranges to clay or sandy clay. The lower part of the BC horizon, in most pedons, is mottled with reddish, brownish, grayish, and yellowish colors. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon (where present) has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, commonly is variegated in shades of yellow, red, and brown. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and consists of highly weathered saprolite that crushes easily."
