  "OVERVIEW": "The Crowers series consists of very deep, well drained  soils on canyon sides.  They formed in loess and basalt colluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 45 to 80 percent.  The average annual temperature is about  50 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about  14 inches.",
