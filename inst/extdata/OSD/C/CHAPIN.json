  "OVERVIEW": "The Chapin series consists of well drained soils formed in moderately thin, calcareous, reddish brown or brown materials originating partly as eolian materials, alluvium from reddish brown sedimentary rocks or residiuum from such formations.  Chapin soils are on gently to moderately sloping mesa tops, hills, ridges, and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Typically, Chapin soils have brown very friable granular noncalcareous A horizons, reddish brown noncalcareous heavy clay loam B2t horizons having prismatic and blocky structure and pinkish gray calcareous light clay loam C horizons that have continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation over hard sandstone bedrock at a depth of 36 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 6 to 30 inches and is not shallower than the upper 3 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 36 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  ESP ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum, but exceeds 15 percent in the Cca horizon of some pedons.  A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 5YR or redder, although subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock.  They are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy sand from 15 to 55 percent with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10R.  It is typically loam or clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 50 percent, and sand from 20 to 70 percent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate of the fine earth ranges from 15 to 50 percent."

Boneek, Torreon, and Wormser soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the B2t horizon.  Also, Wormser soils lack a calcic horizon.  Collbran, Gober, Loma, Nunn, Rednun, Richfield, Ryus, and Sofia soils lack a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Dagflat soils are fine-loamy and are noncalcareous throughout.  Emigrant soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches and are shallower than 17 inches to the base of the argillic horizon."
