    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F, and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually dry from July 1 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from December 1 to April 30.  The soils usually increase in alkalinity with increasing depth but are noncalcareous.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay.  Organic carbon is 1 to 5 percent to a depth of 20 to 35 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 2.5Y 3/2.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly hard to very hard and is neutral to moderately acid.  Some pedons have AB or BA horizons.\nThe upper Bt horizon dry color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5/2 N 3/0, or N 4/0.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3 4/4; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2.  In some pedons the lower part has dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 6/6. Moist colors are 4/4, 5/3 or 5/4 and some also have mottles.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay in the upper 20 inches.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower Bt horizon dry color has hues of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y and values 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 6 moist.  Chroma is 1 through 3 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or clay and is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are underlain by gravel."
