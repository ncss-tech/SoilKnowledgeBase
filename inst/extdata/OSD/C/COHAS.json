  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the contrasting material ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy sediments, and from 0 to 75 percent in individual horizons in the contrasting material with a weighted average of 35 percent or more within 40 inches from the surface.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y and chroma of 1 or 2. The value is 3 or 4 moist. Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Structure is fine, medium, or coarse granular.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak fine granular, or the horizon is massive.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak fine granular, or the horizon is massive.\nThe 2C horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 8.  Texture ranges from fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abenaki, Colton, Metallak, and Rumney series.  The well drained Abenaki and the moderately well drained Metallak soils are in a drainage sequence with Cohas soils, and are in higher positions on alluvial terraces.  Colton soils have spodic horizons and are on adjacent glacial outwash terraces.  Rumney soils are in similar positions on the landscape, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, and have organic matter content decreasing irregularly with depth."

The previous classification was coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Aeric Endoaquents\n2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typifying pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 18 inches (Bw and Bg horizon).\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle size class - the zone from 10 to 18 inches is coarse-loamy and has less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser, and the zone from 18 to 40 inches is sandy-skeletal.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data is available for this pedon:  S83NH-7-16.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
