  "OVERVIEW": "The Cohas series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy sediments underlain by sandy and gravelly deposits on alluvial terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments and rapid or very rapid in the sandy and gravelly deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Colton soils have spodic horizons and are on adjacent glacial outwash terraces.  Rumney soils are in similar positions on the landscape, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, and have organic matter content decreasing irregularly with depth."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typifying pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 18 inches (Bw and Bg horizon).\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle size class - the zone from 10 to 18 inches is coarse-loamy and has less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser, and the zone from 18 to 40 inches is sandy-skeletal."
