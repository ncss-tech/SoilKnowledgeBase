  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  The shell fragments are calcareous.  Silt plus clay in the control section is less than 5 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of value of 2 to 4.  Content of shell fragments ranges from about 5 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6.  Streaks and splotches in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to common.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray range from few to many.  This horizon is a mixture of sand and multicolored shells or shell fragments, but in some pedons sand and shells are stratified.  Content of shell ranges from 10 to 60 percent in some subhorizon within the control section.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Adamsville, Broward, Padre, Panam, and Satellite series in the same family.  All these soils lack shells within depths of 80 inches.  Adamsville, Broward, and Satellite soils are somewhat poorly drained.  In addition, Adamsville soils are on slightly lower positions, Broward soils are on similar positions and are moderately deep to limestone, while Satellite soils are on similar positions.  Padre and Panam soils are confined to the dune areas of the Texas Gulf coast."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canaveral soils are on low dune-like ridges and side slopes bordering depressions and sloughs along the coast in the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range up to 5 percent.  They formed in thick marine deposits of sand and shell fragments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

All the associated soils except Palm Beach and Welaka soils lack shells within depths of 80 inches.  Anclote, Delray, and Pompano soils are on lower positions and are very poorly drained.  In addition, Anclote and Delray soils have mollic epipedons.  Palm Beach, Paola, St. Lucie, and Welaka soils are on higher positions.  In addition, Palm Beach soils are well to somewhat excessively drained, Paola soils are excessively drained and have poorly defined spodic horizons, St. Lucie soils are excessively drained, and Welaka soils are well drained, have poorly defined spodic horizons, and also have cambic horizons."

The native vegetation consists of cabbage palm, scattered sawpalmetto, magnolias, bays, and slash pine with an understory of gallberry and pineland threeawn."
