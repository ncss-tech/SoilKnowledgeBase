  "OVERVIEW": "The Collegiate series consists of deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or glacial outwash.  These soils are on flood plains, low terraces, and old glacial outwash channels.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Collegiate soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 40 inches thick.  It typically extends to the IIC horizon, but mottled B2 horizons of low chroma occur in some pedons.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the control section is typically light loam or very fine sandy loam and average 5 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 60 percent silt, and 22 to 75 percent sand, with less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the upper control section and are typically less than 3 inches in diameter, but range up to 10 inches in diameter.  The A and C horizons above a depth of 40 inches are neutral or slightly alkaline."

The soil formed in alluvial or glacial outwash parent materials derived from various sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
