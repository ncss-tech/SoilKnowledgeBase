  "OVERVIEW": "The Collegiate series consists of deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or glacial outwash.  These soils are on flood plains, low terraces, and old glacial outwash channels.  The mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
