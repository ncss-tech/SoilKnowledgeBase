  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Free carbonates generally are in all parts of these soils, but in some pedons the upper 10 inches or less do not have free carbonates. The control section has between 3 and 10 percent calcium carbonate. These soils do not have rock fragments in the upper 40 inches and to considerably greater depths. The control section has 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has colors in a stratified pattern. It mostly has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, but hue of 5Y is in the lower part in some pedons. It has value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. It has chroma of 3 only in the lower part or with hue of 5Y. It is stratified; dominant textures are silt loam, loam, and very fine sandy loam; but the range includes fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Snail shell fragments are absent in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chaska soils have plane or concave slopes on flood plains that commonly have intermingled backwater sloughs and oxbows. Their slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy, recent alluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches. Frost-free days range from 110 to 160. Elevation above sea level ranges from 500 to 1000 feet."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is slow. Early spring flooding is common. The water table is at or near the surface for significant periods during the year unless artificially drained. The water table typically rises and falls with the rise and fall of the water level in the nearby river."
