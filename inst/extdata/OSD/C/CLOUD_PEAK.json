  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Content of organic carbon ranges from 1 to 5 percent in a thin A horizon but decreases rapidly and uniformly with increasing depth.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 32 to 47 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard and slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The matrix material is typically silt loam or silty clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 35 to 60 percent, and sand from 10 to 45 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 20 percent cobbles or stones or both.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It has 2 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth portion.  Texture of the matrix is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam modified with 10 to 35 percent pebbles and 45 to 55 percent cobbles or stones or rocks.  Reaction is slightly through strongly alkaline."

Cadotte, Cundiyo, Losee and Macfarlane soils are very deep.  Kimpton soils have more than 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Lulude soils have a E/B horizon and no secondary carbonate accumulation.  Guffey and Lake Creek soils do not have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Lakehelen soils have reaction of slightly acid or moderately acid throughout. Tepecreek soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and deep to a lithic contact."

The soils formed in material weathered from limestone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 53 degrees F."
