Chinkle soils have 8 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 35 percent hard rock fragments and are 20 to 30 inches to hard bedrock. Cochora soils have 8 to 18 percent clay, paralithic contact at 14 to 20 inches and is dry from April to December. Cougarbutte soils have 8 to 18 percent clay and granitic parent material. Randsburg soils are deeper than 40 inches to hard bedrock and have less than 20 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Calwash soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, and limestone over residuum from sandstone, mudstone or siltstone. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,000 feet. The climate is characteristic of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
