They formed in eolian material over residuum derived from gypsum bedrock of the Jurassic age Todilto Formation.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 5,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
