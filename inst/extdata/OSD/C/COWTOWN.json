  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowtown series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived principally from shale.  Cowtown soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
