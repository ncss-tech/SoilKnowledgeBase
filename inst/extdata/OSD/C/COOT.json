  "OVERVIEW": "The Coot series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to shale on strath terraces.  These soils formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying calcareous gravel and sand.  Permeability is moderate in the outwash and rapid in the gravel and sand.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  Depth to a paralithic contact in shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments and coarse fragments in the outwash are primarily igneous.  The particle size control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and/or A horizons) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is commonly loam but includes clay loam.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt, Btg, 2Bt, and/or 2Btg horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.   Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The upper part (Bt or Btg) typically is clay loam but includes sandy clay loam.  The lower part (2Bt or 2Btg) is gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Redox concentrations are present throughout, commonly as masses of iron accumulation lining ped surfaces and pores.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt or Btg and 15 to 35 percent in the 2Bt or 2Btg horizon.\nThe lower part of the series control section to a depth of 41 inches (2C horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8.  It commonly is gravelly loamy coarse sand but includes strata of gravel and sand.  Content of rock fragments and coarse fragments ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  The 2C horizon varies considerably in the proportion of sand and gravel.  Some pedons contain stones.  The lower 10 inches of the control section to a depth of 51 inches (3Cr horizon) is clayey shale.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."
