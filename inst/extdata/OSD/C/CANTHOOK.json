  "OVERVIEW": "The Canthook series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy and sandy glaciofluvial or eolian deposits and the underlying silty to clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters.",
