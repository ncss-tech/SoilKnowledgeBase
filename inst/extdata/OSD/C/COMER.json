  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have ochric epipedons.  Typically they are noncalcareous for 60 inches, but must be noncalcareous for more than 40 inches.  There should be no bedrock or strongly contrasting substratums above 40 inches.  Organic carbon content normally ranges from .4 to 1.5 percent in the A horizon and decreases uniformly with depth.  Conductivity is usually less than 2 millimho but should not exceed 16 millimhos.  Exchangeable sodium percentage is usually less than 1 percent but should not exceed 15 percent.  The soil is bast saturated.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is generally less than 5 percent.  Texture of the control section is typically a fine sandy loam but clay may range from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 50 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Any loamy sand coarser than loamy very fine sand is exempt from the above range.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees F. to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees F. to 70 degrees F.  In 7 out of 10 years these soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 1/4 but less than 1/2 the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F., and they are moist in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 60 cumulative days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nColor of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 6 dry or 3 to 5 moist, and in chroma from 2 to 3.  When the value of the A horizon is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist the horizon must be too thin, or contain too little organic matter to be a mollic epipedon.  Reaction normally ranges from pH 6.6 to pH 7.8 (1:5 dilution organic dye).  Primary structure is usually granular but may be subangular blocky.  Consistence ranges from soft to slightly hard.\nHue of the C horizon ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from pH 6.6 to pH 7.8 (1:5 dilution organic dye).  Texture is usually a fine sandy loam."

The soils is developing in thick, noncalcareous, moderately coarse textured materials derived from sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F.., mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 61 degrees F."
