  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material is 0 to 10 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from about 59 to 63 degrees F.  The control section is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam, averaging 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Flat fragments or fine pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent.  Thin, discontinuous horizons of carbonate accumulation occur immediately above the paralithic contact in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The Riedel soils are similar but have fractured soft bedrock from 7 to 20 inches in which roots grow, but the soil is considered moderately deep."

The soils formed in calcareous material weathered from semiconsolidated fine grained sandstone or siltstone.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  Elevation is 5,300 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 120 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and local air drainage."
