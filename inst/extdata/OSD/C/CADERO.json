  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cadero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from weakly consolidated ash.  These soils are on shoulders, summits, and upper backslopes of hills with north-facing aspects.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
