  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard shale, siltstone, or sandstone bedrock ranges from 40 to 90 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in each horizon, except the surface is less acid where limed.  Coarse fragments, mainly channers of shale, siltstone, or sandstone range from 0 to 10 percent from the surface to the bottom of the Btx horizon and from 10 to 70 percent in the BC horizon or C horizon where present.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many in shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam, silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  A lithologic discontinuity is evident in most pedons, but is not a requirement of the series."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series recognized in this family at present. In closely related families are the Tilsit and Butlertown series.  The Tilsit series differs only by having mixed mineralogy.  The Butlertown series formed in Coastal Plain sediments and has mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clarkrange soils are on broad plateaus, isolated hilltops, and undulating ridgetops.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from shale, siltstone, sandstone, or interbedded sandstone and shale.  In places, the upper part of the solum formed in a silty mantle of colluvium or loess.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual air temperature is 55.1 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 54.2 inches."

Gilpin, Muskingum, Ramsey, and Shelocta soils are on adjacent sideslopes.  Lonewood soils are on adjacent ridgetops and slightly lower sideslopes."
