  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarkrange series consists of very deep and deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from shale and sandstone on uplands. These soils have a dense fragipan in the subsoil.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 8 percent, but range extends from 0 to 15 percent.",
