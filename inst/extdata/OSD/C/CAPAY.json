  "OVERVIEW": "The Capay series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in  fine textured alluvium derived from mostly sandstone and shale.  Capay soils are on flood basins, alluvial fans, interfan basins and basin rims.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches(541 mm)and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",

Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline becoming more alkaline with increasing depth.  Some pedons have a few mottles in the A horizon. These are commonly associated with rice culture.  The lower part of the A horizon may have intersecting slickensides.\nThe Bssk and B'k horizons are 10YR 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 4/4; 5Y 6/4, 6/3, 5/3, 5/2 or 4/3.

    "content": "REMARKS: Redoximorphic features in the A horizon are associated with rice culture.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 21 inches (Ap, Bssk1).\nCracking - it is assumed from the cracking statement in the RIC that the soil does not meet Aridic subgroup criteria.\nSeries reclassified May 1996.\nRunoff terminology adjusted 5/96 to the adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nThe previous horizonation Ap, Ak, Bssk1, Bssk2, Bssk3, Bk is updated. The suffix k indicated an accumulation of carbonates making the Ak a B horizon. The RIC stated that \"The lower part of the A horizon has intersecting slickensides\" but the Type Location does not have them. Thus Ak is changed to Bk and the last horizon is changed to B'k. (KP) 6/2003\nEdits made after SDJR projects and additional horizons and lab textures and pH were incorporated from lab pedon ID S1964CA095002. The additional horizons show a lithologic discontinuity at 157 cm that is likely due to sea level rise between 20 to 6 thousand years ago and the associated stream gradient change.-AEC\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedons:  S64CA-095-002 (40A-385); S64CA-113-013 (40A-3086); S91CA-099-003 (91P-344); S67CA-065-001; S64CA-113-013; S91CA-099-003 and -004 (partial pedons); S92CA-099-005 (county type location).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
