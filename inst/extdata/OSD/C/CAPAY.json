  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F. Some pedons are saline-sodic throughout. The soils have 1 to 2 cm wide cracks that open and close at least once each year and remain open for 150 days or less in the summer.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 3/2, 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2 or 3/2, moist values are commonly one unit lower.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline becoming more alkaline with increasing depth.  Some pedons have a few mottles in the A horizon. These are commonly associated with rice culture.  The lower part of the A horizon may have intersecting slickensides.\nThe Bssk and B'k horizons are 10YR 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 4/4; 5Y 6/4, 6/3, 5/3, 5/2 or 4/3.  Moist values are the same or 1 to 2 units darker.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have loam textures in the lower part of the profile.  Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline. Lime is in concretions, soft masses and disseminated throughout the horizon."

Bosquejo soils have redoximorphic features and no secondary carbonates below the lithologic discontinuity. Maxwell soils are 24 to 56 inches deep to carbonates and have a chroma of 1.5 in the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Capay soils are on flood basins, alluvial fans,  interfan basins at elevations below 1,200 feet.  They formed in  fine textured alluvium derived from sandstone and shale or other mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils are in a dry climate of relatively hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 28 inches.  Mean January temperature is 47 degrees F, mean July temperature is 72 degrees F, mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 185 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Redoximorphic features in the A horizon are associated with rice culture.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 21 inches (Ap, Bssk1).\nCracking - it is assumed from the cracking statement in the RIC that the soil does not meet Aridic subgroup criteria.\nSeries reclassified May 1996.\nRunoff terminology adjusted 5/96 to the adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nThe previous horizonation Ap, Ak, Bssk1, Bssk2, Bssk3, Bk is updated. The suffix k indicated an accumulation of carbonates making the Ak a B horizon. The RIC stated that \"The lower part of the A horizon has intersecting slickensides\" but the Type Location does not have them. Thus Ak is changed to Bk and the last horizon is changed to B'k. (KP) 6/2003\nEdits made after SDJR projects and additional horizons and lab textures and pH were incorporated from lab pedon ID S1964CA095002. The additional horizons show a lithologic discontinuity at 157 cm that is likely due to sea level rise between 20 to 6 thousand years ago and the associated stream gradient change.-AEC\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedons:  S64CA-095-002 (40A-385); S64CA-113-013 (40A-3086); S91CA-099-003 (91P-344); S67CA-065-001; S64CA-113-013; S91CA-099-003 and -004 (partial pedons); S92CA-099-005 (county type location).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
