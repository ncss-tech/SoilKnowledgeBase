  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarno series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcium carbonates typically is 16 to 18 inches but ranges from 12 to 26 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches and extends into the upper part of the Bw horizon in most pedons.  The control section typically averages between 20 and 30 percent clay, but ranges to 34 percent in some pedons.   Bulk density of the C horizon is between 1.50 to 1.80.  Some pedons contain up to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically it is loam, but some pedons are silt loam or fine sandy loam when mantled by a thin layer of sandy aeolian material.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Masses of calcium carbonate are common or many.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline. Crystals of gypsum are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have masses of gypsum."

Hand soils are on similar landscapes as the Clarno soils.  Betts soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on ridgetops.  Bonilla and Prosper soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are in shallow ill-defined drainageways and flats.  Crossplain soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and are wetter and in swales.  Davison soils have a calcic horizon and are on slight rises and adjacent to swales and depressions.  Dudley and Stickney soils have a natric horizon and are on nearly level landscape positions with microrelief.  Ethan soils have carbonates within 10 inches of the surface and are on upper slopes.  Houdek soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes to the Clarno soils.  Tetonka soils are fine textured and wetter and are in depressions."
