  "OVERVIEW": "The Casito series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in very gravelly sediments derived primarily from rhyolite, andesite and less amounts of sedimentary rocks.  Casito soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
