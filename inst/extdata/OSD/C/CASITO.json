  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Casito soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slope is usually about 2 percent, ranging from about 1 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in very gravelly sediments derived primarily from such igneous rocks as rhyolite andesite, in places with lesser amounts of sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 10 inches with a marked summer maximum.  Mean annual air temperature is 60 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."

Vado soils have cambic horizons and do not have petrocalcic horizons.  Terino soils are not effervescent in all parts of the argillic horizon.  Nolam soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.
