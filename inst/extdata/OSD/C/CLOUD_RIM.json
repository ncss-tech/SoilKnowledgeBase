  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The solum is 50 inches or more thick.  The rock fragments are mainly gravel and cobbles of sandstone, but some are gneiss and schist.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 80 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to slightly acid and is 10 to 16 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or sandy clay loam and contains few to 20 percent gravel and cobbles. Stones occur in some pedons.  This horizon generally has moderate or weak coarse or medium subangular blocky or prismatic structure parting to fine and medium subangular blocky.  It is neutral to slightly acid. Rock fragments increase up to 35 percent below a 40 inch depth in some pedons.  The texture is clay below 60 inches in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a C horizon at depth of 50 to 60 inches that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from gravelly or cobbly silt loam to very gravelly sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cloud Rim soils are on moderately steep to steep mountainsides at elevations of 5,600 to 7,500 feet.  Slope ranged from 15 to 40 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from mixed sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, mainly sandstone and quartzite that include some gneiss and schist.  The climate is moist subhumid with 18 to 25 inches of precipitation, falling mostly as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Wallsburg soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock and have fine textured argillic horizons that contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments."
