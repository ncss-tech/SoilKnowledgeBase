  "OVERVIEW": "The Connel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Connel soils are on beach terraces barrier bars, lagoons, stream terraces, intermittent drainage channels, fan piedmont remnants, fan skirts and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
