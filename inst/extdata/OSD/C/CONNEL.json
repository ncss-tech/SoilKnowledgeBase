These soils formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
