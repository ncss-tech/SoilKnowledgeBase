  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiefpan series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite. Chiefpan soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
