  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  Profile is calcareous throughout with secondary lime present in the lower horizons.  Sandy and gravelly lenses may occur in any horizon or mixed throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from gravelly clay loam to clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from gravelly clay loam to clay loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is dominantly heavy clay loam in texture.  Structure ranges from weak medium to weak coarse subangular blocky with few to common pressure faces.  Consistence ranges from firm to friable.\nThe 3C and 4C horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 5.  They are typically stratified with clay or gravelly clay with numerous slickensides or pressure faces and the lower horizons grading into sand and gravel at depths of 48 to 68 inches."

The regolith consists of a younger mantle of moderately fine over older fine textured plastic marine sediments.  The climate is semiarid.  Rainfall ranges from 30 to 35 inches and mean annual temperature from 78 to 80 degrees F."

The San Anton soils have formed in recent moderately fine textured gravelly sediments along the inland stream channels.  The Jaucas occur between the sea and the Cornhill soils and have coarse textured, calcareous light colored profiles."
