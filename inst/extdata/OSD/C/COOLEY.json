  "OVERVIEW": "The Cooley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium from sandstone.  The Cooley soils are on mountainsides and hillsides.  Slope is 40 to 80 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
