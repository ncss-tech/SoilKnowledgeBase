  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sola range from 30 to 60 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches.  These soils are usually dry 105 to 120 days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F.  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 15 to 25 percent particles coarser than very fine sand including 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  The lower part of the argillic horizon contains 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak to moderate structure.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is heavy silt loam in the upper part and silt loam, heavy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the lower part.  This horizon has moderate to strong blocky structure.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, where present, has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry or is multicolored.  It is loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand and has 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.   Some pedons have a 2C horizon with similar color and texture that lack secondary line.\nThe 2Cr layers, where present, are sandstone or schist."

Bissell soils are micaceous throughout.  Bjork, Dodes, Indiano, Pahrange, Simcoe, and Uhalde soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Margerum soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly pumice, in the particle-size control section. Ralls soils have 15 to 35 percent basalt fragments in the particle-size control section.  Springmeyer and Wenatchee soils have 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in loess over residuum from sandstone, or schist. The climate is semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 9 to 12 inches.  These soils have hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters; average annual temperature is 49 degrees F., average January temperature is 29 degrees F., average July temperature is 70 degrees F., and average frost-free season is 135 to 185 days."
