The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  The particle size control section averages between 35 and 42 percent clay and less than 10 percent sand.\nThe upper part of the control section (Ap or A horizon) has value of 2 or 3 moist (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe next part of the control section (E, Eg, or EBg horizon to a depth of at least 24 inches) has value of 4 to 7 moist (6 to 8 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles have value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon which is less than 3 inches in thickness.\nThe next part of the control section (Btg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.
