  "OVERVIEW": "The Copperworld series consists of very shallow or shallow to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphic rocks. Copperworld soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C. The frost-free season is 210 to 270 days/",

Aftaden soils have a climate typical of the Chihuahuan desert and are formed from basalt. Paradise Spring and Zyplar soils have 20 to 30 percent clay throughout the particle size control section and Paradise Spring soils are shallow to bedrock. Sparkhule soils are shallow and contain more than 25 percent clay in the particle size control section. Stonegold soils are formed from basalt."
