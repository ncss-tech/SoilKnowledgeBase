Aftaden soils have a climate typical of the Chihuahuan desert and are formed from basalt. Paradise Spring and Zyplar soils have 20 to 30 percent clay throughout the particle size control section and Paradise Spring soils are shallow to bedrock. Sparkhule soils are shallow and contain more than 25 percent clay in the particle size control section. Stonegold soils are formed from basalt."
