  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cutcomb series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in organic material on fens on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes typically are less than 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches).",
