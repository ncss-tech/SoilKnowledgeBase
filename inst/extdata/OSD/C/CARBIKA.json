  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Carbika series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. They are formed in loamy eolian sediments over alluvium. These soils occur in interdunal depressions on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.",
