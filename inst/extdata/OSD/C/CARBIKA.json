The fine-loamy Carway soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are moderately deep to buried soil material with greater than 35 percent clay. They are on similar positions. The moderately well drained, sandy Dillhut soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on low dunes. Funmar and Taver soils are moderately well drained and are on higher positions surrounding the depressions. The well drained, coarse-loamy Hayes soils are on dunes. The well drained, sandy Pratt and Turon soils are on dunes. The well drained, fine-loamy Saltcreek soils are on dunes. Solvay soils are better drained and do not contain a buried soil with 30 to 45 percent clay, and are on slightly higher positions."
