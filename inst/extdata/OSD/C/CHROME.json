Briggsville, Eldean, Lamoille, Newnata, Paintcreek, Upshur, Woodsfield and Wynn soils have bedrock at a depth greater than 40 inches. Briggsville soils have carbonates ranging in depths from 20 to 40 inches and have no rock fragments in the control section.  Edenton soils have a paralithic contact with calcareous shale and limestone within depths of 20 to 40 and have fragments of glacial gravel. Eldean soils have carbonates within depths of 18 to 36 inches and have dominant rock fragments composed of glacial chert, limestone and shale gravel. Lamoille soils have a rock fragment of more than 35 percent in the lower half of the series control section and have matrix hues of 10YR or 2.5Y in the lower third of the series control section.  Newnata soils have a lithic contact with limestone bedrock within depths of 40 to 60 inches. Paintcreek soils have a lithic contact of dolomite bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches. Redbrush soils have dominant rock fragments in the particle control section of quartz and mafic gneiss gravel and cobbles and have a lithic contact with mafic gneiss bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Upshur soils have hues 5YR or redder in the subsoil and have a sand content of less than 10 percent sand in the particle-size control section. The Woodsfield soils have rock fragments consisting of shale, siltstone and sandstone. Wynn soils have rock fragments composed of glacial limestone gravel and cobbles and have a paralithic contact with calcareous shale and limestone within depths of 20 to 40 inches."

They formed in residuum weathered from serpentine, or from other basic rocks high in magnesium.  Climate is humid and temperate with mean annual precipitation of 38 to 46 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 170 to 200 days."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Typical vegetation is described as pine-savannah. Unfavorable physical and chemical properties of serpentine soils, such as shallowness, stoniness, low available water capacity and high levels of iron and magnesium and low levels of silica and calcium make these soils unfavorable for plant growth, especially in mixed hardwoods, resulting in a unique prairie-pine ecosystem termed barrens\". In some instances these soils may contain plant toxic levels of nickel, chromium and cobalt (Mansburg, 1984). Approximately 90 percent of the Chrome soils are in woodland or in pasture.  About 10 percent of the soils are cultivated."
