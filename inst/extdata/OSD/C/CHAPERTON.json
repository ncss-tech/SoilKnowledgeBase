  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chaperton series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale. These soils are on gently sloping to steep rolling hills and cuesta dipslopes. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
