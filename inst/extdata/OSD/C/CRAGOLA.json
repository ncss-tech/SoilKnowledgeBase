  "REVDATE": "07/97",
  "STATES": "UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cragola series consists of shallow, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium over soft interbedded shale and sandstone.  Cragola soils are on structural benches, hills, and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically, these soils are calcareous throughout but are noncalcareous in the upper 1 or 2 inches in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Gravel is 35 to 60 percent.  Cobbles are 0 to 20 percent.  The control section is typically very gravelly loam or clay loam.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon, when present, has properties similar to the A horizon with the exception of having subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 1 to 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
