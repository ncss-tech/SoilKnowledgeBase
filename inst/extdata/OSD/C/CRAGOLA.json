  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically, these soils are calcareous throughout but are noncalcareous in the upper 1 or 2 inches in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Gravel is 35 to 60 percent.  Cobbles are 0 to 20 percent.  The control section is typically very gravelly loam or clay loam.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon, when present, has properties similar to the A horizon with the exception of having subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 1 to 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
