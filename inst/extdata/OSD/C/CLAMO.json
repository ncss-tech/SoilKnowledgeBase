  "OVERVIEW": "The Clamo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, poorly drained, and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium on bottom lands.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 24 to 48 inches.  The particle size control section is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  Buried horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry; and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but is silt loam or loam in some pedons where the upper 6 to 10 inches have been modified by recent deposition.  It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It has few or common, faint or distinct redoximorphic features in most pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 2.  It has few or common faint or distinct redoximorphic features.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonate and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It has few or common, faint or distinct redoximorphic features in some pedons.  The C horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, sandy clay loam, or clay loam but is stratified with thin layers of sand or silt in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have sand and gravel at depths below 40 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chivato, Lura, Okoboji, Peotone, Shiloh, Woods Cross, Zoe, and Zook soils in the same family.  The Chivato soils contain more clay, do not have carbonates, and formed in sediments derived from igneous rock.  The Lura soils tend to contain more clay and are in a more moist climate.   The Okoboji, Peotone, and Shiloh soils are in areas of higher rainfall.  Woods Cross soils receive less rainfall and formed in sediments derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Zoe soils receive more rainfall and tend to contain more soluble salts and exchangeable sodium.  Zook soils lack free carbonates to depths of 40 inches or more."

The Clamo soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperatures range from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 17 to 26 inches."

Baltic soils are in depressions and contain free carbonates to the surface.  Bon and Roxbury soils contain less clay and have loamy control sections and are on slightly higher landscapes than the Clamo soils.  Betts soil have a fine-loamy control section and do not have an aquic moisture regime and are on steep adjacent uplands. Durrstein soils have a natric horizon and are on similar landscapes with microrelief.  James, Lamo, and Luton soils are on similar landscapes as the Clamo soil.  James soils have carbonates at or near the surface and contain more salts.  Lamo soils have a fine-silty control section.  Luton soils do not have free carbonates to depths of 36 inches or more and do not contain gypsum."
