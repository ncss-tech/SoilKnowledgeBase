  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Culebra series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in gravelly colluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
