  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Slagle series is the only known soil in the same family.  The Eunola series is in a closely related family.  Slagle and Eunola soils are parallel to the Atlantic Coast and receive considerably less annual precipitation.  In addition, Eunola soils are in a semiactive cation exchange activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chatom soils are on upland ridges and side slopes of the Southern Coastal Plain. They formed in thick beds of loamy and clayey Miocene-age sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 58 to 62 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 70 degrees."

Gritney and Maubila soils have clayey subsoils. The well-drained Rutan soils are coarse-loamy. The somewhat poorly drained Toinette soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 73 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\nAquic conditions - the soil has redox depletions and masses within the upper 27 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year.\nThe laboratory data supports a Hapludult since there is a 29% clay decrease between 12 and 45 inches. The clay content in the 2B/C horizon was not derived from the overlying Bt horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is from the Auburn University Agronomy and Soils Department. Characterization laboratory data is available for the for the typical pedon 10AL-129-004(1-6).\nChatom soils are in MLRA 133A.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
