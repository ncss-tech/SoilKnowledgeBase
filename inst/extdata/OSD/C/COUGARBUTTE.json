  "OVERVIEW": "The Cougarbutte series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in granitic residuum and alluvium. The Cougarbutte soils are on pediments and fan aprons over pediments. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C.",
