  "OVERVIEW": "The Caneyhead series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils. These depressional soils formed in loamy alluvium of Quarternary age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent slope but mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1321 mm (52 in).",
