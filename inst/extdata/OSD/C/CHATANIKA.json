The texture of the upper part of the control section is silt loam with a weighted average of less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay.  This material contains significant amounts of mica but less than 25 percent.  Texture of the lower part of the control section is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2, 2.5 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Organic material is slightly to moderately decomposed, and reaction ranges from extremely to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4; and chroma 1 and 3.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.  Profiles may have lighter colored material from lower in the profile cryoturbated into the A.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid;  boundary is clear to diffuse and irregular or broken.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma 1 and 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. These horizons have brown or black organic stained material cryoturbated in from the A horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cgf horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma 1 or 2. .  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam."
