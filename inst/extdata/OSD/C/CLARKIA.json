  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarkia series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on floodplains, valley floors, and low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
