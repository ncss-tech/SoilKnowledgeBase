  "OVERVIEW": "The Cozy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy calcareous glacial till deposits on ground moraines and drumlins. They are shallow to dense till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and low or moderately low in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated the depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface.) Solum thickness and depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 61 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the solum and 25 to 40 percent in the substratum. Cobble content ranges from 5 to 20 percent throughout the pedon. The fine earth fraction of the particle control section ranges from 2 to 10 percent clay and contains between 50 and 70 percent fine sand or coarser.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or cobbly analogs of these textures. Reaction of the A horizon ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or cobbly analogs of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the cobbly analogs of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or the cobbly analogs of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand or sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is the very gravelly analogues of sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
