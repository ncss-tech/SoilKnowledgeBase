  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabbart series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are on hills, ridges, escarpments, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
