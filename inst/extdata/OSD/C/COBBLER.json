  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cobbler series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. They formed in colluvium and residuum from metamorphic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 15 to 80 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
