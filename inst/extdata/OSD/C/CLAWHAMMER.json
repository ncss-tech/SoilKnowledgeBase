  "OVERVIEW": "The Clawhammer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",

Lute soils have been mapped on interdunes of sandhills and on stream terraces and floodplains of valleys in Sheridan and Holt Counties. The Official Series Description type location for the Lute series is not in the Nebraska sandhills and is in Tripp, County,\nSouth Dakota. Lisco soils were considered during mapping for the coarse-loamy alkali soils in the sandhills in Cherry, Sheridan, and Garden Counties. These were correlated to Wildhorse soils. In Cherry County they were located with saline spot symbols on the Crowther and Cullison soils."
