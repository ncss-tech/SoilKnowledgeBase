Lute soils have been mapped on interdunes of sandhills and on stream terraces and floodplains of valleys in Sheridan and Holt Counties. The Official Series Description type location for the Lute series is not in the Nebraska sandhills and is in Tripp, County,\nSouth Dakota. Lisco soils were considered during mapping for the coarse-loamy alkali soils in the sandhills in Cherry, Sheridan, and Garden Counties. These were correlated to Wildhorse soils. In Cherry County they were located with saline spot symbols on the Crowther and Cullison soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon 08NE005041 which is the typical pedon for the series has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory. Comparison data is also available for the Lute series: pedon 71SD123001 which is the type location for the Lute series and pedon 76NE089005 in Holt County. In Cherry County, Pedon\n89NE031039 was sampled as Cullison and the SSL classified it as coarse-loamy, mixed, subactive, mesic Typic Halaquept.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
