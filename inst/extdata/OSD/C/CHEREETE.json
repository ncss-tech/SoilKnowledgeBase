  "OVERVIEW": "The Chereete series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in outwash, alluvium, or colluvium. These soils are on outwash fans, drainageways, and escarpments. Slopes are 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
