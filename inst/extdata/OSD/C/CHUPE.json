  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chupe soils are on narrow flood plains and flood plain steps of valley floors adjacent to arroyos.  They formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, granitic sandstone, and mudstone.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jaconita, Zepol, and Zia soils.  Jaconita soils are sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Zepol soils are fine-silty, have mollic epipedons, and occur on narrow flood plains.  Zia soils are coarse-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent low stream terraces."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained, negligible surface runoff; permeability is rapid to very rapid in the sandy horizons and moderate to moderately rapid in the loamy horizons.  These soils are subject to occasional, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September.  Floodwaters have high velocity and are generally less than 5 feet deep. There is a rarely flooded phase that would have floodwaters less than 1 foot deep."
