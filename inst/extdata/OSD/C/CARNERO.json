  "OVERVIEW": "The Carnero series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in medium and moderately fine-textured residuum from sandstone with addition of eolian sediments. Carnero soils are on rolling uplands hills, ridges, and nearly level mesa tops and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

The climate is semiarid continental. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches with a summer maximum. The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 53 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
