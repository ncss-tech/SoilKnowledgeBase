  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Carnero soils are on rolling upland hills and ridges and nearly level mesa tops where elevation ranges from 4,300 to 7,000 feet. The soils formed in medium and moderately fine-texture residuum that weathered from noncalcareous sandstone and has had additions of eolian material and calcium carbonate. The climate is semiarid continental. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches with a summer maximum. The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 53 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
