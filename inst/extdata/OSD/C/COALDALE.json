  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 90 percent and are mainly subangular pebbles about one inch diameter or less.  Depth to continuous horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 6 to 15 inches.  Some pedons have a Cr horizon about 3 to 8 inches thick over the lithic contact.\nThe A horizon and transitional B/A horizons, if present, have a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  The fine earth fraction is typically sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 34 percent, and the total sand content ranges from 35 to 70 percent consisting mainly of fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is typically very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in residual material weathered from granite or gneiss.   The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  The mean summer air temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 115 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Borollic Lithic Haplargids to be compatible to the 1994 Amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this soil include an ochric epipedon from 0 to 3 inches; an argillic horizon from 3 to 10 inches; a Bk horizon from 10 to 18 inches; and a lithic contact at 18 inches.  The soil has an ustic aridic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.  Last updated by the state 8/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
