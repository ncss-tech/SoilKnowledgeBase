    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Soils in the same family are Annemaine, Beason, Cid, Craven, Dogue, Eulonia, Gritney, Helena, Lignum, Nemours, Nevarc, Newco, Peawick, Rosenwall, Sacul, Stapp, Vinita, and Wolftever. Soils in closely related families are Altavista, Brickhaven, Carbonton, Conasauga, Granville, Green Level, Polkton, and White Store series. Altavista soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Annemaine, Conasauga, Sacul, Polkton, and White Store soils contain higher clay content in the upper Bt horizon. Beason and Eulonia soils have low shrink-swell potential. Brickhaven and Carbonton soils contain less clay and more silt in the subsoil, In addition, Brickhaven soils\nhave depth to paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and Carbonton soils have depth to paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Cid soils have moderate shrink-swell potential and a paralithic contact at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Craven, Dogue, Gritney, Lignum, Nemours, and Wolftever soils have moderate shrink-swell potential. Also, Beason, Craven, and Wolftever soils commonly have less fine or coarser sand in upper Bt horizon. Granville soils lack low chroma iron depletions within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon and have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Helena soils formed from residuum of felsic to mafic, crystalline, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Nevarc soils have slow permeability in the lower half of the Bt horizon. Newco and Stapp soils have colors in shades of red in the upper Bt horizon. Peawick soils formed in alluvium and are not underlain by saprolite. Green Level, Polkton and White Store soils have very firm and very plastic Bt horizons with slickensides. In addition, Polkton soils have paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Rosenwall and Vinita soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Creedmoor soils are on nearly level to moderately steep slopes in the Triassic Basins. Rocks are of Triassic age. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils have formed in materials weathered from fine sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, shale, and conglomerate. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 55 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F."
