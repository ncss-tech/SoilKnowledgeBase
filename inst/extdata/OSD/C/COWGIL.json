Basket, Breko and Chiefrange soils receive 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. The Drino, Lithgow, and Schader soils are less than 100 cm deep to bedrock. The Hefed, Huilepass, and Hunewill soils have a combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons that is less than 50 cm. Jungo soils have combined thickness of A and B horizons of more than 100 cm, have Btk horizons at depths of 13 to 25 cm, contain carbonates coating on rocks at 13to 25 cm and have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 12 degrees C. Kayo soils have 13 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Plush and Stucky soils have neutral argillic horizons and lack Bk horizon beneath the argillic. Washoe soils are slightly acid or neutral and do not have a Ck horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cowgil series are on fan remnants and hills. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from volcanic and quartzite sources and in some areas colluvium derived from shale, rhyolite or welded tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,680 to 2,080 meters in Nevada and are 750 to 1,050 meters in Idaho. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C. and 9 to 11 degrees C. in Idaho, and the frost-free season is normally 100 to 130 days and ranges up to 140 days in Idaho."
