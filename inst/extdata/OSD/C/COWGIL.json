  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowgil series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived volcanic and quartzite and in some areas colluvium derived from shale, rhyolite or welded tuffs. The Cowgil soils are on fan remnants and hills. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Basket, Breko and Chiefrange soils receive 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. The Drino, Lithgow, and Schader soils are less than 100 cm deep to bedrock. The Hefed, Huilepass, and Hunewill soils have a combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons that is less than 50 cm. Jungo soils have combined thickness of A and B horizons of more than 100 cm, have Btk horizons at depths of 13 to 25 cm, contain carbonates coating on rocks at 13to 25 cm and have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 12 degrees C. Kayo soils have 13 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Plush and Stucky soils have neutral argillic horizons and lack Bk horizon beneath the argillic. Washoe soils are slightly acid or neutral and do not have a Ck horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation."
