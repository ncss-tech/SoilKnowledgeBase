  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches, and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Fragments of gravel-sized sandstone, shale, or siltstone range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum, and from 0 to 50 percent in the\nC horizon. Unless limed, the reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have A horizons that have value of 3, but these horizons are generally less than 7 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, brown, and red.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors like the Bt horizon, and others have lower Btg or BCg horizons that are gleyed. A few pedons have 2B horizons in the lower solum.\nThe C, Cg or 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8, or is neutral with value of 4 through 8. These horizons are often variegated with redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and red, without a clearly dominant matrix color. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam. The C horizons in some pedons are stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Adelphia, Blairton, Holmdel, Kensington, Trackler, Wharton, Whiteside, and Woodstown series in the same family, and the Delanco, Dillard and tentative Russet series, differing only in cation-exchange activity class. Additionally, series that have not been assigned an activity class include Bigpool, Fenwick and Tuscarawas. Adelphia, Holmdel, Russet, and Woodstown formed from marine, fluvio-marine, or deltaic parent materials. Adelphia and Holmdel soils also contain glauconite. Russett and Woodstown soils also contain quartz pebbles or ironstone fragments. Bigpool overlaps the Cotaco series considerably but generally has a more shallow solum range, lower rock fragment content range and does not allow 2.5Y hues. Blairton and Fenwick are less than 40 inches to bedrock. Delanco, Dillard, and Whiteside are derived from crystalline rocks and have flakes of mica.  Kensington soils have a lithologic discontinuity consisting of glacial till over residuum. Trackler soils formed from material weathered from fine-grained igneous rocks and are less than 60 inches to bedrock. Tuscarawas soils have a lithologic discontinuity and have clayey textures in the substratum. Wharton soils are formed from sedimentary residuum and generally have more silt."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foot slopes, colluvial fans, and low stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 20 percent. The regolith is alluvium of acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale origin. Near the type location, the average annual precipitation is 42 to 54 inches, and average annual air temperature is 47 to 57 degrees F."

Allegheny, Jefferson, and Shelocta soils lack redoximorphic depletions in the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon. Monongahela soils have a fragipan. Dekalb, Pope, and Stendal soils lack argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 4/2002 revision updates this series to 8th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards. Redoximorphic feature terminology and competing series were also updated at this time. Cation-exchange class placement is based on both pedon S78KY-121-3 and on geographically related soils such as Allegheny. The CEC/clay ratio of .27 for this pedon indicates a semiactive class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon - The zone from approximately 10 to 41 inches (BA, Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nc. Redoximorphic features - occurring within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon (Aquic subgroup).\nLaboratory data for the series includes pedon S78KY-121-3, analyzed by the University of Kentucky.\nMLRAs: 124, 125, 126, 127 and 147.\nRevised: 4/94-JHN, CWH, JMR; 4/2002-ABJ, DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
