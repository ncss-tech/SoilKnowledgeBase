  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Culvop soils are on mountains that generally have a northerly aspect.  Slopes are 30 to 65 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentine mixed with volcanic ash.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,800 feet.  They are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 59 degrees.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 100 to 130 days."
