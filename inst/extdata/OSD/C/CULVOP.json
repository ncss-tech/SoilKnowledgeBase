  "OVERVIEW": "The Culvop series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentine mixed with volcanic ash.  Culvop soils are on mountainsides at elevations of 5,000 to 6,800 feet.  Slopes are 30 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 59 degrees.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 100 to 130 days."

This soil was formerly called Culving Variant.  This draft reflects a change in classification due to Andisols order from medial-skeletal Lithic Entic Cryandepts to ashy-skeletal Lithic Vitricryands."
