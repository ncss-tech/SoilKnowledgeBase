  "OVERVIEW": "The Cypher series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from acid igneous rocks on convex mountain sides and ridge crests.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
