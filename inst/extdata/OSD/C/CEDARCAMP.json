  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentinized peridotite or serpentinized metaigneous rock types.  Cedarcamp soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are  0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 145 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
