  "OVERVIEW": "The Catalpa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on flood plains or low terraces of streams that drain areas of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 135A). They formed in clayey alluvium. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 63 degrees, F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

These soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from uplands of the Blackland Prairie. The somewhat poorly drained Belden soils are on similar to lower positions, have fine-silty control sections and do not have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Griffith soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are Vertisols. The somewhat poorly drained Houlka soils are on similar positions, are acidic throughout, do not have mollic epipedons and are Vertisols. The somewhat poorly drained Leeper soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and do not have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Marietta soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, have fine-loamy control sections and do not have Mollic epipedons. The poorly drained Tuscumbia and Una soils are on adjacent lower areas and sloughs and do not have mollic epipedons."
