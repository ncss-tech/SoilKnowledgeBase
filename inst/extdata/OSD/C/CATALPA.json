    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catalpa soils are on flood plains or low terraces along streams that drain the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie.  They formed in clayey alluvial sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 51 inches and the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees Fahrenheit near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Belden, Griffith, Houlka, Leeper, Marietta, Tuscumbia and Una soils. These soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from uplands of the Blackland Prairie. The somewhat poorly drained Belden soils are on similar to lower positions, have fine-silty control sections and do not have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Griffith soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are Vertisols. The somewhat poorly drained Houlka soils are on similar positions, are acidic throughout, do not have mollic epipedons and are Vertisols. The somewhat poorly drained Leeper soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and do not have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Marietta soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, have fine-loamy control sections and do not have Mollic epipedons. The poorly drained Tuscumbia and Una soils are on adjacent lower areas and sloughs and do not have mollic epipedons."

Catalpa soils are subject to either occasional or frequent flooding for brief duration late in winter and early in spring.\nCatalpa soils are in MLRA 135A.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http;://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data was sampled and provided by the National Soil Survey laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nEngineering test data for the typical profile are published in the Soil Survey of Lee County, Mississippi (issued March 1973) pp. 54-55.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
