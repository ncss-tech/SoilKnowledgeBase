  "OVERVIEW": "The Cloudyway series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent in mountain valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
