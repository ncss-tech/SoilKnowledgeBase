Bearthicket soils have an argillic horizon and are on slightly higher landscape postions. Claiborne and Waben soils have argillic horizons and are on foot slopes or stream terraces.  Clarksville, Crider, Doniphan, and Goss soils have argillic horizons and are on uplands.  Union and Viraton soils have fragipans and are on uplands."
