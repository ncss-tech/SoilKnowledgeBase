  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedargap series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium with a high content of chert fragments.  These soils are on flood plains of small streams near active channels.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.",
