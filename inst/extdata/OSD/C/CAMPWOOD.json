    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in rangeland.  The remainder is used for cropland  or wildlife. The major crops are forage sorghums and small grains. The climax plant community is a tall grass prairie.  The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other plants include sideoats grama, vine mesquite, yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, Canada wildrye, live oak, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, hairy wedelia, Texas cupgrass, tall dropseed, and plains lovegrass.  The dominant forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and bushsunflower. The woody plants include elm, live oak, hackberry, bumelia, green briar and elbowbush. With heavy stocking rates, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of tumblegrass, hairy tridens, Texas grama, red threeawn, western ragweed, broomweed, prairie coneflower, and Ashe juniper."
