The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. Rock fragments in the control section range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 5 to 20 percent by volume of shot 2 to 5 mm. in diameter.\nThe BA and Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is heavy or clay loam with 25 to 32 percent clay. This horizon has moderate fine to medium subangular blocky structure."

Summers are warm and dry with average July temperature of 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. Winters are cool and moist with average January temperature of 31 degrees to 34 degrees F. and a mean annual temperature of 47 degrees to 51 degrees F.
