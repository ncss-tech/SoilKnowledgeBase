  "OVERVIEW": "The Cooperopolis series consists of shallow, well drained soils on north-facing side slopes or tilted plateaus.  They formed in ash and loess over fractured volcanic tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  When present, depth to secondary carbonates is 10 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages less than 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 5 to 20 percent glass with acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.2 to 0.5.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, when present, has colors similar to the 2Bt horizon.  It is clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It has less than 1 percent organic matter."

Borland soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Jilson soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Laric soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and has a soil reaction of neutral or slightly alkaline.  Malinda soils have a xeric moisture regime.  McQuarrie soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Pass Canyon soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Terca soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and has a soil reaction of slightly alkaline or neutral.  Yrtneg soils have a xeric moisture regime."
