    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. (aridic).  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  When present, depth to secondary carbonates is 10 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages less than 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 5 to 20 percent glass with acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.2 to 0.5.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, when present, has colors similar to the 2Bt horizon.  It is clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It has less than 1 percent organic matter."

All these soils except Yrtneg lack vitrandic properties in the surface horizons.  Adinot soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Borland soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Jilson soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Laric soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and has a soil reaction of neutral or slightly alkaline.  Malinda soils have a xeric moisture regime.  McQuarrie soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Pass Canyon soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Terca soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and has a soil reaction of slightly alkaline or neutral.  Yrtneg soils have a xeric moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cooperopolis soils are on north-facing slopes of tilted plateaus or side slopes.  This soil formed in ash and loess over fractured volcanic tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 1,400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."
