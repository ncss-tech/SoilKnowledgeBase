  "OVERVIEW": "The Coski series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on forested mountain slopes. They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from intermediate intrusive bedrock. Slopes are 10 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
