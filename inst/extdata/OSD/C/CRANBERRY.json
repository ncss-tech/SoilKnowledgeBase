  "OVERVIEW": "The Cranberry series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over basalt residuum with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on hills on lava plateaus.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 5 to 55 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
