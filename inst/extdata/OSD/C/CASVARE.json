  "OVERVIEW": "The Casvare series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  Casvere soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
