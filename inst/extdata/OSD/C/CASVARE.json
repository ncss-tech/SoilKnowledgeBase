Oe horizons are generally present, but are absent in some pedons.  A paralithic contact is at a depth of 6 to 20 inches.  A lithic contact is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 4 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 90 percent.
