  "OVERVIEW": "The Casvare series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  Casvere soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Oe horizons are generally present, but are absent in some pedons.  A paralithic contact is at a depth of 6 to 20 inches.  A lithic contact is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 4 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 90 percent.  Content of fine or coarser sand is 35 percent or greater.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."
