The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The A1 horizon has 15 to 20 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The A2 and A3 horizon is loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 10 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Crutchfield soils are on stable to metastable broad ridgetops, benches, and side slopes of forested mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.   Elevation is 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
