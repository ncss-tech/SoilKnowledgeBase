  "OVERVIEW": "The Crutchfield series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Crutchfield soils are on broad ridgetops, benches, and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The A1 horizon has 15 to 20 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The A2 and A3 horizon is loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.
