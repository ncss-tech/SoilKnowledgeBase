  "OVERVIEW": "The Claysprings series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, residuum, and alluvium derived from shale, siltstone, and mudstone.  Claysprings soils are on plateaus, knobs, ridges, hills, and canyons.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
