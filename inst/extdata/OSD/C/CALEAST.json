Fragments of limestone range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4. Value dry is less than 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have thin BE or BA horizons up to 8 inches thick with colors and textures similar to the upper Bt.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has similar colors, but commonly has lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nA BC or C horizon with textures similar to the lower Bt is in some pedons. It is commonly variegated without dominant hue or chroma and includes chroma of 2 or less."
