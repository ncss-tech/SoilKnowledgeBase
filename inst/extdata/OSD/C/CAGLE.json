Bucklake and Perla soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Correco, Jasseek, Northmore, and Schoer soils are very deep.  Holmzie soils are influenced by volcanic ash with vitrandic intergrade properties in the upper 18 cm.  Sherar soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section, have a component of loess in the parent material, and have an argillic horizon that has very firm consistence when moist.  Wicup soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the particle-size control section.  Zymans are deep and very deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cagle soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on south and west-facing footslope and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from andesitic rock, metavolcanics, or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,225 to 2,135 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
