  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Choska series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on low terraces of flood plains.  They formed in predominantly loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
