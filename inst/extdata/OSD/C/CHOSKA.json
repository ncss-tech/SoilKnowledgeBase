Choska soils formed in loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1168 mm (36 to 46 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 14 to 20 degrees C (57 to 68 degrees F).  Elevation is 170 to 255 meters (558 to 837 feet) above mean sea level.  Annual Thornthwaite P-E indicies range from 64 to 80."

Kiomatia soils are lower in position and lack a mollic epipedon and have sandy textures in the control section.  Latanier soils are on the back part of the terrace, have vertic properties, and a clayey over loamy control section.  Mason soils have an argillic horizon with more than 18 percent clay in the control section."
