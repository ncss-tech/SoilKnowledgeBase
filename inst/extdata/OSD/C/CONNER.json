  "STATES": "ID,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Conner series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone and rhyolite with loess influence.  Conner soils are on mountain slopes and shoulders of canyons and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.5 degrees C.",
