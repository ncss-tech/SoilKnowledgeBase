  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 10YR, in chroma from neutral to 2, and in value from 5.5 to 7 when dry and 3.5 to 5 when moist. Hue of the G horizon may range from 2.5Y to 10Y. The depth to the underlying sand and gravel substratum may range from 12 to 40 inches, and the depth to the fluctuating water table may range from 0 to 24 inches depending upon the season of the year.  Evidence of poor drainage in the surface A horizon may range from a uniform gleyed color to moderate or weak mottling. Texture of the C horizon may range in clay from 20 to 40 percent, in silt from 0 to 60 percent, and in sand from 20 to 60 percent. Combinations of characteristics not entirely within the range listed above but representative of the normal physical and chemical character, and the kind and degree of genesis normally attributed to these soils should not be excluded for lack of total conformity."
