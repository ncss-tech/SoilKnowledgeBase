  "OVERVIEW": "This series consists of very poorly or poorly drained, moderately fine textured, noncalcareous, Wiesenbodens developing in depressions on high terraces in old outwash fans, or poorly drained outwash channels, in moderately coarse textured, gleyed, neutral to mildly alkaline alluvium or glacial outwash sediments derived mainly from granite, quartzite, gneiss, and sandstone bedrocks, and overlying coarse sand and gravel substratum. Normally these soils have light colored, gleyed, thin A horizons, no textural B horizons, and thin to moderately thick, gleyed, C horizons overlying clean sand and gravel substratum.  At their type location they are developing in an area having average annual precipitation of 12 inches, an average annual snowfall of 50 inches, a mean annual temperature of 35 degrees, and a mean summer temperature of 56.6 degrees. They occur in association with the soils of the New fork series from which they differ from being finer textured, more strongly gleyed, and lighter colored. They differ from the Dagmar soils in being finer textured, and in being noncalcareous or very weakly calcareous.  They differ from the Teepee soils in being lighter colored and strongly gleyed. These are relatively unimportant soils of low agricultural value occurring in the high mountain areas of the western states.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 10YR, in chroma from neutral to 2, and in value from 5.5 to 7 when dry and 3.5 to 5 when moist. Hue of the G horizon may range from 2.5Y to 10Y. The depth to the underlying sand and gravel substratum may range from 12 to 40 inches, and the depth to the fluctuating water table may range from 0 to 24 inches depending upon the season of the year.  Evidence of poor drainage in the surface A horizon may range from a uniform gleyed color to moderate or weak mottling. Texture of the C horizon may range in clay from 20 to 40 percent, in silt from 0 to 60 percent, and in sand from 20 to 60 percent. Combinations of characteristics not entirely within the range listed above but representative of the normal physical and chemical character, and the kind and degree of genesis normally attributed to these soils should not be excluded for lack of total conformity."
