The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches, the average annual air temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F and the frost free season is 70 to 95 days."

Arbone, Iphil and Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section and are not pachic.  Brifox soils lack a mollic epipedon and average 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Rexburg and Iphil soils are on loess covered fan terraces and hillslopes above Chinhill soils.  Arbone soils are on smooth slopes on tops of hills.  Brifox soils are on hillsides and lake terraces."
