    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 124 cm (18 to 49 in). Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from 5 throough 55 percent in the mineral surface and subsurface layers, from 15 to 65 percent in the subsoil, and from 35 to 70 percent in the C horizon.\nSome undisturbed pedons have an O horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is up to 20 cm (8 in) thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has granular structure or it is structureless. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid unless limed. Some pedons have a thin A horizon with chroma of 0 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have thin horizons of fine sandy loam. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bhs, or Bh, horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have thin horizons of fine sandy loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive. It is very friable or friable, with or without cemented masses. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons are coarse sandy loam in the upper part. Some pedons have thin horizons of fine sandy loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive or single grain. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have a CB horizon with properties similar to the BC.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is composed of gravel, cobbles, or stones with coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or sand in the interstices and has varying degrees of stratification. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hermon, Masardis, and Stetson series. Hermon soils formed in till and are not stratified in the lower part of the substratum. Marsardis soils have rock fragments usually dominated by slate and phyllite, and have a loamy mantle greater than 25 cm (10 in) thick. Stetson soils have loamy B horizons.\nConstable, Success, and Trout River series are similar soils in related families. Constable and Success soils have ortstein. Trout River soils are Entic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colton soils are on glacial outwash terraces, plains, kames, and eskers. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in water-sorted sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones typically derived from granite with lesser amounts of sandstone and schist. Mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 46 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in), and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 1.5 to 914 m (5 to 3000 ft) above sea level."

Becket, Hermon, and Worth soils formed in till on nearby uplands. Constable soils are common associates where ortstein layers are prominent. Duane soils are moderately well drained on lower, nearby landscapes."

This should be corrected in the MLRA update process.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Albic horizon - the zone from 18 to 20 cm (7 to 8 in) (E horizon).\n3. Spodic horizon - the zone from 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) (Bhs and Bs horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
