  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The combined thickness of the Ag, Bssg, and Bssk horizons is more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. On drying, large cracks extend as deep as 48 inches and form large prisms. The cracks open and close at least once each year and are open by June or July and are closed by October or November. Various amounts of undecomposed plant material and surface soil are in these cracks. Common to many slickensides are in the zone from 12 to 48 inches. In some pedons moderate amounts of plant remains are in the lower part of the Ag horizon and the upper part of the Bssg horizon as well as in tongues of the Ag horizon extending in to the Bssg horizon. These soils have a calcium to magnesium ratio of more than 2.\nThe Ag and Bssg horizons have 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue or is of neutral hue; value ranges from 2 through 5. Chromas are 1 or 0 moist and dry. Moist values are 1 or 2 units darker. In some pedons, colors are mottled with hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 3 to 5 and chromas of 2 to 6. In other pedons concretions of Fe and Mn are present. These horizons range from moderately acid to moderately alkaline (pH 5.6 to 8.4) in the upper part and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and calcareous in the lower part. The more acid surfaces are probably the result of cultural practices, especially extensive use of fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals. In areas adjacent to streams or sloughs, there is an overwash of stratified fine sandy loam or silty clay loam. Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Bssk horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue or is neutral; value ranges from 3 through 6 and chroma from 1 through 6; colors are mottled with hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y and 5Y. This horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline and is usually calcareous with segregations of accumulated lime in soft masses or seams. In some pedons the lower part is stratified and noncalcareous. Texture is silty clay or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carhart, Copus, Dodgeland, and Hildreth series. Carhart soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic material. Hildreth soils overlie unrelated material and are somewhat poorly drained. Copus soils have neutral pH. Dodgeland soils have hue of 10YR and less than 40 percent clay in some horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clear Lake soils are in flood basins, flood plains and in swales of drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 5 to 2,000 feet. The soils formed in fine textured alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The soils are in a dry subhumid climate of relatively hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 35 inches. Mean January temperature varies from 42 degrees to 47 degrees F., mean July temperature varies from 69 degrees to 72 degrees F., and mean annual temperature varies from 58 degrees to 62 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 300 days. Cooler temperatures and a shorter frost-free season occurs in Lake County."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cropley, Antioch, Capay, Pacheco, Salinas and San Ysidro soils. Antioch soils have natric horizons. Capay soils have a chroma of 2 or more throughout. Cropley soils have chromas of 1.5 or more within 40 inches. Pacheco and Salinas soils have a mollic epipedon and have less than 35 percent clay. San Ysidro soils have an ochric epipedon and lack cracks and slickensides."

A water table is at depths of 4 to 10 feet in the late summer and in some areas is very near the surface during wet months of winter. Some areas are artificially drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Hildreth soils are currently listed in the same family. As currently described, Hildreth soils would not classify as Vertisols. A part of the Hildreth soils may belong to another series or different subgroup. More study of the Hildreth soils is needed to accurately classify these soils. In future MLRA updates Clear Lake mapped in MLRA 17 should be separated from acreage mapped in MLRA 14 (Coast Range Valleys). Differentia in this family is weak and has overlapping colors, plus marginal separations based on reaction classes, salinity and other factors.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 45 inches\nSlickensides - 19 to 60 inches\nReduced matrix - 0 to 45 inches\nRedox concentrations - 0 to 13 inches and 19 to 60 inches\nSecondary carbonates - 45 to 60 inches\nAquic conditions - 0 to 60 inches\nSeries classification updated May 1996. Competing series not reviewed at that time.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Two pedons in Sonoma County, CA: S61CA-097-009 (40A-3087), at 38 degrees north latitude, 14 minutes, 54 seconds, 122 degrees West longitude, 36 minutes, 31 seconds; and S61CA-097-010 (40A-3088), at 38 degrees North latitude, 16 minutes, 14 seconds, 122 West longitude, 38 minutes, 38 seconds. Two pedons in Solano County: NSSL pedon S79CA-095-000-000 (type location) and S91CA-099-005 (partial pedon). One pedon in Colusa County: S89CA-011-005.\nRunoff terminology adjusted 5/96 to the adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nEdits made for SDJR projects 12/2014 - AEC\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
