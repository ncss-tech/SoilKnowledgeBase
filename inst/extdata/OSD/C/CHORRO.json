  "OVERVIEW": "The Chorro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Chorro soils are on flood plains, basin floors, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
