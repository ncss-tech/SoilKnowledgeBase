  "OVERVIEW": "The Cestnik series is a member of the clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, montmorillonitic (calcareous), mesic family of Typic Torriorthents. Typically, Cestnik soils have very pale brown, very friable, granular, calcareous A horizons, pink, calcareous, silty clay C horizons over beds of sand and gravel at a depth of 24 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand, gravel, and cobbles ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 degrees to 50 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 68 degrees F. Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches. Some pedons have some visible secondary carbonate and/or calcium sulfate accumulation.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Rock fragments of gravel and cobble size range from 0 to 35 percent above the IIC horizon. The upper part of the control section has 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 45 percent sand. The A and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

Greybull soils have a fine-loamy control section and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Stutzman soils have a fine control section. Teapo soils have a fine-loamy control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Cestnik soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 3,800 to 5,200 feet. Slopes typically range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in moderately thin, calcareous, silty alluvial materials mainly from sedimentary rocks that mantle sand, gravel, and cobble alluvium. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."

Garland soils have argillic horizons. Lostwells and Youngston soils lack sand, gravel, and cobble beds at depths of less than 40 inches."
