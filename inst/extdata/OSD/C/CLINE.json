    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bylas (T) (AZ), Crosgrain (NV), Gotchell (AZ), Greyeagle (CA), Longjim (NV), Marsite (CA), and Tumarion (AZ) series.  Bylas soils are shallow to limestone bedrock, have secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate, and are dominated by calcrete flagstones.  Crosgrain, Gotchell, Greyeagle, Longjim, Marsite, and Tumarion soils precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert (MLRA 30) and are moist for less than 20 cumulative days during July-September.  In addition Crossgrain and Greyeagle soils do not have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches; Gotchell soils are shallow to fanglomerate bedrock; Longjim soils do not have bedrock within 20 inches and have less than 10 percent clay; and Marsite soils have less than 12 percent clay."
