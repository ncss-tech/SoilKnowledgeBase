  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinwhisker series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on stream terraces, outwash plains, and lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
