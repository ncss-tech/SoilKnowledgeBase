(0 to 8 inches thick)\nCr--9+ inches; hard, acid, horizontally bedded claystone; claystone is grayish brown or light yellowish brown with streaks or splotches of strong brown and yellowish brown; claystone is discontinuous but there is no evidence of root penetration or soil material within fractures which are usually more than 12 inches apart; few fine flakes of mica; material is extremely difficult to chip with spade; very strongly acid."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of consolidated rock ranges from 5 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid in the solum to extremely acid in the underlying rock.  Fragments range from few to many on the surface and range from 2 mm to 45 cm in diameter.  These fragments are dominantly angular and have a wide range in degrees of hardness.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is less than 5 inches thick when value is less than 4.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A horizon is cobbly sandy loam, cobbly loam, or cobbly silt loam.  Content of rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume and from 2 mm to 45 cm in diameter.\nThe C horizon, where present, is more than 75 percent fragments of claystone with hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or more, and chroma of more than 1.  These fragments may contain streaks or splotches of strong brown, yellowish brown, olive yellow, or pale olive.  Texture of the soil material in this horizon is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and is usually present as coatings or thin layers between rock faces.  Diameter of fragments range from 2 mm to 45 cm.\nThe Cr horizon is horizontally bedded claystone.  Color and texture are the same as the fragments in the C horizon.  Thickness of the harder material ranges from 3 to 15 inches.  This layer is extremely difficult to chip with spade.  Overall thickness of the interbedded rock layers is usually greater than 6 feet and it is rippable.  It is massive but may be broken, angular cobbly rock structure is some pedons.  There is no soil material or coating between these fractures, neither is there evidence of root penetration."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cantuche soils are on gently rolling to rolling, narrow ridgetops and on steeper sideslopes and benches of dissected uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Slopes are mainly 5 to 25 percent but range from 2 percent on the narrow ridgetops to 35 percent on the steeper sideslopes.  These soils formed over the Tallahatta formation, locally known as Buhrstone rock.  Near the type location the average annual precipitation is 56 inches and the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees"

Bama and Smithdale soils have thick Bt horizons with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Lauderdale soils have fine-loamy control sections and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Troup soils have thick sandy epipedons."
