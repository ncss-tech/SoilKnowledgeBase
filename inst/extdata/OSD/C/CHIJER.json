    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision changes the classification form coarse-loamy to coarse-silty.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 48 inches (Bk, Bkq1, Bkq2, Bkq3, Bkq4, Bkq5 horizons)\nDurinodic Xeric feature - the zone from 16 to 24 inches - contains a layer greater than 7 inches thick with more than 20 percent durinodes (Bkq2 and Bkq3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil has been sampled by NSSL.  The soil survey sample number is S87ID-047-001 and the pedon number is 88P1.  Placement into coarse-silty based on silt plus very fine sand equals 80 to 90 percent and clay is 3 to 16 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
