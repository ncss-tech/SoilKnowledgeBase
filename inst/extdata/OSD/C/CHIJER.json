  "OVERVIEW": "The Chijer series consists of deep to a duripan or very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian influenced alluvium.  Chijer soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
