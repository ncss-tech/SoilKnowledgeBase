  "OVERVIEW": "The Campbellhills series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basalt.  Campbellhills soils are in joint fractures on tops of basalt plateaus in volcanic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, (635 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, (17 degrees C).",
