  "OVERVIEW": "The Cinderhurst series consists of very shallow, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra.  Cinderhurst soils are on basalt plains, and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The permeability is moderate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soil formed in wind deposited volcanic tephra.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

Deerhorn soils are moderately deep to a duripan and basalt bedrock.  McCarey soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  All of these soils occur on much older basalt flows on basalt plains."
