  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cinderhurst soils are on recent basalt plains and associated with lava flows.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 6,000 feet.  The soil formed in wind deposited volcanic tephra.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

Deerhorn soils are moderately deep to a duripan and basalt bedrock.  McCarey soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  All of these soils occur on much older basalt flows on basalt plains."
