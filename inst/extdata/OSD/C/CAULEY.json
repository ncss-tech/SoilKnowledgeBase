  "OVERVIEW": "The Cauley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in floodwater alluvium and loess. Cauley soils are on scoured floodwater terraces and hillsides. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
