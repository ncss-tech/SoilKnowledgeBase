  "OVERVIEW": "The Coils series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a strongly cemented duripan. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Coils soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to l5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
