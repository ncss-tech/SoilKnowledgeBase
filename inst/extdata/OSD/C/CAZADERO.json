    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer and has a udic moisture regime.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum commonly is 60 inches or more but ranges to 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or heavy silt loam.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay and averages about 45 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Below the upper 20 inches or the 2Bt horizon the clay ranges to 60 percent in individual horizons.  It is underlain by variegated weathered rock fragments of mixed origin and occasionally weathered andesite at depths commonly more than 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cazadero soils are on mountainous areas with moderate to strong slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Aspect is generally west, some northwest, some southwest but dominantly toward the west at 600 to 1,500 feet elevation.  The soils formed in very old mixed alluvium that has been influenced by local mountain glaciers from Mt. Hood.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The average July temperature is 65 degrees F; average January temperature is 37 degrees F; average annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F; and the average annual rainfall ranges from 60 to 85 inches.  The frost-free season is 140 to 200 days."
