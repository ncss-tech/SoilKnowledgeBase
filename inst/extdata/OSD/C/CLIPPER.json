These soils have soil temperature of less than 41 degrees F when the water table is above 20 inches of depth.  Characterization data are available on these soils.  Laboratory number S81WA-073-1.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches, an albic horizon from 9 to 22 inches, and a spodic horizon from 22 to 30 inches.  The albic and spodic horizons have mottles with a chroma of 2 or less.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria but does have micro morphology, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets."
