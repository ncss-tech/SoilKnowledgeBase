By weighted average the solum has 10 to 18 percent clay and the particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments increase with depth averaging 2 to 20 percent in the Bs horizon and 25 to 60 percent in the 2Bs horizons.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Mottles have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry.  It is silt loam, loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry, and is mottled.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.

The soils formed in loess, volcanic ash and glacial outwash.  Clipper soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees .  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

These soils have soil temperature of less than 41 degrees F when the water table is above 20 inches of depth.  Characterization data are available on these soils.  Laboratory number S81WA-073-1.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches, an albic horizon from 9 to 22 inches, and a spodic horizon from 22 to 30 inches.  The albic and spodic horizons have mottles with a chroma of 2 or less.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria but does have micro morphology, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
