    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chilojo soils are on footslopes of undulating plateaus. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale of the Triassic Age Chinle Formation. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Clovis soils have a calcic horizon and occur on backslopes and footslopes. Ildefonso soils are loamy-skeletal, have a calcic horizon, and occur on shoulders and backslopes. Kinsell soils are fine-silty, have a mollic epipedon, and are on floodplains and channels of valley floors."
