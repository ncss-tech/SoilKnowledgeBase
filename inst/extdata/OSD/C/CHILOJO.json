  "OVERVIEW": "The Chilojo series consists of well drained soils that are very deep to a densic contact. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Chilojo soils are on footslopes of undulating plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
