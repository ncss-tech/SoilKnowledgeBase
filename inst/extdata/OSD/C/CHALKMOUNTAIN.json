These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone of the Franciscan Complex and the Yager terrain. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2280 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 280 days.  These soils are thought to be in areas which were previously grasslands and have been invaded by Douglas-fir."
