    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The upper mantle is 20 to less than 40 inches thick. Rock fragments, by volume, range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper part and 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the underlying till. A gravelly lag line up to 5 inches thick may occur at the contact of the upper mantle and the till. Rock fragments range to 35 percent, by volume, in this horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. The dry color value is 6 or more after mixing to a depth of 7 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand. The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. Thin lamellae may occur in this horizon.\nThe E/B horizon has less than 15 percent of each horizon present. The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand or sand. The Bt part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The loamy textures occur as 2Bt material. The reaction of this horizon is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin B/E, 2B/E, E & Bt, or 2E/B horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. The reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Redox feature are present.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. Carbonate threads or masses are common to many. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Redox features are present.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with loamy or silty textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The moist bulk density is 1.4 to 1.6 g/cc. Redox features are present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cutaway soils are on convex surfaces on moraines, lake washed till plains and glacial beach ridges. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in a sandy glacial outwash or eolian mantle and underlying calcareous, loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free days range from 88 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1,400 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (A and E horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 3 to 14 inches (E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 31 to 39 inches (2Bt1 horizons); Arenic Oxyaquic subgroup based on saturation within 100 centimeters and a sandy mantle 31 inches thick.\nRedox features and piezometer data supports this classification.\nThis series previously allowed various types of parent materials and properties. The Cutaway series is being restricted to fine-loamy, calcareous glacial till, predominantly of the Des Moines lobe. The type location was moved to Koochiching County, Minnesota to better represent the central concept of the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
