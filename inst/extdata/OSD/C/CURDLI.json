    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Typic Aridic.\nDepth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  Mineralogy is carbonatic and is dominated by diatomaceous earth.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  The control section ranges from loam to silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in very strongly calcareous mixed lake sediments dominated by diatomaceous earth.  The climate is arid, with an average annual precipitation of 6 to 8 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F.  The frost free season is 115 to 140 days."
