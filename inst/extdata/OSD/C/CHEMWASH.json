  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chemwash series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and/or metamorphic rocks. Chemwash soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, alluvial fans and drainageways. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (about 3 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).",

Carrizo and Carrwash soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the moisture control section. Carrwash soils have a MAST of 22 to 24 degrees C. Carrizo and Rizzo soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel with  more than half of the rock fragments being medium gravel-sized or larger. Descent soils are dominated by channers and flagstones and have a calcium carbonate equivalent between 5 and 15 percent throughout the series control section. Goldenhills soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 22 to 25 degrees C, formed in colluvium and residuum, are deep to a lithic contact and have a C horizon with greater than 80 percent cover at the soil surface."
