Carrizo and Carrwash soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the moisture control section. Carrwash soils have a MAST of 22 to 24 degrees C. Carrizo and Rizzo soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel with  more than half of the rock fragments being medium gravel-sized or larger. Descent soils are dominated by channers and flagstones and have a calcium carbonate equivalent between 5 and 15 percent throughout the series control section. Goldenhills soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 22 to 25 degrees C, formed in colluvium and residuum, are deep to a lithic contact and have a C horizon with greater than 80 percent cover at the soil surface."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and/or metamorphic rocks. Elevations are 140 to 835 meters (about 460 to 2,740 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (about 2 to 4 inches); mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (about 73 to 79 degrees F), and the frost free season is 360 to 365 days."
