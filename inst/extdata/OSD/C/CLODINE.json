  "OVERVIEW": "The Clodine series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments of the Lissie Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils occur on flats on coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but are mainly less than 0.3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
