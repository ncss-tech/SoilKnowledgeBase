The well drained Alexandria soils are on summits and side slopes along drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Bennington soils are on summits. The very poorly drained Condit soils are in depressions. The very poorly drained Pewamo soils have mollic epipedons and are in depressions. Bogart, Chili, and Jimtown soils are on outwash terraces. Chagrin, Holly, Lobdell, Orrville, Rossburg, and Sloan soils are on flood plains. Loudonville soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock and are on similar positions."
