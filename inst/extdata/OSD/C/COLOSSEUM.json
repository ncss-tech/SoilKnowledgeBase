  "OVERVIEW": "The Colosseum series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Colosseum soils are on fan aprons and drainageways. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 150 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18.5 degrees C.",
