  "OVERVIEW": "The Cific series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to variegated shale. They formed in glacial drift underlain by weathered material derived dominantly from variegated shale. Cific soils are on strath terraces and hillslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",
