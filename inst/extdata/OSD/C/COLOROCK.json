  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 5 to 10 inches and depth to hardpan is 12 to 20 inches.\nMean annual temperature is 59 to 66 F.\nThese soils are usually dry for 6 months or more during most years, mainly during the spring and fall months.\nThe section from the top of the argillic horizon to the petrocalcic horizon averages gravelly or very gravelly, sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 15 to 20 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel.\nPebbles of the erosion pavement range from subangular to well rounded and from 1/8 to 4 inches in diameter. Very thin (1/4 to 2 inches thick) pinkish gray or light brown A1 horizons underlie the erosion pavement in some pedons in protected areas around the base of shrubs and the lee side of larger pebbles.\nThe B1t and B2t horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThey have weak or moderate and medium to coarse prismatic structure.  Weak grades of prismatic structure part to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or platy structure.\nThese horizons are usually clay loam, but include sandy clay loam, or loam.\nHorizons of secondary lime accumulations occur in the Btk3 or 3Ck horizon in some pedons. Secondary lime occurs as white or pinkish white, medium and coarse mottles or soft nodules, and has value of 8 dry and 7 moist. Pebbles in these horizons are lime-coated on all sides. Salt crystals are present in some pedons.\nAn unconformity can be present in the B3t and 3Ck horizons consisting of soil material containing 75 to 85 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bkm horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is 20 to 36 inches thick.\npH ranges from 8.2 to 8.8."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: these are the Bard, Casito, Cave, Crystal Springs, Goodsprings, Las Vegas, Mormon Mesa, Skyhaven, and Terino series. All of these soils lack argillic horizons except the Casito, Skyhaven, and Terino soils. Casito soils have 8 to 20 inch thick sola, and 7 to 16 inch thick B2t horizons resting on the petrocalcic horizon. Skyhaven soils have gravel-free profiles, strong structural grade in the B2t horizons and contain visible gypsum in the Clcacs horizons. Terino soils have 10 to 20 inch thick sola and are noncalcareous in the Al and upper B2t horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colorock soils are on smooth to gently convex, gently to moderately sloping broad alluvial fans at elevations of 1,300 to 3,000 feet. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 5 percent, but range up to 8 percent. The alluvial fans are dissected by a few shallow, and widely spread very deep intermittent stream channels. m ese soils formed in gravelly alluvium from mixed rock sources dominantly from limestone with some quartzite and sandstone. m e climate is hot and arid with a mean annual temperature of about 66 F., average January temperature about 45 F., July 89 F., and a mean annual precipitation of 4 to 6 inches."
