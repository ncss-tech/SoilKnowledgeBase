  "OVERVIEW": "The Caruso series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

Bridgeport, Grigston, and Roxbury soils occupy similar topographic positions as Caruso soils but are better drained.  Colby and Ulysses soils are on adjacent uplands.  The Gibbon, Lawet, and Silver Creek soils occupy similar topographic positions as Caruso soils along the Platte River.  The Gibbon soils are fine-silty.  Lawet soils are wetter and contain more free carbonates within 15 inches of the surface.  Silver Creek soils are in the fine family."
