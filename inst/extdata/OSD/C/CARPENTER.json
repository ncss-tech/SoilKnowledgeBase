  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 80 inches or more.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum, and from very strongly acid to medium acid in the lower part and the C horizon.  Sandstone, siltstone, shale, geodes, or chert fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in individual layers, but the weighted average in the control section ranges from about 10 to 25 percent.  Fragments are commonly of gravel, channer or flagstone size. The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  When present, the A horizon 1 to 3 inches thick has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges are like those of the Ap horizon.  When present, the E horizon 5 to 10 inches thick has color and texture ranges like those of the Ap horizon.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is s11t loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Some pedons have few to many silt coatings.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4\n6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.   Some pedons have few to many silt coatings in the upper part of horizon.  Few to many red, brown, or gray mottles in the lower part of he Bt horizon.\nWhen present, the 2BC or 2CB horizon is 5 to 15 inches thick with colors like the Bt horizons.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Bookwood and Oatlands soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Brecknock, Culleoka, Frondorf, Legore, Loudonville, Myersville, Penn, Ryder, and Westmoreland soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Caribel, Greencreek and Weedmark soils have annual precipitation of less than 32 inches.  Door soils have mollic epipedons.   Dormont soil lacks lithologic discontinuity, and mottles with chroma of 2 or less above 36 inches.  Duffield soils lack a lithologic discontinuity, and are formed in residuum of impure limestone.  Hayter soils have C horizons consisting of gravel or cobbles.  Morrison soils have sandy loam or loamy sand C horizons.  Neshaminy soils have diabase and quarzite coarse fragments.  Spriggs soils are formed in materials weathered from hornblende gneiss and hornblende schist.  Washington soils are formed in glacial drift, and have quartz, gneiss, and chert fragments in the upper sola, and weathered limestone fragments in the lower sola. Wheeling soils have fine sandy loam or gravelly loamy sand in the lower B horizons.  Williamsburg soils are formed in a loess mantle over glacial outwash and have sola more than 60 inches thick."
