  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Capillo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from interbedded shales, sandstone and limestone.  Capillo soils are on mountain, hill, terrace and mesa slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Rock outcrop is common where the landscapes are undulating.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 11,000 feet. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, the average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  Frost free period is 80 to 100 days. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer months."
