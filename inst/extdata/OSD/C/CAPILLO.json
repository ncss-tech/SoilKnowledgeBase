  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Capillo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from interbedded shales, sandstone and limestone.  Capillo soils are on mountain, hill, terrace and mesa sideslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
