  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Capillo soils formed in moderately fine textured interbedded shales, sandstone and limestone mountain hill, and mesa sideslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Rock outcrop is common where the landscapes are undulating.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 11,000 feet. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, the average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  Frost free period is 80 to 100 days. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer months."
