  "OVERVIEW": "Campone series are somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils occurring in convex, nearly level to strongly sloping narrow mountainous valleys.  Slope gradients are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 30 inches coming mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F.  The climate is cold continental.  These soils are usually saturated within a depth of 40 inches at least one month or more during most years, mainly during the spring runoff period.  The control section is stratified and contains strata of loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam, and gravel, cobbles or stones.  When the control section is mixed, the rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent and is predominantly loam containing more than 18 percent clay.  The soils are slightly to medium acid.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.\nThe Campone soils have dark grayish brown A1 horizons more than 16 inches thick.  The soils are slightly acid in the surface. The A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Dry value of 5 and moist value of 3 and chroma of 3 occur only in the lower part.  In some pedons, faint iron mottles occur in the lower part.  This horizon has weak to strong, very fine to medium, granular or subangular blocky structure.  The weaker structure occurs only in the lower part.\nThis soils has mottled light brownish gray medium acid C horizons.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has high chroma iron mottles in hue of 5YR through 10YR and chroma of 4 through 8."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Behanin, Blanca, Caballo, Croesus, Dateman, Hobacker, and Nevtah series.  Behanin soils have an A1 horizon.  Blanca soils have less than 18 percent clay in the texture control section.  Caballo soils are well drained, lack mottles, and are not saturated within a depth of 40 inches for any period.  Croesus, Dateman, and Nevtah soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hobacker soils are calcareous below a depth of 6 to 20 inches."

The soils formed in gravelly, cobbly or stony alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  The climate is cold continental.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 30 inches coming mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F, mean January temperature about 20 degrees F, and mean July temperature about 56 degrees F."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.  Drained phases are recognized where degradation of the creek channels has effectively lowered the water table to depths below 4 feet.  Normally the water table stands at depths ranging from 36 to 60 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used to provide grazing for livestock and wildlife.  The dominant vegetation is grasses, sedges, and forbs together with open stands of aspen or lodgepole pine.  Vegetation on drained areas is mainly balsamroot, meadow grasses, and sedges with some big sagebrush invading."
