  "OVERVIEW": "The Cymery series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff. Cymery soils are on backslopes of undulating plateaus and north-facing canyon sides. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
