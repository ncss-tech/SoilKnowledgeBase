Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,900 to 8,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Cajete soils are ashy-pumiceous, have mollic epipedons, and occur on north-facing backslopes of undulating plateaus.  Hoxoh soils are ashy-skeletal, have mollic epipedons, and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus.  Jemez soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and are on summits of undulating plateaus.  Tschicoma soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on footslopes and toeslopes of undulating plateaus."
