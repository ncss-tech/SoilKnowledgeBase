  "OVERVIEW": "The Chandler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Slopes are 2 to 95 percent. They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks high in mica content such as mica gneiss, mica schist, and pegmatite . Near the type location mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees, and mean annual precipitation is about 64 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches . Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 25 percent in the Bw horizon. Fragments are dominantly gravel in most pedons, but cobbles or stones are dominant in some pedons. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid. Flakes of mica range from few to many in the surface layer and are many in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 4. Where value is 3 or less, this horizon is less than 7 inches thick. Some pedons have A2 horizons that have slightly higher value and chroma than the A1 or Ap horizon. The A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of red, brown, or yellow. Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or similar in color to the Bw horizon. It is saprolite weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks high in mica content such as mica gneiss, mica schist, and pegmatite. . Texture is commonly loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or silt loam. In some pedons, the C horizon is sand, coarse sand, or coarse sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Manor and Micaville series are the only other known series in this family. The Brownwood, Cashiers, Fannin, Mt. Airy, and Watauga series are in closely related families. Manor soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder and formed from mica schist in the Northern Piedmont.  Micaville soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Brownwood soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cashiers soils have an A horizon with value of 3 or less that is 7 to 10 inches thick. Fannin and Watauga soils have argillic horizons. Mt. Airy soils formed from micaceous rocks in the Northern Piedmont and are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class."

Elevation ranges from about 1,400 to 4,800 feet. Chandler soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks that are high in mica content such as mica schist, mica gneiss, and pegmatite. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 40 to 80 inches, including 10 to 25 inches of snow per year."

Buladean, Chestnut, Edneyville, Tate, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils are in a mixed mineralogy family and contain less mica than the Chandler soils. Buladean, Brownwood, Cashiers, Chestnut, Edneyville, Fannin, Micaville, and Watauga soils are on the same landscape position as Chandler soils. Tate, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils are on benches, foot slopes, and fans."

Yellow poplar and northern red oak are common in the northern portions of  MLRA 130. The understory includes flowering dogwood, mountain-laurel, rhododendron and sourwood. Some small areas are in pasture, hayland, or cultivated crops. The major crops grown are corn, small grain, native ornamentals, Christmas trees, and truck crops."
