  "OVERVIEW": "The Caval series consist of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that form in deposits of sandstone. Caval soils are on undulating to rolling slopes of upland valleys and mesas. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
