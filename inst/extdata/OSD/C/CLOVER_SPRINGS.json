  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Clover Springs soils occur in drainageways, narrow parks and meadows on nearly level to rolling flood plains and low terraces in the ponderosa pine zone. The slope gradient is usually 1 to 2 percent, but ranges from 0 to 10 percent. The soils are forming in recent alluvium derived from limestone and calcareous sandstone with influence from basalt. Accumulations are usually 3 to 8 feet thick. The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. Clover Springs soils occur at elevations of 6,800 to 8,000 feet."
