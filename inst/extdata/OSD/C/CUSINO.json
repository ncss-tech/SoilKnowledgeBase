    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Volume of gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A, E, Bhs and Bs horizons and from 15 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons. Cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Stones range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe 0 horizon, where present, is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Reaction is ultra acid to extremely acid\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. Texture is loamy sand or sand. Reaction is ultra acid to extremely acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand, sand, or their gravelly analogs. Reaction is ultra acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2. Texture is loamy sand, sand, or their gravelly analogs. Massive, cemented bodies (ortstein) range from 0 to 20 percent of the exposed surface area of the Bhs horizon. Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, sand, or their gravelly analogs. Massive, cemented bodies (ortstein) range from 20 to 45 percent of the exposed surface area of the Bs horizon. Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6. The texture is sand, gravelly sand, or less commonly very gravelly sand. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is commonly stratified with individual subhorizons of sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand, or very gravelly sand. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."

The Adams soil is moist within 91 centimeters of the soil surface in August.  Kalkaska soils contain less than 10 percent coarse fragments throughout the series control section.  Garlic soils have 50 to 90 percent ortstein in the spodic horizon.  Liminga soils have more than 50 percent fine sand in the sand fraction throughout the series control section.  The Stutts, Duxbury and Pence soils have combined content of silt plus clay greater than 15 percent in the A, E, Bhs and Bs horizons."

These soils formed in sandy and gravelly outwash deposits. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 6 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 860 millimeters, and mean annual frost-free period ranges from 80 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 201 to 305 meters above sea level."
