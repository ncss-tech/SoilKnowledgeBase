  "OVERVIEW": "The Cherokeespring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt.  Cherokeespring soils are on benches on side slopes on basalt plateaus in Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, (711 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
