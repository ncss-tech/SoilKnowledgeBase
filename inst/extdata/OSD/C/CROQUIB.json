The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  Under native vegetation the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  Depth to the massive consolidated substratum is 25 to 40 inches.  The solum has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cubic centimeter.  The solum is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon is 5 to 9 inches thick.  It has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value is 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay by field estimate.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 moist, 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is strongly consolidated with 40 to 65 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam."
