The soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over loess and material weathered from basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 26 to 28 inches.  The frost free period is 60 to 85 days. The average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F."

Cramont soils are on hill summits, do not have a thick ash mantle, and have a clayey argillic horizon.  Seddow soils are on south- and west-facing slopes, do not have a thick ash mantle, and are deep to bedrock."
