  "OVERVIEW": "The Culdesac series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over loess and material weathered from basalt.  Culdesac soils are on hills on basalt plateaus and have slopes of 10 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
