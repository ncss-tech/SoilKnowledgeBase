  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Some pedons have a thin organic layer at the surface. The ochric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 36 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  Rock fragments are mainly well graded gravel, cobbles and flagstones and range from 25 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and 70 to 90 percent in the Bw horizon.  Some interstices are not filled with fines in the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from flaggy or very flaggy silt loam to gravelly or cobbly silt loam, and is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is extremely flaggy or extremely cobbly fine sandy loam or silt loam, and is slightly to moderately acid."

Elevations range from 8,500 to 10,000 feet.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from quartzite and sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The frost free season is 20 to 40 days."
