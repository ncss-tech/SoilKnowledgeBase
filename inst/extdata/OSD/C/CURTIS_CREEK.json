  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons ranges from 10 to 20 inches over the fractured sandstone.  The B2t horizon extends into cracks in the rocks of some pedons.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of about  20 inches  ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are moist 55 to 65 percent of the time but are dry 60 to 75 consecutive days in the 8 and 24  inch depth in the summer and early autumn.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has moderate fine to medium granular structure.  This horizon is medium acid to neutral.  The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or light clay loam containing about 18 to 28 percent clay.  It has weak to moderate, medium to coarse subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.  This horizon has few to common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

Agassiz and Hoskin soils have very cobbly loam argillic horizons with more than 35 percent cobbles and gravel.  Anatone soils lack argillic horizons.  Bearskin and Devils Dive soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the B2t horizon.  Elwood soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons."

They formed in residuum from sandstone.  The climate is moist with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches.  The frost free season is 80 to 100 days."
