  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick. The solum is 30 to 45 inches thick.  The particle size control section has from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Coarse fragments increase below the Bt horizon up to 80 percent.  The soils are commonly stratified.  Mottles occur between 20 and 40 inches.  Mottles are few fine to many coarse, prominent or distinct with color hues 7.5YR or 5YR, and chromas 4 to 8. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The soils are usually moist but they are dry for 90 cumulative days in some subhorizons of the soil moisture control section.  They are not continuously dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 60 consecutive days in 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak medium platy or fine granular structure in the surface 2 to 6 inches and weak fine granular or weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure below.  This horizon is hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic.  It is medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent materials coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has moderate or strong coarse or medium prismatic or moderate blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and has a noncalcareous matrix but contains lime veining in the lower part in some pedons\nThe C horizon has hue 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam to silty clay loam and contains lime veining in some pedons."

Bowbells, Flaxton, Hereford and Weed soils are calcareous within the particle-size control section and have continuous horizons of visible calcium carbonate accumulation.  Detra and Hesperus soils are moist more than one half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. and Detra soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Schauson soils do not have mottles."

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary parent rocks.  The mean annual temperature is less than 47 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches.  Freeze-free period is 60 to 90 days."
