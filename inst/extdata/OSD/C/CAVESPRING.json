Canutio, Emot and Ogral soils are moist in the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative in the summer. In addition, Emot soils have more than 50 percent silt in the fine earth fraction and Ogral soils have hues of 7.5YR or 5YR throughout. Forlorn soils are characterized by strong to moderate alkalinity in the control section and have a control section characterized by significant amounts of silica and lime coats on rock fragments. Spellacy soils have a moisture control section that is moist in some part more than half the time, cumulative, that the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F. Yermo soils have a MAST of 59 to 63 degrees F. In addition they have less than 25 percent rock fragments in the 2 to 75 mm fraction in the A and upper C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cavespring soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The soils formed in material from mixed alluvium. Elevations are 1,900 to 3,800 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections, are on similar landforms but are typically lower on the landscape. Blackmagic soils are on fan remnants and have an argillic horizon and a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Crackerjack, Crosgrain, and Fortirwin soils are shallow to a duripan and are on adjacent alluvial fans and ballenas. Granitepass soils are on alluvial fans and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Haleburu soils are on adjacent mountains and are very shallow to bedrock."
