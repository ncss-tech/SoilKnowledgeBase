  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Chilhowie series are moderately deep, well drained, and slowly permeable.  They formed in residuum from interbedded shale and limestone.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Content of limestone and shale fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the solum and from 25 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the solum and from neutral to moderately alkaline and strongly effervescent in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  High chroma mottles are present in some pedons.  It is clay or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bardley, Carbo, Endcav, Gatewood, and Oshkosh series in the same family.  Endcav and Oshkosh soils do not have hard bedrock within 40 inches.  Gatewood, Bardley, and Carbo soils have a thicker solum.  Bardley soils are also redder than 5YR in the Bt horizon.\nThe Bland, Dandridge, Eden, Edom, Opequon, Pisgah, and Talbott series are similar soils in related families.  Bland, Edom, Pisgah, and Talbott soils have a thicker solum than Chilhowie.  In addition, they have less than 60 percent clay content in the particle-size control section.  Dandridge soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section.  Eden soils average less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Opequon soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches.  Talbott soils have a thermic temperature regime."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chilhowie soils are nearly level to very steep upland soils in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 25 percent but range from 0 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in materials weathered from interbedded shale and limestone that is strongly effervescent.  The bedrock commonly is \"tipped\" or in a vertical position.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches."
