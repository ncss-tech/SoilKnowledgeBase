    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coldtree soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope and footslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff.   Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 9,500 to 11,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 33 to 38 degrees F., and the frost-free period is less than 60 days."
