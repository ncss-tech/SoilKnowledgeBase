This revision also changes the drainage class to somewhat excessively drained. This series was originally defined with a fluctuating water table at 42 to 72 inches. Recent work is indicating that a water table this shallow is uncommon. The conversion from surface to sprinkler irrigation may be contributing to this. Moreover, on the upper slopes of dunes with high relief, it seems unlikely saturation could persist at these depths. The 01/2011 revision provisionally retains the original water table criterion, but it is likely the central concept of this series will be revised to have no saturation within the series control section (150 cm).\nTaxonomy version: Eleventh Edition, 2010."
