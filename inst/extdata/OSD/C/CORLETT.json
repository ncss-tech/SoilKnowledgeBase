Kandaly soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage less than 15 percent and are slightly to moderately alkaline.

Some of the dunes have a salt crust on the surface. The soil formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the C1, the C2, and part of the C3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  From 0 to 8 inches  (A horizon)\nAlthough the C1 horizon has 5 percent carbonate, it is not recognized as a calcic horizon because it does not have evidence of secondary accumulations.\nThe 01/2011 revision updates the typical pedon description to match the description used as the typical pedon for the Alamosa Area published soil survey. This revision also changes the drainage class to somewhat excessively drained. This series was originally defined with a fluctuating water table at 42 to 72 inches. Recent work is indicating that a water table this shallow is uncommon. The conversion from surface to sprinkler irrigation may be contributing to this. Moreover, on the upper slopes of dunes with high relief, it seems unlikely saturation could persist at these depths. The 01/2011 revision provisionally retains the original water table criterion, but it is likely the central concept of this series will be revised to have no saturation within the series control section (150 cm).\nTaxonomy version: Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
