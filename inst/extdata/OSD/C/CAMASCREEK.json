  "OVERVIEW": "The Camascreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44F.",
