  "OVERVIEW": "The Comus series consists of very deep, well drained soils on floodplains.  They formed in alluvium high in mica.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Water worn rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and 0 to 40 percent in the 2C horizon including up to 10 percent cobbles but the weighted average for the particle-size control section is less than 35 percent.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4, with the lowest value and chroma confined to A1 horizons.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6 except some pedons have subhorizons with hue of 5YR.  The B horizon is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with average clay content of 10 to 18 percent.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Faint low-chroma mottling is at depths greater than 40 inches in some pedons.  The 2C horizon ranges from gravelly loamy sand to silty clay loam, with loamy sand or loamy fine sand restricted to depths greater than 40 inches and silty clay loam restricted to thin layers.  It is stratified."

Comus soils formed in recent alluvium containing moderate to large amounts of mica.  The climate is temperate and humid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

All of these soils except Manor contain more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Manor soils are micaceous.  In addition, Codorus and Delanco soils are moderately well drained.  Hatboro and Kinkora are poorly drained.  Chester, Elioak, Gaila, Glenelg, and Manor soils are on uplands.  Codorus and Hatboro soils are on floodplains.  Delanco, Elsinboro, and Kinkora soils are on terraces."
