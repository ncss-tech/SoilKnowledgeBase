  "OVERVIEW": "The  Cuyler Series consists of moderately deep and deep, well drained soils formed in till and colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. These soils are on glaciated uplands at elevations of 1750 to 2400 feet. Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent in the mineral surface, and 25 to 80 percent in the subsoil and substratum, with greater than 35 percent weighted average between a depth of 10 and 40 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone and siltstone with smaller amounts of shale. Unless limed, reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y and has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have a thin organic surface layer.\nThe BA horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue, value, and chroma similar to the Bw horizon. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak fine to coarse subangular blocky or platy or is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.

Knapp Creek soils are deep and very deep, and are formed in weathered residuum from sandstone conglomerate. Lagross soils are formed from water sorted material. Mandy soils are exclusively moderately deep, and are formed in weathered residuum from siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Macomber soils are exclusively moderately deep and are derived from phyllite and shale material. Rockrift consists of very deep soil formed in till and local colluvium."

They formed in till and colluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone, and some shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 58 inches, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 to 130 days.

The shallow, somewhat excessively and well drained Hawksnest and Halcott soils are closely associated on nearby convex landforms, and on slightly higher landforms. Very deep, moderately well drained Willdin soils, and somewhat poorly drained Ontusia soils are on nearby landscapes where the mantle of till is thicker over bedrock. Very deep, well drained Lewbath soils are on adjacent valley sides where the till deposits are thicker."
