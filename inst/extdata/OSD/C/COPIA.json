  "OVERVIEW": "The Copia series consists of very deep, excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and eolian sediments derived dominantly from mixed sources. Copia soils are on dunes, shrub-coppice dunes, basin floors, fan piedmonts, and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
