  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 48 to 100 inches. Typically these soils have less than 3 percent total sand in the solum, but sand content in the solum ranges up to 10 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A horizon, where present has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Where value is 3 thickness is 7 inches or less.  Texture is silt or silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt or silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The E part of the Bt/E horizon is vertically oriented and occurs as interfingers of albic material 2 to 20 mm. wide between prisms, and silt coatings on faces of prisms.  The E parts have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3, and make up 1 to 15 percent of the horizon.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the Bt parts, and silt or silt loam in the E parts.  The E parts typically become more clayey with depth and grade into vertically oriented streaks of low chroma B materials in the lower part of the solum.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Typically, about 20 to 30 percent of the peds in the horizon are firm and brittle.\nThe Bt' horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Typically, the horizon has vertical, iron depleted streaks of material with similar texture, but with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3, however these streaks are not present in all pedons.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Typically, about 20 to 30 percent of the peds in the horizon are firm and brittle.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown, range from few to many. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Duson series is in a closely related family but has a discontinuity to loamy and clayey Pleistocene age alluvium within a depth of 40 inches and does not have interfingerings of albic materials in the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coteau soils are on broad nearly level interfluves on convex, gently undulating areas and very gently sloping sideslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed under grass vegetation in loess deposits 4 to 20 feet thick.  The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 58 inches near the type location.  Thornthwaite P-E index is about 70."

They are poorly drained with aquic conditions in the upper part of the subsoil.  Kleinpeter soils are on higher interfluve positions and are well drained.  Patoutville soils are on lower, flatter positions.  They are poorly drained with aquic conditions in the upper part of the subsoil and have red or reddish iron accumulations in the subsoil.  Jeanerette soils are on lower, flat or concave positions.  They have aquic conditions in the upper part of the subsoil and have a mollic epipedon."
