The well drained Harvard, Martinsville, and Ockley soils are on similar landforms. In addition, Harvard soils form a biosequence with the Camden soils and have a dark colored surface layer. The well drained  St. Charles soils are on nearby landforms and have a thicker loess mantle. The poorly drained Sexton soils and the somewhat poorly drained Starks soils form a drainage sequence with Camden soils and are on lower lying areas."
