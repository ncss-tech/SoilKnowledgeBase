  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Catlow soils are on beach terraces and lake terraces. These soils formed in wave-modified alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. Pedons dominated by cobbles and stones are on beach terraces bordering old Pleistocene lake basins. Pedons dominated by gravel are on lake terraces within lake basins. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,680 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
