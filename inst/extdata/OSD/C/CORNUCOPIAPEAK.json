  "OVERVIEW": "The Cornucopiapeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and shoulder slopes of mountains. Cornucopiapeak soils formed in volcanic ash and loess mixed in colluvium or residuum from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean air annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
