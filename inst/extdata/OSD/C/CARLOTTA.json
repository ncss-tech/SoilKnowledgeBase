  "OVERVIEW": "The Carlotta series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Carlotta soils are on fluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
