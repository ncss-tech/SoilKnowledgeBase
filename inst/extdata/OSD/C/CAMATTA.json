  "OVERVIEW": "The Camatta series are very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvial material from calcareous sediments. Camatta soils are on high stream terraces and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 254 millimeters (10 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the indurated Bkm horizon (petrocalcic horizon) ranges from about 20 to 48 centimeters (8 to 19 inches). Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F). The soils receive moisture from about December 15 to about May 15; about 6 out of 10 years they are not moist in some part between the depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches) and the petrocalcic horizon for 90 consecutive days and are moist in some part for 90 to 100 cumulative days. The calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section is about 15 to 35 percent.  The electrical conductivity of the saturation extract at 25 degrees C. ranges from 1 to 1.5 dS/m (mmhos).\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2 or 6/3.\nThe Bkm horizon is 10YR 8/1, 8/3, 7/3. It is 13 to 51 centimeters (5 to 20 inches) thick. The uppermost 1 to 2.5 centimeters (1/2 to 1 inch) is a very dense laminate capping containing no pores. The Ckm horizon is stratified with thin laminae and strongly to weakly cemented materials, or alternating strata of the two.\nThe Bk horizon is a weakly cemented very fine sandy loam to loamy sand. It is 15 to 70 percent lime concretions and masses by volume. At least half of these concretions slake in water.  The colors are similar to the Ckm horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.  Soils in similiar families include the Bard, Cave, Crystal Springs, Domino, Las Vegas, Mormon Mesa, Pinal and Upton series.  Bard, Cave, Las Vegas and Upton soils have an aridic moisture regime that does not border on xeric. Bard and Las Vegas soils also have carbonatic mineralogy. Crystal Springs soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F) and have carbonatic mineralogy. Domino soils are 20 to 40 inches to the petrocalcid and are fine-loamy.  Mormon Mesa soils have a petrocalcic horizon thicker than 122 centimeters (four feet) and have carbonatic mineralogy. Pinal soils have an indurated duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Camatta soils are on high stream terraces at elevations of 427 to 518 meters (1,400 to 1,700 feet). They formed in old mixed calcareous alluvium derived from sedimentary, granitic and basic igneous rocks sources. Slopes are 5 to 30percent. The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 152 to 305 millimeters (6 to 12\nInches). The average January temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F), the average July temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F); the mean annual temperature is about 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F). The average frost-free season is about 175 to 225 days."

Callegus soils have a solum 31 to 51 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) thick underlain by weathered calcareous shale. Polonio soils are very deep, well drained calcareous clay loam soils on alluvial fans."
