  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuit series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of ash-influenced loess overlying glacial till.  Chuit soils are on mountain sideslopes influenced by glaciation.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The pedons have a bisequal sola.  The combined sola ranges from 14 to 28 inches thick.  The loess mantle ranges from 14 to 38 inches thick over the firm, glacial till substratum.  The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  The sola is churned and mixed by frost action.  Small pockets of ash occur in the sola of some pedons.  The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizons have more than 6 percent organic carbon.  Reaction throughout the profile is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 2 to 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  This horizon has been heavily frost churned in many pedons.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 3 to 8.  The buried B horizons are similar in color and texture.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 8.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon is massive, firm, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble."
