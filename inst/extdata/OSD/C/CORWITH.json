  "REVDATE": "01/2011",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Corwith series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in medium-textured sediments.  These soils are on uplands, glacial lake plains, and outwash areas.  Slopes are convex and range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
