  "OVERVIEW": "The Cogna series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  They are on low fan terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.   Combined thickness of the A and Bk horizons is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 63 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from June to October unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from December to April.  The particle size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay.  The predominant range is about 18 to 30 percent clay.  Fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  In areas that are in a lower physiographic position adjacent to rivers and sloughs, there is an overwash of fine sandy loam 12 to 20 inches thick.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Organic matter decreases regularly with depth and is greater than 1 percent at 20 inches.  Secondary lime occurs within 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  The organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 3/3, 3/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  Segregations of accumulated lime are in seams or soft masses.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same colors as the B horizon.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam."
