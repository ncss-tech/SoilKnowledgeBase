  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Colado series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Colado soils are on lake plains, alluvial flats and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
