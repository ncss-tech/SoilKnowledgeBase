  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time. The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from May or June until December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Except where artificially drained the soil is saturated to within 20 to 40 inches of the surface from about January until May in most years. In late summer the water table is 45 to 100 inches below the surface. Redoximorphic features are present in most subhorizons. The upper boundary of the redoximorphic features is within 20 to 40 inches of the surface. The profile is slightly or moderately alkaline in all parts. Carbonates are mostly disseminated and generally are present in all horizons. In some pedons the uppermost 4 to 8 inches and some sand or loamy sand strata below a depth of 40 inches are noncalcareous. The control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and has more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. A few individual horizons have up to 35 percent clay. Weak to strong stratification is present and organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Gypsum is absent in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is brown, grayish brown, pale brown, light brownish gray, dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown, dark gray or gray (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 6/2, 4/2, 3/2, 4/1, 5/1; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2). Organic matter averages 1 to 4 percent and is less than 1 percent below a depth of 20 inches. This horizon is hard or very hard and is massive in the upper part or in all parts. (See Remarks).\nThe B horizon is grayish brown, light brownish gray, brown, light gray, light yellowish brown, light olive brown, gray, light olive gray, pale olive, olive gray (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 7/2, 6/4, 5/4, 6/2; 5Y 7/2, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/2). Some pedons have contrasting textures below a depth of 40 inches while others have distinct buried A horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hueneme, Maria, Mocho, Merritt, Pacheco, and Sycamore series in other families. Hueneme soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Maria soils have mottles above a depth of 20 inches and have a dry value of 6 in the A horizon.  Mocho, Merritt and Pacheco soils have mollic epipedons and Mocho soils lack mottles and periods of saturation. Sycamore soils lack lime within 20 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Camarillo soils are nearly level and are on flood plains at elevations of 10 to 200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. They formed in alluvium derived mostly from sedimentary rock sources. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry somewhat foggy summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is about 54 degrees F.; average July temperature is 65 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 275 to 350 days."
