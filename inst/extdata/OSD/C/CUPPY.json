    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan is 20 to 38 inches and depth to bedrock is 21 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from mid March to late November (260 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid May to early November.  The soil moisture control section (7 to 20 inches) is dry in all parts from early July to early November (125 to 130 days) and is moist in all parts from mid November to early May. The particle size control section (10 inches to duripan) averages 35 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles on the soil surface, range from 15 to 25 percent.  Base saturation by Hach Kit ranges from 95 to 100 percent.  Vertical cracks 1/2 to 4 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of 23 to 29 inches when the soil is dry from early July to early November (125 days).  Few to common intersecting slickensides are in the lower part of the A horizon and upper part of the Bss horizon.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2, or 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 2/2, or 3/2.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and gravel, range from 15 to 25 percent in the upper part and 0 to 15 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles or gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Wedge shaped tilted aggregates occur in this horizon.\nThe Bw horizon color is 7.5YR 4/6 or 5/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments."
