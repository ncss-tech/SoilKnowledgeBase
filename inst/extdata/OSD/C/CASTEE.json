The soil moisture control section is dry 0.6 percent or more of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent above the 2Bk horizon and 20 to 50 percent below the 2Bk horizon.  The soil is effervescent at a depth of 0 to 7 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 8 to 15 inches.  It ranges 25 to 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, but the weighted average is 40 to 55 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent total clay with 12 to 18 percent as noncarbonate clay.  Depth to the 2Bk horizon ranges from 30 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6."
