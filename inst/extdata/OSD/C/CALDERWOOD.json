Elevations range from 1,295 to 1,865 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brace, Kerrfield, Old Camp, and Skedaddle soils. Brace soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to thin duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons. Kerrfield soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have firm horizons with a brittle manner of failure. Old Camp soils have argillic horizons. Skedaddle soils do not have cambic horizons."
