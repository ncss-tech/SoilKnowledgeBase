  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 16 to 38\ninches.  The soil is slightly to moderately saline and increases\nwith depth.  Exchangeable sodium is 3 to about 12 percent.\nThe A horizon ranges from gray to very dark grayish brown; hues\nare 10YR or 2.5Y, chromas 1 and 2, and values 3 through 5 to a\ndepth of 10 inches or more.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Soil salinity is less than 2 millimhos per centimeter.  It\nis slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B21t horizon is very dark gray or dark gray in hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, chromas 1 or less, and values 3 or 4.  It is clay loam,\nsandy clay loam, or sandy clay.  Clay content of the upper 20\ninches of the Bt horizon averages 25 to 35 percent.  Some pedons\nhave B21t horizons of sandy clay or clay loam with more than 35 percent clay that are less than 10 inches thick.  Prism tops are commonly slightly rounded and the upper surface is coated with a sandy film (skeletans).  Soil salinity increases with depth and ranges from 4 to about 16 millimhos per centimeter.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe B22t and B3 horizons range from dark gray to grayish brown;\nhues are 10YR or 2.5Y, and chromas are 1 through 3.  It is clay\nloam or sandy clay loam.  Salinity ranges from 4 to 16 millimhos\nper centimeter.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Few to\nabout 5 percent soft bodies and fine concretions of calcium\ncarbonate and a few gypsum crystals and other neutral salts occur mainly in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is gray to very pale brown loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. It contains few to about 3 percent soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate.  A few gypsum crystals and other neutral salts occur in most pedons."

Cuero, Czar, Smithville, and Racombes soils have less than 4 percent\nexchangeable sodium and have less than 4 millimhos salinity in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon and they have different native plant communities.

Slopes are\nmainly less than 1.0 percent.  The soil formed in clayey and loamy marine sediments.  The mean annual temperature is 71 degrees to 74 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 32\ninches and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 28 to 40."

Monteola soils are calcareous and have intersecting slickensides.  Imogene and Papalote soils lack mollic epipedons.\nIn addition, Papalote soils have mottled Bt horizons."
