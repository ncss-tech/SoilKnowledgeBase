  "BYREV": "Rev. DES-KTS-EMM",
  "REVDATE": "07/2012",
  "STATES": "CO,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowood series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slide deposits over residuum derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountains, escarpments, ridges, hills and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
