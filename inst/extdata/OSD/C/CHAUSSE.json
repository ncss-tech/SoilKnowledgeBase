  "OVERVIEW": "The Chausse series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium from limestone.  These soils are on hillslopes and mountainslopes.  Slopes are 20 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
