  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Intermittently moist throughout the year. Most of the moisture that falls on this soil is in the form of snow and is removed by wind and sublimation. These soils are dry in all parts more than half of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C.\nMean summer soil temperature - 5.5 to 7 degrees C.\nThickness of mollic epipedon - 25 to 40 cm.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages 50 to 85 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles. Lithology of fragments is quartzite.\nA horizon - Value: 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4 moist.\nConsistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry.\nOrganic matter: 1 to 2 percent.\nBkq horizon - Value 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nTexture: Loam or sandy loam. Lower subhorizons are gravel or cobbles in some pedons.\nClay content: 12 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 65 to 90 percent. Texture modifier is extremely cobbly.\nStructure: Weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky.\nConsistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry.\nConcentrations: Secondary calcium carbonate and silica masses less than 2 millimeters thick on the bottom of rock fragments, 1 to 3 percent (by volume) of the horizon.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cobblywheel soils are on mountains.\nThey typically are on backslope and shoulder positions.\nThese soils formed in colluvium and solifluction deposits derived from quartzite.\nSlope ranges from 15 to 75 percent.\nElevations range from 2,850 to 4,000 meters.\nThe climate is subhumid, continental with cold, snowy winters and cool, dry summers.\nThe mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, most of which comes in the form of snow. Most of the snow that falls on this soil is removed by wind or sublimation, making it much drier than the precipitation would indicate. This dry and cold climate inhibits plant growth.\nMean annual air temperature is 0 to 3 degrees C.\nThe frost-free period is 20 to 40 days."
