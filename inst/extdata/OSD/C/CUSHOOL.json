  "OVERVIEW": "The Cushool series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft sandstone.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum weathered from sandy shale and sandstone.  Cushool soils are on rock-controlled hills, pediments, structural benches, ridges, and short fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
