  "OVERVIEW": "The Courvash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  These soils are on ground moraines and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
