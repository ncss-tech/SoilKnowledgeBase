  "OVERVIEW": "The Crowshaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone. The Crowshaw soils are on alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in the 4 and 12 inch depth in more than  7 out of 10 years.\nThe mollic epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick.  Combined thickness of the A and B horizons is 22 to 35 inches. Base saturation ranges from 80 to 90 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist.  It contains 3 to 4.5 percent organic matter.  This horizon has weak to moderate fine to medium granular or weak medium subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid  to neutral and is 10 to 19 inches thick.\nThe Bw or Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3.5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly heavy loam with 20 to 35 percent gravel.  This horizon has moderate fine to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam with 20 to 65 percent gravel and a few scattered angular sandstone cobbles and stones, commonly below 30 inches."
