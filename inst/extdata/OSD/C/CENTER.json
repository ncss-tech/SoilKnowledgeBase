  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid except the C horizon and BC horizon, where present, ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The E horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 or value of 6 and chroma of 3. The A and E horizons are silt loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Mottles range from none to common in shades of gray and brown. It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Mottles of chroma 2 or less range from few to many within the upper 10 inches. The Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Mottles of higher chroma range from few to many. Structure of the Bt and Btg horizons are dominantly subangular blocky, but some pedons have weak prismatic structure parting to subangular blocky. They are silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon or BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. In some pedons where this horizon is in Roxana loess, it has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 or 6."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Askew is the only other series in the family. Similar soils in other families are Calhoun, Calloway, Dundee, Grenada and Routon. Askew soils have thinner sola and higher sand content in the lower part of the B and C horizons. The poorly drained Calhoun and Routon soils are dominantly gray. Calloway and Grenada soils are bisequal and have a fragipan and glossic horizon. Dundee soils have a chroma of 2 or less in the major part of the argillic horizon."

At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 40 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F."
