  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sand is more than 6.0 feet.  Content of silt plus clay ranges from 5 to 10 percent in the control section.  The sand consists of shell fragments, quartz grains, and volcanic subrounded fragments. Effervescence with dilute HCL varies from slight to violent.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon and moderately alkaline in the AC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is coarse sand or sand.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Generally, it is a mix of the A and C horizons.  Texture is coarse sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is coarse sand or sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catano soils are in beach areas along the coast.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in regolith of beach sand deposits consisting of sand-size shell fragments, quartz grains, and miscellaneous volcanic subrounded fragments.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 72 to 72 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F."

In addition, Aguadilla soils are acid.  The somewhat poorly drained Corcega and Coloso soils are farther inland along river floodplains and terraces, have more clay in the control sections, and have cambic horizons."
