  "OVERVIEW": "The Catano series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils found in beach areas along the coast.  They formed in regolith of beach sand deposits that consists of sand-size shell fragments, quartz grains, and miscellaneous volcanic subrounded fragments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 76 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sand is more than 6.0 feet.  Content of silt plus clay ranges from 5 to 10 percent in the control section.  The sand consists of shell fragments, quartz grains, and volcanic subrounded fragments. Effervescence with dilute HCL varies from slight to violent.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon and moderately alkaline in the AC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is coarse sand or sand.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Generally, it is a mix of the A and C horizons.  Texture is coarse sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is coarse sand or sand."

In addition, Aguadilla soils are acid.  The somewhat poorly drained Corcega and Coloso soils are farther inland along river floodplains and terraces, have more clay in the control sections, and have cambic horizons."
