  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 50 inches thick, and the solum is more than 40 inches thick.  Content of organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  Exchangeable sodium is normally less than 3 percent, but ranges to 14 percent in any subhorizon above 40 inches.  Content of salts more soluble than gypsum is normally less than .2 percent and is less than 4 percent in any horizon as thick as 6 inches.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  The control section is typically sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent, and sand from 52 to 82 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Content of coarse fragments is typically less than 5 percent and ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils have fluctuating water tables and are saturated at some season of the year and moist in some part of the moisture control section most of the time.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 74 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part typically has common medium distinct mottling, but mottles are large or predominant in some pedons.  This horizon is neutral to mildly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 7.4).  It usually has fine granular or crumb structure but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard.\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has large prominent mottles throughout, but in some pedons the mottling is common or distinct.  This horizon is neutral to mildly alkaline (pH 6.8 to pH 7.6).  Usually it is massive, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons."

Gannett soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick.  Poudre soils are calcareous at or near the surface, and developed in parent material containing much finely divided mica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on flood plains or low terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to about 5 percent.  The soils formed in noncalcareous, moderately coarse textured parent materials derived from a variety of rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches, but the soils are subject to restricted drainage and have fluctuating water tables.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 68 degrees F."
