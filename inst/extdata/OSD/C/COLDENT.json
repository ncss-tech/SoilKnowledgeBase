  "OVERVIEW": "The Coldent series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Coldent soils are on alluvial flats and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
