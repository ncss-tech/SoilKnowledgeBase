Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly alkaline.  The combined thickness of the A horizons ranges from 7 to 20 inches.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is typically fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam but loamy fine sand or fine sand is included in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous and have free carbonates.\nThe C2 and C3 horizons has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is typically loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand.  Some pedons include fine sand at depths below 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous and have strong effervescence."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canadian soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping low terraces or high flood plains of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). They are rarely flooded.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in material weathered from loamy sediments.  The climate is dry to moist subhumid.  The frost free days range from 200 to 230. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 40 inches. The elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet. Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Crisfield series of the same family and Dale, Lela, Lincoln, McLain, Miller, Port, Pulaski, Reinach, and Yahola series of similar families.  Crisfield, Dale, Lela, McLain, and Reinach soils are adjacent soils of the same terrace.  Dale and Port soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and they have more than 18 percent clay in their control sections.  Lela, McLain, and Miller soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections.  Lincoln, Miller, Port, Pulaski, and Yahola soils are in lower positions on flood plains.  Lincoln, Pulaski, and Yahola soils lack mollic epipedons.  In addition, Lincoln soils have sandy control sections.  Reinach soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, and have less than 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand in the control section."
