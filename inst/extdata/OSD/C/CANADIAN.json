  "OVERVIEW": "The Canadian series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on low terraces or high flood plains and are subject to rare flooding.  These soils occur mostly in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 31 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

Crisfield, Dale, Lela, McLain, and Reinach soils are adjacent soils of the same terrace.  Dale and Port soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and they have more than 18 percent clay in their control sections.  Lela, McLain, and Miller soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections.  Lincoln, Miller, Port, Pulaski, and Yahola soils are in lower positions on flood plains.  Lincoln, Pulaski, and Yahola soils lack mollic epipedons.  In addition, Lincoln soils have sandy control sections.  Reinach soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, and have less than 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand in the control section."
