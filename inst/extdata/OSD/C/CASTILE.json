  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 through 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 through 30 percent in the A horizon, 20 through 60 percent in the B horizon, and 35 through 70 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments are mainly gravel, but include up to 10 percent cobblestones and flagstones. Unless limed, the soil ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid through neutral in the C horizon. Depth to carbonates range from 5 to 10 feet.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from sandy loam through silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 or 6, and has redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from sandy loam through silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable through firm.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has texture, structure, and consistence similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loamy sand through loam or is stratified sand and gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Farnham series is the only series in the same family. Farnham soils have rock fragments dominated by shale.\nThe Alto, Braceville, Chenango, Ellington, Hoosic, Pompton, and Tunkhannock series are similar soils in related families. Alton, Chenango, Hoosic, and Tunkhannock soils lack redoximorphic depletions within a depth of 24 inches. Braceville soils have a fragipan. Ellington soils have coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Pompton soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Castile soils are nearly level to undulating soils on glacial outwash plains, valley trains and associated kames, eskers and water-deposited parts of moraines. Slope ranges from 0 through 15 percent. The soils formed in water-sorted gravelly and sandy material high in gray sandstone, shale and siltstone with lesser amounts of limestone and igneous erratics. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 45 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 through 50 degrees F.; and the mean annual frost-free season ranges from 120 through 180 days. Elevation ranges from 500 through 1600 feet above sea-level."
