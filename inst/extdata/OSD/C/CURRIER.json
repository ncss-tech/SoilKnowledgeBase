  "OVERVIEW": "The Currier series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from gneiss and granitic rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash. Currier soils are on mountain sides, toeslopes and broad ridges. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Eaglecap soils are 15 to 25 inches deep to contrasting loamy-skeletal material. Domerie soils are deep to bedrock and are dominated by channer size rock fragments. Esmeralda soils are dominated by rock fragments of diabase, gabbro, and serpentinized basalt origin and have a spodic horizon. Howson and Jimek soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Lemah soils have a spodic horizon and are dominated by rock fragments of Swauk sandstone origin. Nomlas soils are dominated by rock fragments of andesite origin and are 20 to 30 inches to contrasting loamy-skeletal material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Currier soils are on mountain side slopes, toeslopes, and broad ridges. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium from coarse grained metamorphic gneiss, intrusive granodiorites and quartz diorites, with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,800 to 6,000 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with cool moist summers and cool moderately wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 70 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 35 to 80 days. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to 170 days."

All depths to diagnostic horizons and features found in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nBased upon approval of an ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal contrasting class, the thickness range of the ashy mantle has been narrowed to 30 to 36 inches from 30 to 45 inches. Those soils with an ash mantle more than 36 inches thick meeting andic soil properties will be considered a taxadjunct to the series and an ashy-skeletal family.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
