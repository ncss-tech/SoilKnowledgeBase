The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following summer solstice. The upper 30 to 36 inches of the solum has 30 to 70 percent volcanic glass, 0.7 to 2.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 40 to 80 percent phosphate retention, 5 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture content, and 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc estimated bulk density.\nThe A1 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe A2 horizon has a chroma of 3 or 4 dry. It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam, extremely gravelly ashy loam, or extremely cobbly ashy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, a value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, or moist. It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Eaglecap series.  Series with similar classification are the Domerie (T), Douthit, Esmeralda, Howson (T), Jimek (T), Lemah (T) and Nomlas soils.  Eaglecap soils are 15 to 25 inches deep to contrasting loamy-skeletal material. Domerie soils are deep to bedrock and are dominated by channer size rock fragments. Esmeralda soils are dominated by rock fragments of diabase, gabbro, and serpentinized basalt origin and have a spodic horizon. Howson and Jimek soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Lemah soils have a spodic horizon and are dominated by rock fragments of Swauk sandstone origin. Nomlas soils are dominated by rock fragments of andesite origin and are 20 to 30 inches to contrasting loamy-skeletal material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Currier soils are on mountain side slopes, toeslopes, and broad ridges. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium from coarse grained metamorphic gneiss, intrusive granodiorites and quartz diorites, with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,800 to 6,000 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with cool moist summers and cool moderately wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 70 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 35 to 80 days. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to 170 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 36 inches (Bw horizon)\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 1 to 36 inches (A1, A2, and Bw horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 1 to 41 inches with 1 to 36 inches meeting ashy-skeletal and 36 to 41 inches meeting loamy-skeletal. All depths to diagnostic horizons and features found in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nBased upon approval of an ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal contrasting class, the thickness range of the ashy mantle has been narrowed to 30 to 36 inches from 30 to 45 inches. Those soils with an ash mantle more than 36 inches thick meeting andic soil properties will be considered a taxadjunct to the series and an ashy-skeletal family.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
