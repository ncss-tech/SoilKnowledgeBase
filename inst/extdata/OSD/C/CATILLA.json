    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to over 100 inches.  Coarse fragments, that are mainly siliceous pebbles, may occur in any horizon of some pedons and range up to about 10 percent by volume.\nThe A and E horizons are fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand and are slightly or medium acid.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  They are mottled in shades of red, yellow, and gray.  Redoximorphic features are few or common in the upper part and increase in abundance and size with increasing depth.  Texture is sandy clay loam except the upper 6 to 10 inches is sandy clay in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  The depth to the horizon containing soft rounded masses of iron enriched red plinthite is from 40 to 60 inches below the surface."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Desan, Padina, Matilo, Navasan, Patilo, Plains, and Tadina series (all Texas soils).  Similar soils are the Arenosa, Boy, Eufaula, Kuy, Landman, Silstid, and Silvern series.  Desan soils have redder argillic horizons and do not have redoximorphic features due to wetness in the argillic horizon.  Padina soils do not have large masses of iron enriched materials and have slightly cooler soil temperatures.  Matilo soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone between 60 and 80 inches of the surface.  Navasan soils have a water table in most years within 60 inches of the surface.  Patilo soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time.   Plains soils have mean annual soil temperature of 57 to 62 degrees F., and do not have plinthite in the solum.  Tadina soils do not have plinthite in the argillic horizon.  Arenosa soils do not have argillic horizons.  Boy and Landman soils are moist for longer periods of time and have udic moisture regimes.  Eufaula soils have argillic horizons that consist of lamella.  Kuy soils have warmer soil temperatures and have a udic moisture regime.  Silstid soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Silvern soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soil formed in thick sandy and loamy deposits mainly of Citronelle or Willis geology that have been reworked somewhat by wind.  The range in mean annual temperature is 70 degrees to 72 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 32 to 43 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 44 to 64."
