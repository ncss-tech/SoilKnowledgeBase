  "OVERVIEW": "The Carrico series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. They formed in mixed volcanic ash, loess and residuum from granite. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 80 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. The average annual precipitation is about 711 mm.",
