  "REVDATE": "01/2018",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Calallen series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine sediments in the Beaumont Formation of Late Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on flats on the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in).",
