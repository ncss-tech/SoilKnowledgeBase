  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cone soils occur on gently sloping to steep slopes under shrub-conifer vegetation.  They are underlain by gravel-size deposits of volcanic explosion debris.  Elevations range from 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is humid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 35 to 50 inches, with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F, average January temperature about 38 degrees F, and average July temperature about 70 degrees F."
