  "OVERVIEW": "The Cascadesprings series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over till from volcanic rocks. Cascadesprings soils are on ground moraines in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches (1651 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
