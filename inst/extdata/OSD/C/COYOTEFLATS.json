  "OVERVIEW": "The Coyoteflats series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils occur on fan remnants, stream terraces, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
