  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the fill materials ranges from 30 to 100 centimeters. The depth to a densic horizon (2Cd) is 50 centimeters or greater. The human transported fill may be any geologic deposit ranging from till, glacial outwash, alluvium, coastal plains sediments, or residuum, usually from a very local source. Rock fragments range up to 35 percent in the control section. The textures include sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Most pedons have up to 10 percent artifacts of broken glass, brick, plastic, or other human manufactured debris mixed in with the human transported materials. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the human transported material and from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the truncated soil in unlimed areas.\nThe ^A or ^Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. This horizon is defined by granular structure and by organic matter accumulation. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some recognizable pieces of other ^B horizons may be mixed in.\nThe ^Bw horizons, when present, have hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Structure is dominantly subangular blocky, and very fine or fine roots are generally common to many. Consistence is friable. Some recognizable pieces of other ^B or ^A horizons may be mixed in.\nSome pedons have ^BC horizons that are massive with plate-like divisions that inhibit roots from penetrating ped interiors, but allows roots to grow between the divisions. The other properties are similar to the ^Bw horizons.\nThe ^C or Cd horizons have hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable to firm, depending on the degree of compaction. Some pedons have ^Cd horizons that are root-limiting.\nThe 2Cd horizons have hue of 5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm to very firm. At least one layer is dense and root-limiting within 100 cm of the surface. Lithochromic mottles and highly weathered pieces of soft rock are common in the truncated soil. Some pedons contain 2C layers that are friable, but otherwise are similar to the 2Cd horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canarsie soils are on nearly level to steeply sloping artificially created or modified landforms in cut and fill areas. These soils formed in human transported soil material, with a natural subsoil or substratum that has been truncated and usually compacted by machinery. The cap of human transported soil material is relatively clean of refuse, with less than 10 percent artifacts of plastic, glass, bricks, concrete, and metal. The human transported soil material is dominantly from locally excavated materials such as alluvium, weathered till, glacial outwash, Tertiary-aged marine sediments, or coastal plains sediments. Rock fragments are derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, basalt, and quartzite. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1250 mm and mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 17 degrees C."

Centralpark soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Foresthills (T) have a dense layer from 100 to 200 centimeters. Greenbelt soils have more than 100 centimeters of human transported material. Greatkills soils have garbage in the control section. Ludlow and Wethersfield soils have less than 30 centimeters of human transported material on the surface."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium on vegetated slopes less than 8 percent, and high to very high on vegetated slopes 8 percent and greater. The runoff potential is one class higher where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil is moderately slow to moderately high due to compaction, but some pedons may range to high in the truncated natural subsoil. The substratum is dense till that occurs within 1 meter of the soil surface."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are generally covered with common weeds, raspberry, and mugwort if deposited in sunny locations; by turfgrass if part of a recreation area. Common reed occurs in some areas. Reed density decreases and the mugwort increases in areas with compacted surface layers. The more compacted areas support sparse populations of various grasses, annuals, and perennials that invade disturbed areas. Reclamation is difficult in smoothed, heavily compacted areas or where common reed density is high."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Canarsie soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition. This excludes them from the concept of Fluvents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 cm (^A and ^Bw horizon).\n2. A densic contact at 25 cm (Cd1 horizon).\n3. Calcareous reaction class - the  presence of carbonates identified by KSSL procedures in the 2.5 cm zone above 25 cm (Cd1 horizon) based on analysis from KSSL.\n4. Non-cambic - The ^Bw and ^BC horizons fail to meet the requirements of a cambic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Complete characterization data collected as pedon S95NY085013. Pedon analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
