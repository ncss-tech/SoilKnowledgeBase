  "OVERVIEW": "The Crockies series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum from basalt. Crockies soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
