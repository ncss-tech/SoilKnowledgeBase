  "OVERVIEW": "The Cooers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from baked hard sandstone (scoria) and shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
