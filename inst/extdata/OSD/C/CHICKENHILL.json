  "OVERVIEW": "The Chickenhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. These soils occur on hills. Slopes are 10 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 340 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
