  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum renges from 24 to 42 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizon varies from 20 to 35 inches.  Quartz grains in the profile range from few to common in the surface and upper B horizon and from common to many in the lower B and C horizons.  Reaction is strongly to extremely acid in the profile. Organic carbon content in the upper 6 inches of the argillic is 0.6 to 0.8 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay.  Structure is weak to moderately fine and medium granular or weak fine and medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky, and plastic.  Clay films range from few faint to common distinct.\nThe BC horizon ranges in texture from clay to clay loam.  Saprolite ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon is mainly saprolite of variegated colors.  Texture varies from clay loam to loam."

The Consumo, Corozal, Corozo, Ingenio, Jagueyes, Lirios, Maricao, Moca, Patillas and Rio Piedras series are similar soils in related families.  The Consumo, Maricao and Patillas soils have thinner argillic horizons.  The Corozal soils have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the B horizons.  The Corozo have coarser surface layer and lower exchange capacity.  The Ingenio soils are redder and have exchange capacity. The Jagueyes soils have coarser textured profiles.  The Lirios soils have coarser textured C horizons.  The Moca soils have horizons with shrink-swell behavior.  The Rio Piedras soils have the clay fraction dominated by kaolinite."

This soil formed in fine and moderately fine textured residuum weathered from volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid and tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 85 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 76 degrees F."
