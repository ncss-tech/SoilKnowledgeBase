  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cozdome series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in coarse-loamy alluvium over gravelly alluvium derived from igneous and/or metamorphic rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
