  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

Other grasses include little bluestem, Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem, Arizona cottontop, dropseeds, white tridens, hairy grama, little bluestem, slim tridens, buffalograss, Wright's threeawn, and curly mesquite. The woody plant is live oak. Forbs include bushsunflower, orange zexmenia, and gayfeather. With heavy stocking rates, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of lotebush, prickly pear, Texas persimmon, tasajillo, agarito, threeawns, red grama, Texas grama, hairy tridens, prairie coneflower, and broomweed."
