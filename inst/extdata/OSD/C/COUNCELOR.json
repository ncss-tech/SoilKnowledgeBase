  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Councelor soils are on stream terraces on valley floors, alluvial fans and fan remnants on valley sides, stabilized dunes, sand sheets, and low hills. They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevation is 5, 318 to 7,000 feet (1,621 to 1844 meters). Mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 13 inches, however in some areas it is as low as 8 or 9 inches, with the peak periods occurring from July through October. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to 2 inches. (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - Lack of diagnostic horizons. (C1, C2, C3, C4 horizons)\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (part of C2 and part of 2C3 horizons)\nThe type location of the Councelor series has been moved from Rio Arriba County to Sandoval County. Classification has been changed from coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, mesic Typic Torrifluvents. Present classification represents both soils in both counties.\nThe secondary carbonates described in the 2C3 horizon suggests accumulation of carbonates and hence a 2Bk horizon. This would imply movement of carbonates from the above horizons. This, along with the allowance of higher chromas in the C horizons than the A horizons, indicates that a cambic horizon may be typical in this series.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy 12th Edition, 2014.\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of SDJR - MLRA 35 - Mespun-Councelor-Mespun, limy substratum complex, 0 to 10 percent slopes, Sept 2014, LJG2\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
