Derallo soils are deep to paralithic contacts. Glassbutte soils are very deep. Jacksplace soils have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick and average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Roughridge soils are 127 to 200 cm deep to paralithic contacts.  Slockey soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabinspring soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on south and west-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyodacite. Slopes are 20 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,435 to 1,955 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
