  "OVERVIEW": "The Cayagua series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on foot slopes and side slopes.  They formed in regolith that weathered from coarse-textured platonic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.",

Candelero soils are on lower alluvial fan positions and have less clay in the subsoil.  Ingenio and Limones soils are on higher side slopes and hill top positions and have kaolinitic control sections.  In addition, Ingenio soils are well drained and are Ultisols while Limones soils are moderately well drained and are Oxisols.  The well to excessively drained Mayo soils are on lower foot slopes and alluvial fan positions below Cayagua soils and have less developed subsoils.  The well drained Pandura soils are on higher side slope positions and are shallow over plutonic bedrock."
