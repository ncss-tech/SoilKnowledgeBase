Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the A and Bt horizons, and from moderately acid to neutral in the BC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 and 4, chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray and brown range from few to many.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cayagua soils are on foot slopes and side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in regolith that consists of residuum which derived from coarse-textured plutonic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 90 inches.  The average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Candelero, Ingenio, Limones, Mayo, and Pandura series. Candelero soils are on lower alluvial fan positions and have less clay in the subsoil.  Ingenio and Limones soils are on higher side slopes and hill top positions and have kaolinitic control sections.  In addition, Ingenio soils are well drained and are Ultisols while Limones soils are moderately well drained and are Oxisols.  The well to excessively drained Mayo soils are on lower foot slopes and alluvial fan positions below Cayagua soils and have less developed subsoils.  The well drained Pandura soils are on higher side slope positions and are shallow over plutonic bedrock."
