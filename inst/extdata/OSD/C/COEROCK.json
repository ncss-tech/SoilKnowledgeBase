These soils formed in volcanic ash over argillite or quartzite bedrock. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters and moist springs. Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 33 to 36 degrees F. The frost-free period is less than 40 days."
