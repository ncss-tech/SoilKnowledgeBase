  "OVERVIEW": "The Coerock series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over argillite or quartzite bedrock. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops and in glaciated mountain basins. Slopes are 4 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
