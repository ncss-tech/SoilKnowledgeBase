  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 9 to 12 inches but ranges from 7 to 19 inches.  The series control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and contains much coarse silt and very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.   It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay or silty clay and averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and has a SAR of 5 to 25 in some part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline and moderately alkaline and has a SAR of 10 to 30.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon and it has colors and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam and is stratified with layers of very fine sandy loam to clay in some part.  Stratification is evident.  It typically has few to many accumulations of salts in some parts.  It ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Mudstone or siltstone are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

Blackpipe and Huggins soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Buffington soils have less salts and a low SAR.  Kube, Nunn, and Savo soils have an argillic horizon and have a low SAR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cactusflat soils are on nearly level to gently sloping concave foot slopes, terraces, uplands, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are long and smooth and range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in materials weathered from sodium rich sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches."

Blackpipe, Nunn, and Savo soils are on the high parts of the landscape. Absted and Weta soils have a natric horizon and are in slightly lower positions on the landscape.  Norrest soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are above the Cactusflat soils."
