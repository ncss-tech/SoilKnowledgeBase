  "OVERVIEW": "The Cranegulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in loamy alluvium and colluvium from fine pyroclastic and granitic sediments. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
