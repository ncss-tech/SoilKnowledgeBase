    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cranegulch soils are on all hillslope positions and on structural benches and landslide deposits at elevations of 2,700 to 4,100 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium and colluvium from fine pyroclastic and granitic sediments deposited as basin-margin subaqueous deltas. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."

Piercepark soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 30 inches thick, are fine-loamy, have an aridic bordering xeric soil moisture regime and occur on footslope and toeslope positions."
