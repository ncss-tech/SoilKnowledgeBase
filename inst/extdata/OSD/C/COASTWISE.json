  "OVERVIEW": "The Coastwise series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in schist from slope alluvium and residuum. Coastwise soils are on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
