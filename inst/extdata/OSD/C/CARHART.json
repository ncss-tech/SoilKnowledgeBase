  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic bedrock is 20 to 40 inches, (51 to 102 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 68 degrees F, (16 to 20 degrees C).  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 59 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is smectitic.  Reversible surface-initiated cracks 1 to 2 inches, (3 to 5 cm) wide extend to a depth of 20 inches, (51 cm) for 200 to 250 days when the soil is not irrigated.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have Bss and Crq horizons or gravelly substratums.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 10YR 4/1, 5/1 or 6/1.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/1, 4/2, 3/2, 10YR 3/2, 4/1 or 5YR 4/1.  Texture is clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 59 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Redoximorphic features are oxidized iron masses and iron-manganese masses.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bssg horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 10YR 5/2 or 6/1.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/1, 4/2, 10YR 4/1 or 5/1.  Texture is clay.

These soils formed in alluvium weathered from volcanic rocks with trace amounts of quartz and chert resistates overlaying volcanic sandstone or tuff.  Elevation is 140 to 760 feet, (43 to 232 m).  Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 35 inches, (610 to 889 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost free season is 250 to 260 days."
