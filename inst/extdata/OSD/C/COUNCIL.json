The particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 17 percent clay, 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser, and 40 percent or more silt as a weighted average.  Coarse fragments are mainly sandstone channers but some chert fragments are in some pedons.  Volume of sandstone channers and chert fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Where present, the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Typically, it is loam in the upper part and grades to silt loam in the lower part but in some pedons, it is loam or silt loam throughout and in some pedons it has subhorizons of sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with colors and textures like the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Typically, it is silt loam but in some pedons, it is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or has pockets or layers of these textures."

In addition, Alvin soils have banded E and Bt horizons in the lower part of the argillic; Elmdale, Hillsdale, and Oshtemo soils have coarse fragments which are of igneous origin and mixed lithology; Lamont soils typically have sandy banded 2E and Bt horizons in the lower part of the argillic; Mecan soils have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR in at least the upper half of the argillic; and Wyocena soils have sandy C horizons within 40 inches.  Boyer, Burnsville, Dryden, Lapeer, and Perrin soils have free carbonates within 40 inches. Eleva soils have a paralithic contact of sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

Eyota soils are in similar landscape positions where the dark colored surface is 24 or more inches thick.  Gale soils are in similar landscape positions where there is 24 to 39 inches of loess over siliceous sandstone.  Norden and Urne soils are in similar landscape positions where the loamy mantle is 24 to 40 inches thick over glauconitic sandstone bedrock.  La Farge soils are in similar landscape positions where there is 24 to 36 inches of loess over glauconitic sandstone.  Seaton soils are in similar landscape positions where there is a loess mantle more than 60 inches thick."
