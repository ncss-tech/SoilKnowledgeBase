    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock [commonly] ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly quartzite and sandstone gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon, but include up to 30 percent stones and boulders in the lower part of the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR , value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Textures are sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Cedarfalls series is the only member in the family. Related series in other families include the Rigley, Schaffenaker, and Vanderlip series. Rigley soils have an argillic horizon. Schaffenaker and Vanderlip soils are Psamments; and in addition, Schaffenaker soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Vanderlip soils contain thin lamellae."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cedarfalls soils formed in loamy and sandy colluvium on foot slopes at the base of sandstone outcrops or escarpments. The slope gradient ranges from 30 to 70 percent. The soils formed in recent colluvium\nmainly from sandstone with a minor amount of siltstone. Climate is humid and temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 51 to 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 41 inches. However, there is a microclimate within the gorges and canyons that is cooler and more moist than typical for the area.  Frost\nfree days range from 155 to 165 days per year.  Elevation  ranges from 950 to 1050 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dekalb, Lily, and Shelocta soils. Dekalb soils are loamy-skeletal and are on very steep back slopes. Lily and Shelocta soils are fine-loamy. However, Lily soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on summit positions; whereas, Shelocta soils are deep to interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale and are on back slopes, benches, and foot slopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is high to very high.  Permeability is rapid."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas of Cedarfalls series are wooded. Hemlock and aspen are predominant tree species because of the cooler and more moist microclimate."
