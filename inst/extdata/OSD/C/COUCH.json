    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Couch soils are on smooth old lake terraces, lake plains and basin floor remnants. They formed in alluvium derived mainly from basic volcanic and tuffaceous rock sources. Elevations are 1,310 to 1,615 meters (4,300 to 5,750 feet). Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 203 to 254 millimeters (8 to 10 inches). The mean annual temperature is about 7 to 9 degrees C. (45 to 49 degrees F). The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
