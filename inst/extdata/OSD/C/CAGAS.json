  "OVERVIEW": "The Cagas series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, and welded tuff. The Cagas soils are on mountains and mountain ridges. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
