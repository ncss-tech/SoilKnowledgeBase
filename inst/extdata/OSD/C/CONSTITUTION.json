Kapowsin soils formed in dense glacial till, have redoximorphic features within 100 cm, and are 50 to 100 cm deep to a pan cemented with aluminum, iron, and organic matter. Menzel soils formed in alluvium and are greater than 100 cm to a restrictive layer. Sadie soils have a densic contact at 65 to 100 cm and have redoximorphic features within 100 cm. Skipjack soils are greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, bedrock of metasedimentary lithology, and volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters with intermittent snow cover. The annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1,140 millimeters. The average annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."
