  "OVERVIEW": "The Constitution series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, metasedimentary bedrock, and volcanic ash. Constitution soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 1,015 millimeters and the average annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters with intermittent snow cover. The annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1,140 millimeters.
