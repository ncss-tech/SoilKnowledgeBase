  "OVERVIEW": "The Crystalcreek series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in a thin volcanic ash mantle over granitic alluvium.  These soils are on ridge sides and ridges.  Slopes are 20 to 55 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 47inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
