  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to the fragipan is 16 to 36 inches.  Depth to hard rock is more than 60 inches.  Pedons may contain 0 to 15 percent gravel throughout the solum.  Gravel is commonly quartz, granite, granite gneiss, or mica schist.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  A and Ap horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nE horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nBE horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  High chroma mottles are present in some pedons.  They are sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nBt and B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They contain mottles with chroma of 2 or less along with mottles of higher chroma.  They are sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam.\nThe Bx or Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They contain mottles with a hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is typically sandy loam or sandy clay loam with a large proportion of highly weathered, soft fragments of rock. The Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is highly weathered saprolite that crushes to sandy loam or sandy clay loam."

Belvoir, Bourne, Buchanan, Calverton, Cookport, Ernest, Glenvilla, Kedron, Raritan, and York series are in closely related families.  Bourne and York soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Belvoir, Buchanan, Calverton, Cookport, Ernest, Glenvilla, Kedron, and Raritan have mean annual soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colfax soils are on divides at the base of hills and sideslopes of Piedmont uplands.  Slopes are slightly convex or concave.  Gradients are typically between 0 and 4 percent but the range is from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils developed in material weathered from light colored granite or granite gneiss and similar materials.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 46 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 59 to 66 degrees F."
