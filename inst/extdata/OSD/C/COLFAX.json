  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Colfax series are very deep and somewhat poorly drained.  They are on uplands and formed in materials weathered from granitic rocks.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the fragipan.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  A and Ap horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nE horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nBE horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  High chroma mottles are present in some pedons.  They are sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nBt and B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They contain mottles with chroma of 2 or less along with mottles of higher chroma.
