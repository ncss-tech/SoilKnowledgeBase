  "OVERVIEW": "The Carioca series consists of deep moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed but predominately andesitic residuum and colluvium.  Carioca soils are on uplands and have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 36 degrees to 40 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.",
