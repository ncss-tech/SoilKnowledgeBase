  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. The particle-size control section averages from 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Redox accumulations are below the A horizon and extend into the argillic horizon. Redox depletions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Saturation occurs in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral; value is 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nCrossett soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR and value of 3 to 5. Texture is typically clay loam or silty clay loam, but individual subhorizons in some pedons are loam, silt loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a BC, Bk, or C horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above."

Peshtigo soils are more than 40 inches deep to carbonates. Slade soils are less than 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon. Ellwood soils do not have redox depletions."

The moderately well drained Ellwood soils are on slightly higher landscape positions than Crossett soils and form a drainage sequence with them. The well drained Menominee soils, the moderately well drained Morganlake soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Iosco soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick sandy mantle. The well drained Padus and Stambaugh soils, the moderately well drained Vanzile soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils are on nearby outwash areas."

These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 0.5 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period September to June in most years."
