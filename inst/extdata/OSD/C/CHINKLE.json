  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinkle series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and  colluvium from shale, siltstone and very fine grained sandstone.  The Chinkle soils are on hill slopes and summits.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

These lime coats and threads total less than 5 percent by volume of the horizon.  In some pedons this horizon lacks segregated threads or seams of soft lime.\nCr horizon - Hue: 2.5YR through 10YR.\nOther features:  This horizon contains 30 to 60 percent weathered bedrock material.  Occurrence of free lime ranges from few very thin to many thin coats along bedrock fractures."
