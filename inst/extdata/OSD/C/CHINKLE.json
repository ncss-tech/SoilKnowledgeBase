These lime coats and threads total less than 5 percent by volume of the horizon.  In some pedons this horizon lacks segregated threads or seams of soft lime.\nCr horizon - Hue: 2.5YR through 10YR.\nOther features:  This horizon contains 30 to 60 percent weathered bedrock material.  Occurrence of free lime ranges from few very thin to many thin coats along bedrock fractures."
