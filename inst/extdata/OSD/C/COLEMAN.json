  "OVERVIEW": "The Coleman series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Coleman soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches (560 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
