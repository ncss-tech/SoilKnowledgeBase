    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coupeville soils are in drainageways and valleys of glacial drift plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift overlying dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevation ranges from 0 to 90 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Annual precipitation ranges from 455 to 1,015 millimeters. Average annual temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."

Coupeville soils have a perched water table as high as 0 cm from October to April, 25 cm in May, and 60 cm in June, unless the soil is drained. Coupeville soils are subject to frequent ponding for very long durations from December to March and for brief durations during October, November, and April."

Wheat, oats, barley, alfalfa and vegetables for produce and for seed are common crops. Potential natural vegetation consists of Sitka spruce, red alder, lodgepole pine, clustered rose, salmonberry, trailing blackberry, red elderberry, common snowberry, stinging nettle, swordfern, slough sedge, field horsetail, and scouring-rush horsetail."

The previous classification was fine-loamy over clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Epiaquolls, which did not recognize the albic, argillic, nor densic horizons now described in the field. The previous pedon location was uncertain within a square mile.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon # 81P0672.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
