  "OVERVIEW": "The Coupeville series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift over dense glaciomarine deposits. Coupeville soils are in drainageways and valleys of glacial drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The previous classification was fine-loamy over clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Epiaquolls, which did not recognize the albic, argillic, nor densic horizons now described in the field. The previous pedon location was uncertain within a square mile."
