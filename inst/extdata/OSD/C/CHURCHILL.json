  "OVERVIEW": "The Churchill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Churchill soils are on basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
