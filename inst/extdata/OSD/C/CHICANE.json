The soils are usually moist,but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 65 consecutive days in late summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to SO degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 32 inches thick, depth to the clayey B2t horizon is 25 to 40 inches, and the solum is more than 48 inches thick. Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 26 to 35 inches. The albic and argillic horiznns contain iron-manganese concretions up to 2 mm. in diameter and larger ones are in the lower part of the B2t horizon. The albic horizon is silt loam, and has an abrupt textural boundary with the B2t horizon which contains 20 to 40 percent more clay.\nThe Ap horizon, or the mixed upper 7 inches, has value of 2 or less moist and 3 or less dry, and chroma of less than 2.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe upper part of the B2t horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. The lower part of the B2t horizon is silty clay or clay.\nCompeting Series: These are the Conley, Kooskia, Nez Perce, Shebang, and Tilma series. Conley soils have Al or Ap horizons 10 inches or less thick, thin A2 horizons which abruptly overlie a clay B2t horizon, are somewhat poorly drained and may have mottles in the A2 and B2 horizons.  Kooskia soils are medium to strongly acid and have a Bt horizon above the A2 horizon. Nez Perce soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than 20 inches thick, do not have a cambic horizon above the A2 horizon, and have secondary lime at depth to 20 to 28 inches. Shebang soils have manganese concretions larger than 2 mm. in the A2 horizon and a mollic epipedon that is 7 to 11 inches thick to the very hard massive A2 horizon. Tilma soils are medium or slightly acid in the Al and B2 horizons, have chroma of 2 in the Al horizon, have a mollic epipedon 16 to 20 inches thick and have mixed mineralogy.\nGeographic Setting: Chicane soils are on plateaus and have gradients of 2 to 40 percent. They formed in two or more sheets of loess. Elevation is 3000 to 4200 feet. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 to 26 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 110 to 135 days.\nGeographically Associated Soils:  These are the Fenn, Ferdinand, Cald and Uhlorn soils and the competing Nez Perce soils. Fenn soils have clayey Ap horizons, and wide cracks that extend to depths of more than 20 inches when dry. Ferdinand soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Cald soils are fine-silty, and lack argillic horizons. Uhlorn soils lack A2 horizons.\nDrainage and Permeability: Moderately well drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability.\nUse and Vegetation: The soils are cultivated. Winter wheat and winter peas are the principal crops. The soils are used also for hay and pasture. Vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, geranium lupine and camas.\nDistribution and Extent: Northern Idaho. Series is of small extent.\nSeries Established: Idaho County, Idaho, 1976.\nOSED scanned by NSSQA.  Last revised by state on 11/76.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
