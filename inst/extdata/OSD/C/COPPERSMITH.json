  "OVERVIEW": "The Coppersmith series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian material, beach deposits, alluvium derived from volcanic rocks, and volcanic ash. Coppersmith soils are on beach terraces. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
