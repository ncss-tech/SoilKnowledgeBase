The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 47 degrees F.  and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 59 degrees F. without an O horizon. these soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for less than 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 50 to 85 percent rock fragments of which 30 to 65 percent are cobbles and stones. The control section averages less than 10 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarse sand and very coarse sandy. The umbric epipedon is 20 inches or more thick.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist. Rock fragments average 30 to 70 percent of which 15 to 35 percent are cobbles and stones.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry."
