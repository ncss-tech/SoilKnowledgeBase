  "OVERVIEW": "The Calfranch series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Calfranch soils occur on broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."
