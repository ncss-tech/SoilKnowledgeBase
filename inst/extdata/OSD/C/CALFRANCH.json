  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calfranch soils occur on metastable broad ridgetops and slump benches, and on metastable to active side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 100 to 1,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."
