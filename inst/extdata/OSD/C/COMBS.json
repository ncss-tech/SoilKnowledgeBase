Coarse fragments are commonly lacking but range up to 15 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have sandy clay loam below a depth of 40 inches.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with color and texture ranges like that of the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown or gray.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons are stratified."

These soils formed in alluvium washed chiefly from soils of weathered sandstone, siltstone, and shale origin and in places limestone.  Average annual air temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 59 degrees F., and average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches."

Rowdy soils lack mollic epipedons and are on similar landscapes along smaller streams.  Gilpin and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons and are on nearby steep mountain sides."
