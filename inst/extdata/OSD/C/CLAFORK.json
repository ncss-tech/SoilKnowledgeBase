    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the top of the brittle layer is 30 to 40 inches. Depth to the gravelly 3Btgx or 4Bt horizon typically is 40 to 60 inches. In some pedons the 2Btx horizon may extend below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral. Some eroded pedons do not have an E horizon.\nThe Bt and Btg horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. They are silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Btgx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Brittleness ranges from 20 to 60 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Btgx horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 4Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is very gravelly and extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam or silty clay. It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have silty clay or clay horizons or their gravelly analogues on more sloping area."

These soils do not have brittle horizons in the middle part of the series control section. In addition, Armstrong soils have a stone line in the upper part of the sola, Malmo soils have free cartonates at 15 to 40 inches, Mystic soils have a mean annual temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F., and Sunbury soils have free carbonates at 45 to 60 inches and a mean annual temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F.."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clafork soils are on summits and backslopes of upland landforms and formed in loess and the underlying residuum from cherty limestone. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. As slope and erosion increases, the gravelly and clayey 4Bt horizons occur within 60 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crestmeade, Maplewood, and Cotton soils. The Crestmeade soils have a mollic epipedon and are on higher more stable summits. The Maplewood soils have gravelly subsoil layers at 20 to 40 inches and are on lower areas of the landform. Cotton soils have a lighter colored surface layer and are on lower more convex areas of the landform."
