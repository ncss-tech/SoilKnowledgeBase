  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carcity soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks including granite, basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 1158 to 1219 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., the mean January temperature is -1 to 0 degrees C, and the mean July temperature is 21 to 22 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Erber soils are sandy.  Stillwater soils are fine textured.  Swope are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Weishaupt soils are fine-loamy over clayey."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; smoderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the upper part and very high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the strongly contrasting lower part.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 5 feet (moderately deep to deep free water occurrence classes) between July and October.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than are present today.  Damming of the Carson River, diversion of water for irrigation, and local drainage improvements have effectively lowered the water table."
