  "OVERVIEW": "The Carcity series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Carcity soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., the mean January temperature is -1 to 0 degrees C, and the mean July temperature is 21 to 22 degrees C.

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 5 feet (moderately deep to deep free water occurrence classes) between July and October.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than are present today.  Damming of the Carson River, diversion of water for irrigation, and local drainage improvements have effectively lowered the water table."
