  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 80 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic matter decreases to less than 1 percent at depths of less than 20 inches and commonly between 10 and 15 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, but 3 moist and 5 dry above 10 inches and chroma of 2 thru 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam and averages 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has weak to moderate structure.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

These soils formed in a loess mantle with an appreciable component of volcanic ash overlying basalt.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  Mean summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F., and mean winter temperature is 31 to 33 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 165 days."
