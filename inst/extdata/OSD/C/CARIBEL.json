All of these series except the Greencreek and Weedmark soils receive more than 35 inches of precipitation mainly during the summer period, and also do not contain basalt pebbles in the control section.  The Greencreek soils contain less silt, and also contain 10 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles, mainly quartz.  The Weedmark soils are moderately deep or deep to a lithic contact."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 8 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 73 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Bt3 horizons).\nBased on more recent knowledge of the area of Caribel soils, the taxonomic class would be Vitrandic Glossoboralfs, assuming a udic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.  The udic regime is based on a predicted forest habitat type of grand fir/queencup beadlily.   Some evidence in the Kooskia report suggests a grand fir/mallow ninebark habitat type; if so, a xeric regime is predicted, and the taxonomic class would be Vitrandic Haploxeralfs.
