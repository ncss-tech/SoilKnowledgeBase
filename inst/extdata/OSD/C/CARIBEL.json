Greencreek soils contain less silt, and also contain 10 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles, mainly quartz.  The Weedmark soils are moderately deep or deep to a lithic contact."

The udic regime is based on a predicted forest habitat type of grand fir/queencup beadlily.   Some evidence in the Kooskia report suggests a grand fir/mallow ninebark habitat type; if so, a xeric regime is predicted, and the taxonomic class would be Vitrandic Haploxeralfs.
