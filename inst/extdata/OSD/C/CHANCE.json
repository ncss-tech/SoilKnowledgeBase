  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is estimated to range from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature from 66 degrees to 71 degrees F. The soil is saturated with water much or all of the year unless artificially drained. It is neutral or mildly alkaline. Strongly contrasting loose sand and gravel is at depths of 20 to 40 inches. The soil between depth of 10 inches and the sand and gravel is dominantly fine sand loam or sandy loam and average less than 18 percent, less than 50 percent is fine and coarser sand, and less than 15 percent gravel and coarser fragments. The organic matter content is moderately low or moderate and decreases regularly as depth increases to less than 0.35 percent at some depth of less than 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 0.5 to 1.5. If the A horizon is darker than value of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, it is less than one-third and thickness of the solum. Mottles in the A horizon range from faint to distinct.\nBelow the A horizon, 2.5Y hue is dominant, but in some pedons hue if 10YR, 5Y or is lacking (N). The B horizon is mottled, and chroma of the matrix ranges from 0.5 to 1.5."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Chance soils are in low areas, old channels, or swales on bottom lands and low terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent and range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium dominantly from granite, but they contain a small amount of material from basalt. The frost-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 13 inches, including 1.5 to 3 feet of snow."

Notus soils have sand and gravel at depths of less than 20 inches. Falk soils have chroma of 2 or 3, and they lack mottles at depths of less than 20 inches. Moulton soils have chroma of 2 or 3 and they lack mottles at depths of less than 8 inches."
