  "OVERVIEW": "The Chayson series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and loess derived from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces, benches, tablelands, plug domes and buttes. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
