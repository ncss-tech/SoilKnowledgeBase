The average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."

Budlewis, Merlin, Oshone, and Tanner soils have fine particle-size control sections.  Paynecreek soils are deep and very deep.  Vipont soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a Pachic mollic epipedon. Acord, Aninto, Bancy, Budlewis, Howcree, Oshone, and Tanner soils are on terraces.  Bancy, Budlewis, Oshone, and Tanner soils are generally on lower terraces.  Howcree soils are on higher terraces.  Chen, Hutchley, and Vipont soils are on mountainsides. Paynecreek soils are on dissected stream terraces."
