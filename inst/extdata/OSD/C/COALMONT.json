  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 7 to 30 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 36 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 36 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  ESP either remains constant or increases with increasing depth, ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but exceeding 15 percent in the Cca horizon in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and in the C horizon above the bedrock and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or light clay but averages 35 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It is typically clay loam or clay but clay ranges from 18 to 50 percent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline and has about 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coalmont soils are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges where bedrock occurs above a depth of 40 inches.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 20 percent.  The soil formed in medium to fine textured calcareous sediments weathered residually from sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F, and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
