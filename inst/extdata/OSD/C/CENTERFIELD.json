  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the very gravelly loam sand ranges from 20 to 29 inches. Coarse fragment content between depth of 10 and 20 inches ranges from none to 20 percent and textures are silty clay loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam. Below a depth of 25 inches, textures are very gravelly sand or loamy sand with 40 to 80 percent coarse fragment. Calcium carbonates equivalent between depths of 10 and 40 inches averages 40 to 60 percent including the lime in the coarse fragments of less than 20 millimeters size. Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth or remains above 0.35 percent to a depth of 50 inches. The soils are usually dry but are continually moist in some part of the 4- to 12-inch depth for more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. In 7 out of 10 Years they are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 70 to 85 days during the summer months and are continually moist 60 to 75 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 49 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to moderate platy, fine granular of moderate subangular blocky structure. This horizon is mildly to moderately alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is moderately to strongly alkaline."

All of these soils lack contrasting texture changes in the control section.  Newcastle and Sigurd soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the control section. Newcastle soils have less than 40 percent carbonates. Stillman soils have sandy texture and more than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the control section and have 2.5YR or 5YR hue."
