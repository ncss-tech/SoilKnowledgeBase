  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuniff series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone or in colluvium over the sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
