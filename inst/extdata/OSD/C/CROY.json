  "OVERVIEW": "The Croy series consists of moderately deep over a hardpan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lake sediments derived from a mixture of rocks.  Croy soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
