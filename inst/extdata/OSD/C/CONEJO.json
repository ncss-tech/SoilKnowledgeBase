The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May through October (about 140 to 160 days).  The particle-size control section has about 20 to 35 percent clay and some gravel is present.\nSome pedons have fine sandy loam or loam overwash less than 20 inches (51cm) thick.  These pedons have clay loam or loam Ab and upper Bw horizons, have 0 to 5 percent gravel and average 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  The extent of this overwash phase is 600 to 700 acres and is the result of hydraulic mine deposits splaying out of the early levees on Butte Creek, north of Durham.\nThe Ap and A horizons have dry colors of 10YR 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 2/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 7.5YR 3/2.  In some pedons, it has weak to strong granular structure; in others, all or part has moderate to strong subangular blocky structure.  Texture is clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1.5 to 6 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent gravel.

Segregated or secondary lime is in some pedons at depths greater than 48 inches, (76 cm).  Some pedons have redoximorphic features within 40 inches, (102 cm) of the surface, a few pedons have redoximorphic features within 30 inches, (76 cm) of the surface.  Some pedons have siltstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches, (102 to 152 cm)."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Conejo series was established in Siskiyou County in 1919.  The type location was moved to Butte County some time prior to 1989.  It is mapped in multiple MLRA's in Butte, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sutter and Yuba Counties.\nThe official description from Butte County was written prior to modern soil survey mapping and does not adequately represent conditions in Butte County.  The type location was revisited on 7/93 and the description revised.  The range of characteristics has been left as is.  The use of Conejo in other areas should be reviewed during MLRA updates.  In Butte County, to reflect actual conditions, the range of characteristics in the taxonomic unit description is narrowed down.  (Average clay in the particle-size control section is 27 to 35 percent).\nAdditional Data: Clay determined by particle-size analysis at local survey office."
