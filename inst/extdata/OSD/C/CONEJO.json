These pedons have clay loam or loam Ab and upper Bw horizons, have 0 to 5 percent gravel and average 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  The extent of this overwash phase is 600 to 700 acres and is the result of hydraulic mine deposits splaying out of the early levees on Butte Creek, north of Durham.\nThe Ap and A horizons have dry colors of 10YR 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 2/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 7.5YR 3/2.  In some pedons, it has weak to strong granular structure; in others, all or part has moderate to strong subangular blocky structure.  Texture is clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1.5 to 6 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent gravel.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe upper Bw horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4.

Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent gravel. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe lower Bw horizon has dry colors of 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3 or 5/4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent gravel.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline, but some pedons are slightly acid.  Segregated or secondary lime is in some pedons at depths greater than 48 inches, (76 cm).  Some pedons have redoximorphic features within 40 inches, (102 cm) of the surface, a few pedons have redoximorphic features within 30 inches, (76 cm) of the surface.  Some pedons have siltstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches, (102 to 152 cm)."

Gazos soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches, (102 cm) of the surface.  Carranza soils have extremely gravelly sandy clay loam C horizons within a depth of 40 inches, (102 cm).  Reward soils are effervescent and have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, (102 to 152 cm).  Salinas soils have secondary carbonate accumulations in the C horizons.  Westfan soils have Btk and Ck horizons that are strongly effervescent and have disseminated carbonates or concretions, have solum thickness of 25 to 60 inches, (64 to 152 cm), and have a water table between 36 to 60 inches, (91 to 152 cm) from November through April."

The soil formed in alluvium from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The climate has hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 26 inches, (356 to 660 mm).  Mean annual temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F, (15 to 18 degrees C), average January temperature varies from 45 to 50 degrees F, (7 to 10 degrees C), and average July temperature varies from 70 to 80 degrees F, (21 to 26 degrees C).

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Conejo series was established in Siskiyou County in 1919.  The type location was moved to Butte County some time prior to 1989.  It is mapped in multiple MLRA's in Butte, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sutter and Yuba Counties.\nThe official description from Butte County was written prior to modern soil survey mapping and does not adequately represent conditions in Butte County.  The type location was revisited on 7/93 and the description revised.  The range of characteristics has been left as is.  The use of Conejo in other areas should be reviewed during MLRA updates.  In Butte County, to reflect actual conditions, the range of characteristics in the taxonomic unit description is narrowed down.  (Average clay in the particle-size control section is 27 to 35 percent).\nAdditional Data: Clay determined by particle-size analysis at local survey office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
