    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Content of fragments range from 0 to 5 percent above 20 inches and 0 to 20 percent below 20 inches. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.  Some pedons are slightly acid just above the weathered shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe E or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8. Below depths of 10 inches from its upper boundary there are few to many redox depletions of 2 or lower chroma, and most pedons have few to many red, yellowish red and brown redox accumulations below that depth Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon."

Carbonton and Brickhaven(T) soils formed in residuum of the Triassic Basin of the Southern Piedmont. Carbonton soils are somewhat poorly drained. Brickhaven(T) soils are deep to bedrock."

Holston and Leesburg soils are fine loamy and are on ancient, high river terraces.  Mimosa soils are deep to phosphatic limestone bedrock."

Idle or brushy areas are common.  Woodland consists chiefly of oak, hickory, sweetgum, elm, dogwood, and Virginia and loblolly pines."
