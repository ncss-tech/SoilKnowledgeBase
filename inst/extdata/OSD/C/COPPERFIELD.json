The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches but may range between 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  The reaction in the subsoil is slightly acid to neutral.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the 2Bt horizon (argillic) is 40 to 50 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 40 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam to clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 20 to 35 percent gravel, 15 to 40 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 35 to 55 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon, when present, has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Copperfield soils are on steep, meta-stable and active north-facing side slopes of low elevation hills and canyon walls.   Elevations are 800 to 3,400 feet.  Slope is 30 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from basalt.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 145 days."
