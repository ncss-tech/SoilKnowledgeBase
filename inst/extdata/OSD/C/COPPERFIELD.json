  "OVERVIEW": "The Copperfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils on side slopes of hills and canyon walls.  They formed in colluvium derived dominantly from basalt.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches  and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
