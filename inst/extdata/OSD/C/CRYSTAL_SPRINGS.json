These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite with small amounts of quartzite, sandstone, ignimbrite, or schist.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,169 to 1,879 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
