  "OVERVIEW": "The Cocoa series consists of moderately deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils on upland coastal ridges.  They formed in sandy marine or eolian sediments deposited over coquina limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Sand grains are commonly coated with iron oxides.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Sand grains are coated with iron oxides.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand, but ranges to sand having more than 3 percent increase in clay content than the overlying horizon."

The excessively drained Astatula and St. Lucie soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Canaveral soils are on slightly lower positions, are sandy throughout and contain shell fragments.  Orsino and Paola soils have horizons with very weakly expressed spodic horizons and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Orsino soils are moderately well drained and on slightly lower positions while Paola soils are excessively drained and on higher positions. The well to excessively drained Palm Beach soils are on similar positions, are sandy throughout, and have fragments of shell throughout.  The very poorly or poorly drained Parkwood soils are on lower positions, have mollic epipedons, have a coarse-loamy control section, and have secondary carbonates in the subsoil.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on slightly lower positions and have a spodic horizon."
