Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Sand grains are commonly coated with iron oxides.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Sand grains are coated with iron oxides.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand, but ranges to sand having more than 3 percent increase in clay content than the overlying horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cocoa soils are on upland ridges near the Atlantic coast.  Slopes range from about 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in thin regolith of sandy marine or eolian sandy sediments over coquina limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 76 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Astatula, Canaveral, Orsino, Palm Beach, Paola, Parkwood, Pomello, and St. Lucie series, all of which are very deep.  The excessively drained Astatula and St. Lucie soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Canaveral soils are on slightly lower positions, are sandy throughout and contain shell fragments.  Orsino and Paola soils have horizons with very weakly expressed spodic horizons and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Orsino soils are moderately well drained and on slightly lower positions while Paola soils are excessively drained and on higher positions. The well to excessively drained Palm Beach soils are on similar positions, are sandy throughout, and have fragments of shell throughout.  The very poorly or poorly drained Parkwood soils are on lower positions, have mollic epipedons, have a coarse-loamy control section, and have secondary carbonates in the subsoil.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on slightly lower positions and have a spodic horizon."
