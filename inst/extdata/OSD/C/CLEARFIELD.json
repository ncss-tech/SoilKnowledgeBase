Available laboratory data indicate that most pedons do not meet the clay increase requirements for an argillic horizon.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is marginal to the fine-silty family.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
