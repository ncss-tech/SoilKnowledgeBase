  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clearfield series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of Wisconsin Age loess underlain by a gleyed Yarmouth-Sangamon paleosol.  These soils are on linear to slightly convex side slopes and head slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 5 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.",

Available laboratory data indicate that most pedons do not meet the clay increase requirements for an argillic horizon.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is marginal to the fine-silty family.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014."
