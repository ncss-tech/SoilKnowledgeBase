Revised from Ochraquults to Albaquults. The classification of these soils as \"aquults\" is based on evidence of wetness other than low chroma. Low chroma mottles and gray matrix colors which are normal in other poorly drained soils are rare in these soils. For this reason the depth to, extent, and distinctness of redoximorphic features (mainly masses of oxidized iron and nodules), landscape position, and hydrologic indicators, have been used so as to group these soils with soils of similar drainage.\n02/2002. This pedon description was revised in order to more clearly reflect typical colors, glauconite content, and other horizonation features found in this series. Revisions were also made to the range in characteristics needed for MLRA update projects in NJ, MD, and DE. MLRA survey update observations and review of previously published soil survey data on these soils indicates that in some mapped areas Colemantown soils have umbric epipedons. However, because the majority of these soils exhibit an abrupt textural change between the umbric epipedon and the argillic horizon, within a short vertical distance (7.5 cm), they do not meet the criteria for classification of \"Umbraquults\". Colemantown soils with umbric epipedons do not differ significantly in use and management from those with ochric epipedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 86 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has periodic saturation and reduction within 0 to 30 cm of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 200 cm of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)\nAbrupt textural change: A significant increase in clay content in the fine-earth fraction within a vertical distance of 7.5 cm or less from the base of the ochric epipedon and the upper part of the argillic horizon (the zone between 25 and 32.5 cm)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nHigh glauconite content feature--weighted average of 20 percent or more glauconite pellets, by weight in the fine-earth fraction within the Bt mineralogy control section (25 to 75 cm zone)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon 92NJ-033-007.
