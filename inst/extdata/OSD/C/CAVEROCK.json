  "OVERVIEW": "The Caverock series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from latite.  The Caverock soils are on side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 686 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
