  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crawford series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments that are underlain by indurated limestone bedrock. These soils are on broad nearly level or gently sloping uplands and slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about degrees 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in).",
