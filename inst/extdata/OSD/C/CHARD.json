  "OVERVIEW": "The Chard series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and glaciofluvial or lacustrine deposits. Chard soils are on terraces and their side slopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 49 to 55 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 90 to 105 days. Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 20 to 44 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. The upper part of the particle- size control section is silt loam or very fine sandy loam grading to sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the lower part, and contains less than 5 percent coarse fragments. Depth to the 3C horizon is more than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 when dry. Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. It has weak structure or is massive.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. It has weak prismatic or blocky structure. Soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw & 2Bk horizons have value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam. They are massive or single grained. The lower part of these horizons have accumulation of secondary lime. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 12 percent. Soil reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon, when present, is coarse sand, sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy and contains lenses of fine gravel in some pedons."

Bolicker soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle- size control section. Disautel soils have 20 to 50 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Dufur soils are 30 to 50 inches to secondary lime and are medium textured throughout the particle-size control section. Kidman soils are are dry for 60 to 70 consecutive days and lack a discontinuity to sands."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed from a mixture of loess and glaciofluvial or lacustrine material. The summers are hot and dry and the winters are cool and moist. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. Mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The frost- free season is 135 to 190 days."

Alpowa soils are loamy-skeletal. Anders, Lickskillet, and Nims soils have a lithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches. Bagdad, Nansene, Oliphant, and Walla Walla soils are coarse-silty. Benge soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Spofford soils have natric horizons."

Common irrigated crops are small grains, hay, pasture, and orchards. Winter wheat in a summer fallow system is grown dryland. Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, lupine, big sagebrush, and rabbitbrush."
