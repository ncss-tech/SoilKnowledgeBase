  "OVERVIEW": "The Chita series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial sediments derived from igneous rocks and sandstone. Chita soils are on mesas and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
