  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowtrack series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over buried loamy soils from volcanic bedrock.  Cowtrack soils are on hills and mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degreesC.",

The soil is usually dry in all parts from late May to mid-November, and is usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. from April 15 to December 1, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 30 to November 15.  Summer thunderstorms occur, but are sporadic and usually do not wet the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C.  Mean summer soil temperatures are 15 to 17.8 degrees C.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent.  Ash content is 60 to 100 percent in the ashy over-burden.  Dry bulk density of the ashy overburden is 1.1 to 1.25 g/cc.  The moist bulk density is 1.30 to 1.45 g/cc.  The soil surface is partially covered with 5 to 15 percent pumice gravel.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral. Aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 7/1, and moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/1.  The soil contains 0 to 5 percent fine pumice gravel.  The organic carbon content is 0.45 to 0.55 percent.\nThe C horizon colors and texture are similar to the A horizon.\nThe buried B horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4 or 2.5Y 6/2, and moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Textures are sandy loam or loam.  Rock fragment content is 3 to 15 percent consisting of 0 to 10 percent gravel and 1 to 5 percent cobbles and stones."
