  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of sandy material exceeds 80 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid through slightly acid unless limed.  Quartz gravel make up 0 to 30 percent of the soil above a depth of 40 inches and 0 to 70 percent below a depth of 40 inches.  Lamellae are above a depth of 60 inches and have a total thickness of less than 6 inches.  They commonly are 1/8 to 1 inch thick and are discontinuous.  They have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The lamellae are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Where value is 2 or 3 it is less than 10 inches thick.  The A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons do not have a Bw horizon.\nThe E horizon and the E part of the E and Bt horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has matrix hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8, chroma of 1 through 4.  It commonly is stratified coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Duffem and Hainesville are the only series in the same family; however Alpin soils also have lammelae and are assumed to be in the same family.  Alaga, Arenosa, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Conetoe, Foxworth, Kenansville, Lakeland, and Molena are similar series in other families. Alpin and Duffern soils do not have a water table within 6 feet.  Hainesville soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 days in most years.  Alaga, Arenosa, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Foxworth, and Lakeland soils do not have lamellae.  Conetoe, Kenansville, and Molena soils have argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catpoint soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces along major streams in the Coastal Plain and on low Coastal Plain surfaces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in sandy fluvial and marine sediments, usually at elevations below 50 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches.  Elevation at the site location is about 15 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Conetoe and Kenansville soils, these are the Augusta, Bojac, Nansemond, Ogeechee, Pactolus, Rumford, State, and Tetotum soils.  All of these soils have an argillic horizon except Pactolus.  Pactolus soils have Fe depletions above 40 inches.  Nansemond and Tetotum soils have Fe depletions within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.  Augusta and Ogeechee soils are more poorly drained and commonly are on slightly lower landscape positions.  Bojac, Nansemond, and Rumford soils are coarse-loamy.  Augusta, Ogeechee, State, and Tetotum soils are fine-loamy."

The presence of lamellae, siliceous mineralogy, and the seasonal high water table distinguish it from the Tarboro series.\n2. Classification  was changed with this revision of the series.  The series was previously classified as siliceous, thermic Typic Udipsamments.\n3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.
