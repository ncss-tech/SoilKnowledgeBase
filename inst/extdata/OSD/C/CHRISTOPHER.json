  "OVERVIEW": "The Christopher series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash derived from granodiorite. The Christopher soils are on glacial outwash terraces in the tahoe basin. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
