  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Celina soils are on till plains and moraines of Late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying loamy till of high-lime content. The till typically contains less than 24 percent clay and has calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 25 to 45 percent. Rock fragments are primarily limestone but includes acid shale, sandstone, and igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1067 mm (33 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Mean summer air temperature ranges from 23 to 24 degrees C (73 to 75 degrees F)."

The poorly drained Brookston soils and very poorly drained Kokomo soils are in drainageways. The moderately well drained Corwin soils have a dark surface and are on adjoining landscapes. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils are on lower positions of the landscape. In addition, Fincastle soils have more than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess. Miamian soils are well drained and are on higher landscape positions. Milton soils are well drained and are on areas where bedrock is less than 102 cm (40 inches). Odell and Randolph soils are somewhat poorly drained and on lower positions of the landscape. In addition, Randolph soils are on areas where bedrock is less than 102 cm (40 inches). The moderately well drained Xenia soils have more than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and are on adjacent landscapes."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 1.0 to 2.5 feet between February and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the dense till and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately slow above the dense till, and very slow in the dense till."

The particle-size classification needs to be re-evaluated during MLRA updating activities and a new type location established.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 74 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 2BCt horizons).\nDensic contact: at 74 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 43 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
