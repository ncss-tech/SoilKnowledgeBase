  "OVERVIEW": "The Calabasas series consists of well drained soils that are deep to duripan.  Calabasas soils formed in eolian material derived from loess, volcanic ash, and pumice; and alluvium derived from loess and basalt.  They are on summits of mesas and erosional fan remnants.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 4 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 4 to about 25 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 32 to about 49 inches. (Bkq horizon)\nDuripan: The zone from 49 to about 54 inches and from 70 to about 81 inches. (Bkqm and B'kqm horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: The zone from 49 to about 54 inches. (Bkqm horizon)\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the coarse silt or very fine sand fractions within 75 cm of the soil surface.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  Calabasas soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nThe 11/2006 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon used in the update soil survey of the Santa Fe Area. The series concept was also changed from a very deep soil with a cambic horizon to one with a duripan at 40 to 60 inches and an argillic horizon. The classification of Calabasas when established was fine-silty, mixed, mesic Ustollic Camborthids. The soil at the new type location was provisionally proposed as the Cuerbio series in 1996 before being dropped and correlated with Calabasas in 2006."
