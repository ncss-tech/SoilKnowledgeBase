    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calabasas soils are on summits of mesas and erosional fan remnants.  They formed in eolian material derived from Quaternary loess, volcanic ash, and pumice and alluvium derived from loess and Tertiary basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 4 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 4 to about 25 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 32 to about 49 inches. (Bkq horizon)\nDuripan: The zone from 49 to about 54 inches and from 70 to about 81 inches. (Bkqm and B'kqm horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: The zone from 49 to about 54 inches. (Bkqm horizon)\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the coarse silt or very fine sand fractions within 75 cm of the soil surface.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  Calabasas soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nThe 11/2006 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon used in the update soil survey of the Santa Fe Area. The series concept was also changed from a very deep soil with a cambic horizon to one with a duripan at 40 to 60 inches and an argillic horizon. The classification of Calabasas when established was fine-silty, mixed, mesic Ustollic Camborthids. The soil at the new type location was provisionally proposed as the Cuerbio series in 1996 before being dropped and correlated with Calabasas in 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The type location has been sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92NM-049-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
