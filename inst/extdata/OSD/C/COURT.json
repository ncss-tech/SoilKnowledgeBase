The soils are dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Organic matter decreases to less than 1 percent at depths of less than 20 inches. Depth to very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand and depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 40 inches.  The A and AB horizons have phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 15 to 30 percent glass, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent and is asy sandy loam or ashy fine sandy loam.  The upper part of the particle-size control sectin has 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has 0 to 20 percent pebbles, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak platy or granular to weak subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It has weak to moderate subangular blocky structure.  It has 5 to 20 percent pebbles and cobbles.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It has 55 to 65 percent pebbles and 10 to 15 percent cobbles.  It has 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate and 5 to 10 percent clay."

Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean summer temperature is 61 degrees to 64 degrees F., the mean winter temperature is 32 degrees to 36 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.

Lamonta, McCoin, and Simas soils are upland soils.  Lamonta soils have duripans and are fine textured. McCoin soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Simas soils have fine textured argillic horizons.  Courtrock soils lack the vitrandic properties in the upper part of the profile."
