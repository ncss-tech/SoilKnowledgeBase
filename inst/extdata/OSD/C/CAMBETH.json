  "OVERVIEW": "The Cambeth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
