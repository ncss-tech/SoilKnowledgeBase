    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Campton soils are on loess covered outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains of Wisconsinan age. They formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1,140 mm (30 to 45 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Drummer, Kaneville, Kendall, Martinsville and Virgil soils. The poorly drained Drummer soils are in slight depressions or on low-lying parts of the landform below the Campton soils. The moderately well drained Kaneville soils have a dark colored surface layer and are on nearby similar landforms. The well drained Martinsville soils are on slightly higher landform positions where the loess cap is thinner. The somewhat poorly drained Kendall and Virgil soils are on slightly lower lying landform positions."

An intermittent apparent water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loess and moderate or moderately rapid in the outwash."
