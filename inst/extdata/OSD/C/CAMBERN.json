  "OVERVIEW": "The Cambern series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep to tuff and ash.  Cambern soils formed in ash and tuff, with some influence from basalt and cinders on mountain side slopes and mountain tops.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Bowbells, Carfall, Center Creek, Fiesta, Flaxton, Hereford, Hesperus, Jaythree, Laceycreek, Ohwiler, Pachel, Schauson, Shermap, Todacheene, Tschicoma and Weed soils are very deep. Detra soils have a lithic contact of limestone between 40 and 60 inches deep. Chugcreek soils have a lithic contact of granite at moderate depths. Gordo soils have a paralithic contact of basalt and cinders at moderate depths."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cambern soils are on nearly level to moderately steep mountain side slopes and mountain tops.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent but are dominantly 2 to 15 percent.  The soils are formed from ash and tuff, with some influence from basalt and cinders.  These soils occur at elevations of 7,000 to 9,000 feet in a continental climate.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 30 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 37 to 47 degrees F.   The frost-free period ranges from 70 to 120 days."

Bushvalley soils are shallow to bedrock and have over 50 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Luna and Brolliar soils have fine-textured argillic horizons.  Sizer soils are shallow to very cindery materials.  Tatiyee soils have over 50 percent coarse fragments and are members of a clayey-skeletal, montmorillonitic family.   The Kessay soils are similar but lack the R horizon that is characteristic of the Cambern soils and are formed from basalt."
