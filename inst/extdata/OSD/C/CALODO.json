The soil between depth of 6 inches and the paralithic contact is moist from December until May and is dry in all parts from July until October. Mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, gray, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown or brown (10YR 4/2, 5/1, 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2). It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam. Pebbles, cobbles and stones make up 3 to 15 percent of the soil by volume. Dry consistence is slightly hard or hard. Structure is subangular blocky or granular. Segregated lime is present below depth of 9 inches in the form of seams, filaments and soft masses.\nThe Cr material is weathered calcareous shale or sandstone."

Elevations are 500 to 2,500 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches. Average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 61 degrees F.
