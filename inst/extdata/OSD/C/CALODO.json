  "OVERVIEW": "The Calodo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous shale and sandstone. Calodo soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soil between depth of 6 inches and the paralithic contact is moist from December until May and is dry in all parts from July until October. Mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, gray, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown or brown (10YR 4/2, 5/1, 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2). It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam. Pebbles, cobbles and stones make up 3 to 15 percent of the soil by volume. Dry consistence is slightly hard or hard. Structure is subangular blocky or granular. Segregated lime is present below depth of 9 inches in the form of seams, filaments and soft masses.\nThe Cr material is weathered calcareous shale or sandstone."

Fontana and Nacimiento soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Lebec soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 59 degrees F. and are underlain by hard limestone rock at depths of 30 to 40 inches. Salinas and Sorrento soils are more than 60 inches deep."

Elevations are 500 to 2,500 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches. Average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 61 degrees F. The average frost-free season is about 160 to 300 days."
