  "OVERVIEW": "The Conata series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in vari-colored clayey residuum from mudstone or shale.  These soils are on breaks along drainageways near badlands.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

The soil materials reflect the color of the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 dry or moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay or clay and averages between 45 and 55 percent clay.  The Bw horizon contains common or many, fine or very fine fragments of mudstone or shale.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay or clay and has common to many very fine fragments of shale.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonates and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is variegated mudstone or shale and has hue of 10R to 5Y.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Surfaces are plane or convex, and slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  Conata soils formed in vividly colored clays weathered from mudstone or shale bedrock.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."

Epping, Imlay, Keota and Orella soils are on positions similar to the Conata soils.  Epping soils are loamy and Keota soils have a coarse-silty control section and are deeper to bedrock.   Imlay soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Orella soils are strongly alkaline and have an exchangeable sodium percentage of 8 to 30 percent. Larvie, Metre and Norrest soils typically are on more gentle slopes.  Larvie and Metre soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches, and in addition, Metre soils have a mollic epipedon.  Norrest soils have an argillic horizon."
