  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: There appears to be no significant difference in soil characteristics or properties of the Grady and Coxville soils that warrants separation at the series level. Each series was proposed before 1910 by the respective states (Georgia and North Carolina) and they have been maintained since. They were separated on clay and silt content in the 1960s. However, Coxville soils have not been consistently correlated with less than 45 percent clay (or 30 percent silt) in the particle-size control section.  The November 2025 revision updated the format.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (Ap and Eg horizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 23 to 28 centimeters (9 to 11 inches) (Eg horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone between depths of 28 and 183 centimeters (11 and 72 inches) (BEg, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)"
