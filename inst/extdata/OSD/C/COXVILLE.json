  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: There appears to be no significant difference in soil characteristics or properties of the Grady and Coxville soils that warrants separation at the series level. Each series was proposed before 1910 by the respective states (Georgia and North Carolina) and they have been maintained since.  They were separated on clay and silt content in the 1960s. However, Coxville have not been consistently correlated with less than 45 percent clay (or 30 percent silt) in the particle-size control section..\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and Eg horizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 9 to 11 inches (Eg horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone between depths of 11 and 72 inches (BEg, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0045 COXVILLE    0-2    57-70    190-245   38-52   25-450\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind    Months   Bedrock Hardness\nNC0045 NONE            0-1.0  APPARENT  NOV-APR  >80\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture         3-Inch  No-10    Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0045  0-11  FSL SL L        0-0    100-100    5-27    2-7\nNC0045 11-72  CL SC C         0-0    100-100   35-60    4-7\nNC0045 72-80  VAR              -        -        -       -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-   O.M.
