  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Crowfoot soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches, and are noncalcareous in at least the upper 3 inches of the C horizon if the solum exceeds 40 inches.  Base saturation in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon usually exceeds 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and in the C horizon and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizon range from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon usually has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically coarse sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand and with a large proportion of the sand fraction being medium, coarse, and very coarse angular granite sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically coarse sandy loam and has less than 18 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kelvin, Redtom, Tomah, and Westcreek series.  Kelvin soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Redtom soils have hue of 5YR or redder, soils have B2t horizons in which silicate clay is accumulating in discontinuous lamellae.  Westcreek soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in a major part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crowfoot soils are on alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and upland hills and ridges.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 15 or more percent.  The soils formed in parent sediments weathered residually or locally transported from the arkosic beds of the Dawson and Arapahoe formations.  In some locations the parent sedimentary rock occurs above 60 inches but is of such low contrast that it cannot be consistently identified.  The average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer."
