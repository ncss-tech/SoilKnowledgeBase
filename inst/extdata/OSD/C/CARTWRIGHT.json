Paragon soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Buckeye soils do not have an activity class family designated, but are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Kiakus soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Campfour soils are forested, have O horizons and color hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR. Elmore soils are deep to bedrock. Hyprairie soils have upper solums dominated by loess over 2Bt horizons and rock fragments within the argillic horizon not of granitic origin. Lauby soils have buried Bt horizons, are forested with O horizons, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Newlig soils formed in sediments and have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout. Nisene soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have average annual soil temperatures of 56 to 58 degrees F. Rudo soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Roseburg soils have average annual soil temperatures of 52 to 57 degrees F.and have redoximorphic features below 40 inches. Swalecreek soils have Btc horizons with hard manganese concretions and rock fragments not of granitic origin. Yaxing soils are forested and slightly alkaline below the surface layer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cartwright soils are on fan remnants, canyon walls and hill footslopes and backslopes at elevations of 2,500 to 5,600 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from granitic rocks. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 22 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days."
