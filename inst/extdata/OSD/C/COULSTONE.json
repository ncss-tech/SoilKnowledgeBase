  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  These soils have both angular chert fragments and rounded sandstone fragments up to 24 inches in diameter. Bouldery or stony phases are allowed.  Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 75 percent and of this up to 30 percent may be larger than 3 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The AE and E horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are the gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is the very gravelly or very stony analogues of sandy loam or loam. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of clay loam, silty clay, clay, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Coulstone soils are on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops.  They formed in a thick regolith from acid sandstones with lenses of cherty limestones or cherty dolomites.  Slope gradients range from about 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Bender soils are moderately deep over bedrock and on similar positions.  Hobson, Lebanon, Nixa, and Plato soils have fragipans and commonly are on less sloping higher landscape positions."
