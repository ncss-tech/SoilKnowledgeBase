  "OVERVIEW": "The Coulstone series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils of the uplands.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from acid sandstone with lenses of cherty limestone or cherty dolomite.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",
