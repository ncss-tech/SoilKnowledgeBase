  "OVERVIEW": "The Chaix series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from acid intrusive ingneous rock, mainly granite or granodiorite.  Chaix soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock.  The soil between a depth of about 10 to 30 inches becomes dry in all parts sometime in June or the first few days of July and remains dry until sometime in October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 59 degrees F.  The base saturation in the upper 30 inches ranges from 15 to 60 percent.  The soil is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  Clay content averages 5 to 15 percent.  Gravel and cobbles range from 1 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4.  Some pedons have thin 2.5Y 5/2 and 10YR 3/1 moist A1 horizons.  It contains 2 to 6 percent organic matter.  This horizon has weak or moderate granular structure.  It is slightly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 6/4 or 7/4.  Moist color are 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 5/6.  The chroma and/or value is at least one unit higher than the A horizon.  It has 0.25 to 0.95 percent organic matter.  It is slightly acid thru strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 8/2, 8/3, or 8/4.\nThe Cr horizon is strongly weathered granitic rock that is easily dug by hand tools but retains the original rock structure.  Root penetration is restricted with only a few extending along joints or fractures."
