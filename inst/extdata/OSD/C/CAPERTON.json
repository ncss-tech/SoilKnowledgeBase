  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock is 8 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil below depth of 8 inches is usually dry all of the time from June until October, and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Fine angular gravel comprises 5 to 35 percent of the soil volume.  The soils are gravelly coarse sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and have less than 18 percent clay.  Base saturation is greater than 75 percent throughout to the paralithic contact.  The soils are slightly acid or medium acid.  The organic matter is more than one percent and decreases regularly to less than one percent at a depth of 8 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, brown, or yellowish brown (10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 7.5YR 5/4).  Moist value and chroma are 2 or 3.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C1 horizon is brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown or light brown (10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4).  The C3r horizon has moderately thick clay films coating fracture planes in some pedons."

Elevations are 200 to 1,500 feet.  The climate is moist subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature is 44 degrees F; average July temperature is 76 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 220 to 270 days."
