  "OVERVIEW": "The Chanybuck series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in ignimbrites with influence from volcanic ash.  The Chanybuck soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
