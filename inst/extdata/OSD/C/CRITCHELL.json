  "OVERVIEW": "The Critchell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from reddish brown sedimentary rocks. Critchell soils are on fans, terraces, strike valleys and valley sideslopes. Slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
