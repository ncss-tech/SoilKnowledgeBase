  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches. Solum thickness is 24 to 48 inches. These soils are generally noncalcareous; but some pedons are calcareous below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above 40 inches and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. it is sandy loam or loam with stony and gravelly modifiers.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly light clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR. It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly loam. Stratification is common in the lower part."

Ascalon, Capulin, Featherlegs, Harlan, Kirtley, Palmer Canyon, Satanta, Sugardee, Wages and Wolf soils have horizons that contain secondary lime. Dagflat, Hargreave, Kirtley, Rosebud and Ryegate soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths less than 40 inches. Bresser, Lavate and Noden soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the A and B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from reddish brown sedimentary rocks. The soils are in a warm semiarid climate with annual precipitation of 15 to 19 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 125 to 140 days."
