  "OVERVIEW": "The Critchell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed, stratified alluvium derived from reddish brown sedimentary rocks. Critchell soils are on fans, terraces, and valley sidelsopes and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are generally noncalcareous; but some pedons are calcareous below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above 40 inches and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. it is sandy loam or loam with stony and gravelly modifiers.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly light clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR. It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly loam. Stratification is common in the lower part."
