  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Chaffee series are deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvial or glacial outwash material from mixed sources.  They are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, low terraces, fans, or glacial outwash channels.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
