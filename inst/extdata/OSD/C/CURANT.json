  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soils are usually moist but dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 70 to 90 consecutive days within the 3-month period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 53 degrees F. The solum ranges from 30 to 40 inches thick. A few rock fragments may occur in the sola, up to 30 percent in that part of the C horizon above 40 inches and up to 60 percent below. The weighted average of material coarser than very fine sand within the control section is less than 15 percent. The soils range from neutral in the sola to mildly and moderately alkaline in the C horizon. The a horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 0 to 5 percent pebbles. The B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, with value of 3 moist and 5 dry to depths of 20 inches or more. It is heavy silt loam to light silty clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent pebbles. The B3 and IIC horizons above 40 inches range from silt loam, or very fine sandy loam, to loam with 10 to 35 percent pebbles. They are moderately or strongly calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Asotin, Condon, Snow, and Walla Walla series. Asotin and Condon soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Snow soils have an irregular decrease in organic material and lack secondary lime within 60 inches. Walla Walla soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Curant soils are at elevations of 2,200 to 3,700 feet on north aspects of moderately steep to very steep slopes. These soils formed in loess over mixed medium and moderately coarse textured old alluvium or colluvial material from sedimentary and igneous rocks of mixed mineralogy. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 49 degrees F.; the mean winter temperature is 31 degrees to 35 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 62 degrees to 64 degrees F. The average frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is approximately 50 to 70 days."

McMeen soils have duripans.  Rail soils have more than 35 percent clay throughout the solum and are somewhat poorly drained."
