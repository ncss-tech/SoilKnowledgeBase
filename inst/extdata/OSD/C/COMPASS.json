  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.  Depth to horizons containing 5 percent or more plinthite ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Content of ironstone nodules ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons.  Depth to the B2t horizons ranges primarily from 40 to 60 inches but as deep as 80 inches in some pedons.  These horizons are considered diagnostic for the series.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value 5 of through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, and red range from few to many.  Below 30 inches, areas of iron depletions in shades of gray range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btv horizon has hue 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of chroma 6 or 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, and below 30 inches, gray, range from common to many.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to about 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon is a reticulate feature and has no dominant color.  It is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown, gray, and white.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  In some pedons, they contain a few small pockets or lenses of sand or sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Perdido series is in the same family while the Brogdon and Poarch series are in closely related families.  The well drained Perdido soils are on similar positions but have more than 20 percent silt in the control section and have a water table deeper than 5 feet.  Brogdon and Poarch soils are in the semiactive family.  In addition, Brogdon soils are well drained while Poarch soils are moderately well and well drained."

They formed in thick loamy and clayey marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 52 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F."

The very poorly and poorly drained Alapaha soils are on lower adjacent positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  The somewhat poorly drained Ardilla and Leefield soils are on lower positions.  In addition Ardilla soils have fine-loamy control sections, and have fragic qualities while Leefield soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Blanton and Bonifay soils are on similar positions and have surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.  In addition, Blanton soils are moderately well to somewhat excessively drained and have less than 5 percent plinthite, by volume.  Bonifay soils are well drained. The very poorly drained Dorovan and Pamlico soils are on adjacent lower positions and are Histosols.  The well drained Dothan soils are on similar positions and have fine-loamy sections.  The very poorly and poorly drained Pansey soils are on adjacent lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections.  The very poorly drained Torhunta soils are on adjacent positions, have less than 5 percent plinthite, by volume, have less developed subsoils and have umbric epipedons."
