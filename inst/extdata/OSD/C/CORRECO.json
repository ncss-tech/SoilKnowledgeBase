The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to November 15 and above 47 degrees F from about April 1 to November 1.\nThe solum ranges from 46 to 64 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  The soils are slightly or medium acid.  Base saturation exceeds 75 percent throughout the upper 30 inches.\nThe Correco soils have dark brown, medium and slightly acid, sandy loam A horizons and brown, prismatic, slightly acid, clay B2t horizons grading to pale brown C horizons.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, dark brown, and brown in hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It has weak or moderate platy or granular structure.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, pale brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown or light brown in hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It has coarse prismatic or coarse angular blocky structure.  It is clay or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.\nThe C horizon is loam or clay loam."
