(6 to 15 inches thick)\nR--35 inches; dusky red (10R 3/3) moderately weathered shale bedrock, less than 4 inches between fractures; bedrock inclination greater than 30 percent; discontinuous clay and silt bridging on the rock fragments.  Excavation difficulty, high.  Excavation by tile spade is difficult, but easily done by pick using over-the-head swing."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 35 inches. Illite is the dominant clay mineral with moderate amounts of vermiculite and chlorite.  Percent coarse fragments range from 5 to 25 percent in the A and BA horizons, 25 to 55 percent in the Bw and BC horizons, and 40 to 80 percent in the C horizon, with the particle size control section averaging more than 35 percent.  Fragments are generally channers or cobbles of reddish siltstone, fine-grained sandstone or shale. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 10R, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is silt loam or loam.  The clay content of individual horizons ranges from 15 to 25 percent and the silt content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Very few, faint, clay films are in pores, on rock fragments, and on faces of peds in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 10R, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam."

Berks, Brownstown, Brownsville, Cadosia, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin, Judyville, Manlius, Matewan, Nailkeg, Peaks, and Sylco soils have hues yellower than 5YR.  The Blasdell Centralpark and Parkersoils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Keyesville soils have less than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lippitt soils have been glaciated and formed in gneiss, schist, and granite.  Warwick soils formed in glacial outwash.  Wyoming soils contain rounded rock fragments.\nAlbrights, Gainesboro, Kedron, Klinesville, Leck Kill, Penn, and Ungers are in related families.  Albrights, Gainesboro, Leck Kill, Penn, and Ungers soils have argillic horizons.  Klinesville soils have a lithic contact at 10 to 20 inches.  Kedron soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 80 percent. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Climate is humid continental.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches, frost free days range from 120 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 400 feet to 3000 feet above sea level."
