    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. The particle size control section averages 48 to 60 percent clay. Subhorizons in the upper half of the control that average more than 55 percent clay are less than 10 inches thick.\nThe A or Ap horizon has color value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 with mottles of higher chroma.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and the lower part 10YR to 5Y. Color value is 4 or 5 and chroma is 1 or 2. Fe depletions and masses have the same hue and value with chroma ranging to 8. The upper part is strongly acid to moderately acid and the lower part is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have 2B horizons with textures of clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon commonly is variegated with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 1 to 8. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam or fine sandy loam and ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

Adco soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a Bt horizon with chroma of 3 or more. Appanoose soils have less than 10 percent sand in the control section. The Belinda, Brooklyn, Cisne, Cowden, Denny, Glensted, Rubio, Smileyville and Wagner soils average less than 48 percent clay in the particle size control section. Holcomb soils have a dark colored A horizons thicker than 10 inches. Putnam soils have subhorizons that have more than 55 percent clay and are more than 10 inches thick in the middle one-third of the control section."

The soils formed in loess underlain by alluvium or loess and alluvium. The mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gifford, Moniteau, Nodaway, and Wabash soils. Gifford soils do not have an abrupt textural change and are on short slopes below the Chariton soil. Moniteau soils have less clay in the B horizon. Nodaway soils have less clay, do not have B horizons, and are stratified. Wabash soils have thick dark surface layers. Nodaway and Wabash soils are below the Chariton soils and generally closer to the main stream. Moniteau soils are on similar positions."
