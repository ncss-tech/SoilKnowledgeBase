  "OVERVIEW": "The Chariton series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loess underlain by alluvium or loess and alluvium. These soils are on high floodplains or low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

Color value is 4 or 5 and chroma is 1 or 2. Fe depletions and masses have the same hue and value with chroma ranging to 8. The upper part is strongly acid to moderately acid and the lower part is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have 2B horizons with textures of clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon commonly is variegated with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 1 to 8. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam or fine sandy loam and ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

Gifford soils do not have an abrupt textural change and are on short slopes below the Chariton soil. Moniteau soils have less clay in the B horizon. Nodaway soils have less clay, do not have B horizons, and are stratified. Wabash soils have thick dark surface layers. Nodaway and Wabash soils are below the Chariton soils and generally closer to the main stream. Moniteau soils are on similar positions."
