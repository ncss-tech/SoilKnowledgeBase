Fine 2 to 5 mm pebbles cover from 20 to 50 percent of the surface.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The material above the surface of the weathered granitic rock is dry from early July to mid October (about 100 to 110 days).  The soil temperature at the paralithic contact exceeds 41 degrees F from mid March to late November (about 150 to 280 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from mid April to late October.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2,or 4/2.  It has 15 to 35 percent fine pebbles (2 to 5 mm).\nThe C horizon averages 35 to 60 percent fine pebbles."
