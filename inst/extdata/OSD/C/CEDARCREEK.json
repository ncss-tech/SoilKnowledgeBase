    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  : (1) These soils were formerly mapped as strip mine spoils; Udorthents, sandstone and mudstone, low base, or Udorthents, mudstone and sandstone, low base. (2) Under the West Virginia University proposed classification, these soils would have been classified Typic Udispolents. (3) Lithochromic mottles have inherited their colors from rocks. (4) The 8/00 revision updates this series to 8th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards. The CEC activity class placement is based on sample S75WV-061-002, which averages about 0.50.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 00 to 03 inches (Ap horizon) Other soil features identified with this pedon: The percentage of any rock type is less than 65 percent of the total rock fragments in the particle-size control section (10 - 40 inches C1, C2 horizons).\n2014 edit updates. Semitab formatting\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data is available from the KSSL for the following pedons correlated as the Cedarcreek series: 73PA033020, 73PA033021, 73PA033022, 73PA033024; 74PA005015, 74PA005016; 74PA019042,  74PA019044; 74PA031002; 74PA033025; 074PA125048; 075WV061002.\nMineralogy data from West Virginia University indicates that Cedarcreek soils have mixed mineralogy.\nRevised: 2/88-JWB,BLW,LDS; 8/2000-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
