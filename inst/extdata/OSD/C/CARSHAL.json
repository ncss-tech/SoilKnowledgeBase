    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from July through early October for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.\nMean summer soil temperature - 59 to 62 degrees F.\nOchric epipedon thickness - 1 to 3 inches.\nDepth to bedrock - 4 to 14 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered andesitic rock.  Hard, unweathered rock is within 25 inches of the soil surface.\nSodium fluoride pH - 8.5 to 9.0.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 25 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.\nA horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nC horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.  Color value 4 or 5 dry or 3 moist are influenced by the dark color of the parent rock.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loam.\nClay content: 18 to 27 percent.\nRock fragments: 30 to 50 percent.\nPararock fragments: 15 to 30 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 1 percent.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carshal soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

Celeridge, Loope, and Pinew soils have mollic epipedons, argillic horizons, and lithic contacts at depths of 14 to 20 inches.  Dogbed soils are very deep, have thick mollic epipedons, and have argillic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 2 inches (A horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 5 inches to underlying weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 5 inches (A and C horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, nonacid, frigid, shallow Typic Xerorthents.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
