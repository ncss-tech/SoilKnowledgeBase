  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chivington series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, terraces, landslides and foothills.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
