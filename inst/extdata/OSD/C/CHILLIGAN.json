  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F. The thickness of the volcanic ash influenced loess deposits ranges from 14 to 26 inches.  The bulk density of the loess mantle is assumed less than 0.90 grams/cc and the phosphorous retention is assumed greater than 85 percent. The weighted average particle size of the underlying material is coarse-loamy.  There are less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout the control section.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid in the solum and moderately to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have hue moist of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bh horizon, when present, has hue moist of 2.5YR or 5YR; value moist of 2.5 or 3; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bs and Bsb horizons have hue moist of 2.5YR through 7.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue moist of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 3 or 4.\nThe 2C horizons have hue moist of 10YR through 5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Textures are stratified and include fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam and silty clay loam."

Boulder Point soils are stony throughout the lower control section.  Cohoe and Suntrana soils are mottled in the control section.  Kenai soils have more than 18 percent clay throughout the lower control section.  Kroto and Strandline soils are not stratified.  Swanson, Tuomi and Whitsol soils do not have lenses with greater than 18 percent clay in the substratum."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in an admixture of eolian silt and volcanic ash overlying stratified medium and fine textured glacial outwash material.  The climate is transitional maritime-continental with the average annual precipitation of about 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F."
