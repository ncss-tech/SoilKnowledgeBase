  "OVERVIEW": "The Chilligan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash influenced loess overlying stratified loamy glacial outwash and lacustrine deposits.  Chilligan soils are on glacial outwash plains and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The bulk density of the loess mantle is assumed less than 0.90 grams/cc and the phosphorous retention is assumed greater than 85 percent. The weighted average particle size of the underlying material is coarse-loamy.  There are less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout the control section.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid in the solum and moderately to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have hue moist of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bh horizon, when present, has hue moist of 2.5YR or 5YR; value moist of 2.5 or 3; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bs and Bsb horizons have hue moist of 2.5YR through 7.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue moist of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 3 or 4.\nThe 2C horizons have hue moist of 10YR through 5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Textures are stratified and include fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam and silty clay loam."
