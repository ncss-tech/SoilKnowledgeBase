  "OVERVIEW": "The Casaga series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with a component of gypsiferous sediments on erosional fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

Corum soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Garces and Gothard soils have E1 horizons and lack very gravelly material in the control section.  Leuhman and Tipnat soils do not have very gravelly lower horizons.  Norob soils have less than 35 percent gravel in the C horizon, and lack gypsum. Polvadero soils do not receive the 10 to 20 day summer precipitation."

The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources, including limestone, sandstone, shale, quartzite and gypsiferous sediments.  Elevations are 1500 to 3800 feet.  Mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches.  Frost-free season is about 250 days.The climate has hot dry summers and mild winters, typical of the Mojave Desert, transitional to Sonoran."
