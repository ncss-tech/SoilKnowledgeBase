    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chinlini soils are on treads of fan terraces and on summits of mesas.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from Jurassic and Triassic siltstone and sandstone and Tertiary quartz diorite.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 6,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Tsezhin soils are loamy-skeletal and occur under pinyon-juniper woodland.  Wetherill soils are very deep, fine-silty, and occur on eolian-mantled surfaces."

The control sections of two pedons were wet sieved to determine the percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand (less than 0.1 mm).  The weighted averages of the two pedons ranged from 7 to 11 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
