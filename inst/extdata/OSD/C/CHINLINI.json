  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinlini series consists of deep to hardpan, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone, and quartz diorite.  Chinlini soils are on treads of fan terraces and on summits of mesas.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
