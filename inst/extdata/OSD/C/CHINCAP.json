  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock and the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. The particle-size control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 8 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent angular sandstone fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon is typically free of carbonates, but irregular and discontinuous pockets of carbonates are in some pedons. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe bedrock consists of hard sandstone many feet thick. The soil bedrock interface is a lithic contact."

Baggs, Hopley, Mott, Relan, Tally, Unaweep, and Victor soils are more than 40 inches deep. Baxton, Bitterroot, and Vebar soils have a paralithic contact in the particle-size control section. Baxton and Weedzunit soils have a horizon with more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in slopewash alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone. Elevation is 6,500 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches, the mean annual temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

Alflack soils are sandy-skeletal, have mean summer soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F., and do not have a mollic epipedon. Castner soils are loamy-skeletal and shallow. Sneffels soils are fine, have an argillic horizon, and have a mean summer soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F."
