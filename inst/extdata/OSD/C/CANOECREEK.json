    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canoecreek soils are on linear to concave or convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 110 percent. Elevations are 185 to 730 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone or conglomerate. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
