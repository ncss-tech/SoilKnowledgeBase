  "OVERVIEW": "The Cupel series consists of shallow, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils are formed in colluvium and alluvium from rhyolite and basalt.  Slopes range from 35 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
