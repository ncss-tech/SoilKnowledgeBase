  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarkelen series consists of very deep, well, moderately well or somewhat excessively drained soils formed in stratified recent stream alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources.  Clarkelen soils are on flood plains and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This soil typically lacks horizons of continuous carbonate accumulation.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 8 inches.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent but may range to 15 percent.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth; and thin, highly variable textural strata usually occur between 6 and 24 inches.  The particle-size control section contains from 5 to 18 percent clay and is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam when averaged.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam but may range from loamy sand to clay loam depending upon the most recent deposition.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has an EC of 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.  Nitrogen and phosphorus levels are not abnormally enriched.  Some pedons have an AC horizon up to 8 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture centers on sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam, but strata of very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand of varying thickness occur.  Skeletal material may occur below 40 inches in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  EC is typically 4 mmhos/cm or less but may range up to 8 when irrigated or where it receives saline discharge from surrounding shale beds."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cameo, Colorow, Glenberg, Kornman, Radnik, Redbank and Tapicito series (Colorow, Kornman, Radnik and Redbank will likely compete when their classifications are updated).  Cameo, Radnik and Tapicito soils are usually dry in the moisture control section during April, May, and early June.  Colorow soils are mottled in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Glenberg soils have more favorable temperature and moisture relationships for growing crops (soil temperature of more than 52 degrees and frost-free period of more than 130 days).  Kornman soils have over-thickened nitrogen- and phosphate- enriched, manmade surface horizons resulting from application of silty irrigation water over long periods of time.  Redbank soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clarkelen soils are on flood plains and terraces adjacent to floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in stratified but dominantly moderately coarse textured recent stream alluvium originally weathered from sedimentary rock. Elevation is 3,500 to 6,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 12 inches with over half falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October. Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
