  "OVERVIEW": "The Casemore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on low stream terraces paralleling major streams of the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) and the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie (MLRA 135A) Major Land Resource Areas. They formed in loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 56 inches.",

Houlka, Leeper, Marietta, and Sucarnoochee soils are on adjacent flood plains. The Houlka, Leeper, and Sucarnoochee soils are clayey throughout. Marietta soils are moderately well drained and do not have an argillic horizon. The poorly drained Minter soils are in slightly lower positions on stream terraces and have a clayey argillic horizon."
