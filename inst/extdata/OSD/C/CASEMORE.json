    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the A, Ap and E horizon except where the surface has been limed. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the Bt horizon and very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the Bt horizon and Btg horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redox accumulations in shades of brown and red and redox depletions in shades of brown and gray range from none to common.\nTexture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, present in some pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nTransition horizons, such as EB or BE, occur in some pedons. They have a range in color and texture similar to that of the respective E or B horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown, red, yellow, and gray. Redox features in shades of brown, yellow, red and gray range from few or many. Soft masses and/or concretions of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, present in some pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red range from few to many. Soft black masses and/or concretions of iron and manganese range from few to many.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Casemore soils are on low stream terraces paralleling major streams of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Blackland Prairie. They developed in thick beds of loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches. The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Faunsdale, Freest, Houlka, Leeper, Marietta, Minter, Sucarnoochee, and Vaiden soils. Faunsdale and Vaiden soils are on adjacent uplands at slightly higher elevations and are clayey throughout. The moderately well drained Freest soils are in slightly higher, more convex positions. Houlka, Leeper, Marietta, and Sucarnoochee soils are on adjacent flood plains. The Houlka, Leeper, and Sucarnoochee soils are clayey throughout. Marietta soils are moderately well drained and do not have an argillic horizon. The poorly drained Minter soils are in slightly lower positions on stream terraces and have a clayey argillic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Casemore soils are somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow and permeability is moderate. Free water is at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 feet during December to April in normal years. Most areas are subject to rare or occasional flooding for brief periods during late winter and spring."
