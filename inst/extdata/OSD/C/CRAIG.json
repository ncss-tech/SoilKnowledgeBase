  "OVERVIEW": "The Craig series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in cherty residuum weathered from Pennsylvanian age limestone.  These soils are on summits, shoulders and side slopes within the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
