  "OVERVIEW": "The Colvard series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains in the southern Appalachian Mountains.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is 52 inches near the type location.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The loamy sediments range from 40 to 60 inches or more in thickness over deposits of stratified sandy, loamy, gravelly, or cobbly sediments.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent to a depth of 40 inches, and from 0 to 80 percent below 40 inches.  Flakes of mica range from few to common throughout the control section.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where the value is 3 and the chroma is 2 or 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon that has the same texture and color range as the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features of iron depletions and masses of accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or gray below 40 inches.  Within a depth of 40 inches, the C horizon is dominantly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have thin strata (less than 5 inches thick) of loamy sand or sand. Below 40 inches, the C horizon may consist of stratified sandy or loamy sediments that range from 0 to 80 percent by volume rock fragments.  The rock fragments are mainly gravel and cobbles."

Arkaqua, Codorus, Congaree, French, Suches, and Transylvania series have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, French soils have contrasting textures within one meter.  Biltmore soils are sandy.  Comus soils have a cambic horizon.  Kickapoo soils have buried A horizons at 20 to 40 inches.  Rosman soils have an umbric epipedon.  Toccoa soils have mean annual temperatures of more than 59 degrees F.  Wirt soils formed in alluvium from glacial till."

Biltmore and Ostin soils are sandy and are generally adjacent to streams.  Iotla soils have mottles of 2 or lower chroma within 20 inches of the surface and are in slightly lower positions.  Tate soils have an argillic horizon and Tusquitee soils have a cambic horizon.  These soils are on fans, foot slopes, and benches adjacent to the flood plain.  Toxaway soils have a dominant matrix color of chroma 2 or less.  These soils occupy the lower parts of the flood plain."

Important crops grown are corn for grain and silage, small grains, truck crops, burley tobacco, and pasture.  Common forest species include yellow-poplar, northern red oak, black oak, white oak, eastern white pine, American sycamore, river birch, white ash, black locust, basswood, and blackgum.  Rhododendron, red maple, and blueberry are common understory plants."

Soils previously correlated as Comus within MLRA 130 are covered by this series.  The 2/99 revision updates classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  This soil is placed in the active CEC activity family based on comparison with other soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches below the surface (Ap horizon)\nNonacid feature - pH of 5.5 or more in the 10 to 40 inch control section\nMLRA: 130           SIR: NC0105\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
