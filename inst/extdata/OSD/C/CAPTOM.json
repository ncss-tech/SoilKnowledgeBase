Slopes range from 35 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Berland soils are very shallow to sandstone and occur on non-wooded knolls and benches.  Bikeyah soils lack argillic horizons, are non-wooded and occur on toeslopes.  Klizhin soils lack argillic horizons and occur on footslopes below Captom soils.  Retaw soils are very poorly drained and have standing water on the surface."
