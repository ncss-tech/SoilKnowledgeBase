  "OVERVIEW": "The Captom series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone on backslopes of high plateaus, mesas, and structural benches. Permeability is rapid in the epipedon and moderate in the subsoil.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
