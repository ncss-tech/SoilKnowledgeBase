(A horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from about 4 to 39 inches.  (E, Bw, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 horizons).   Cambic horizon has argillans in most pedons, but lacks clay increase to qualify as argillic horizon.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the E, the Bw, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and part of the 3Bt3 horizon)\nThe 2/2002 revision changes the subgroup classification from Mollic Hapludalfs to Typic Haplustepts. NSSL data does not support an argillic horizon, and the moisture regime was judged to be ustic rather than udic. When established in 1987 the subgroup classification was Dystric Eutrochrepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Sampled for characterization as Pedon No.  S78NM-043-1(1-6) National Soil Survey Laboratory Pedon No. 78P-3695 to 3700.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
