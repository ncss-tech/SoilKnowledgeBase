    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Candor series is established for soils in a sandy family that have sufficient clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon within 100 centimeters and have loamy or finer texture from 100 to 200 centimeters. Candor soils occurring on smooth to gentle landscapes on interstream divides may contain plinthite (3 to 10 percent) at depths of more than 150 centimeters. The criteria for placing this series in Kandiudults is based on the double clay bulge argillic horizon extending to 150 centimeters or more. Candor soils have been included in mapping with the Blanton series in North Carolina.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 58 centimeters (about 23 inches); Ap and E horizons\nGrossarenic feature--sand and loamy sand texture in the horizons from the surface to a depth of 160 centimeters (about 63 inches); Ap, E, Bt, BE, E' and B't1 horizons\nUpper argillic horizon--the zone from 58 to 94 centimeters (about 23 to 37 inches); Bt horizon\nLower argillic horizon--the zone from 145 to 203 centimeters (about 57 to 63 inches); B't1 horizons\nKandic horizon--the zone from 160 to 203 centimeters (about 63 to 80 inches); B't2 and B't3 horizons\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size data from 3 pedons; North Carolina State University, Department of Soils, 8/81.  Characterization Data; NSSC, Pedon (S03NC123003); Project (C204USNC115).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
