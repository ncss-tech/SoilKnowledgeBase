  "OVERVIEW": "The Culving series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentine with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess.  Culving soils are on mountainsides at elevations of 2,400 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from serpentine and minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,400 to 5,000 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with a snowpack from about December through March.  The average annual precipitation is 27 to 50 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 135 to 170 days."
