Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a layer of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves from 1 1/2 inches to the mineral soil surface (Oi horizon); an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches, mixed (E, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 5 to 16 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 16 to 19 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 19 inches (R horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 16 inches (Bw, Bw2 horizons).  Caseypeak soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
