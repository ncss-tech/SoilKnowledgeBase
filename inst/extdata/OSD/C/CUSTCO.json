    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Drage, Rawnjay, Remount, Searla, and Swampydraw (T) series. Broad soils are moderately deep to weathering fractured bedrock.  Drage and Searla soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the control section and moderately slow permeability.  Small and Sheep Creek soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Swampydraw soils are currently very similar and will probably be combined with Custco."

The soils formed in slope alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches and average annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
