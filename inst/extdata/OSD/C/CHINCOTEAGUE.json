  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the A and C horizon is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  After moist incubation, reaction is ultra acid (pH 3.5) with jarosite mottle formation within a depth of 20 inches.  Salt is more than 2 percent within the upper 40 inches.  Electrical conductivity is greater than 16 mmhos/cm.  Mucky, mucky peat, or peat surface horizons 1 to 15 inches thick are in some pedons.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5BG or is neutral, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5BG or is neutral, value of 2 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  The upper part is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The lower part, below 40 inches, is variable and ranges from coarse sand through silty clay loam."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In the past, Chincoteague soils were included in the miscellaneous land class Tidal Marsh.  Darmondy and Foss (Darmondy, R.G. and J. E. Foss. Tidal marsh soils of Maryland. Md. Agric. Exp.  Sta., Univ. of Md. College Park, Md. Mp 930, Oct. 1978) also proposed the name Chincoteague for these soils.  These soils classify as members of the fine-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic family of Sulfidic Almyraquents according to the Committee VIII report on Soils of Coastal Wetlands, their Classification, and Correlation.  These soils contain sufficient salt to classify in a Salic subgroup of Sulfaquents based on the definition of a salic horizon in Soil Taxonomy if such a subgroup existed.  The presence of sulfidic material and a salic horizon are the main diagnostic features of the soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey lab data support a fine-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Sulfaquents placement for the typical and 11 other profiles.  Data for the official site location and other pedons are published in Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 85-8, 1985, \"Soil Classifications and Floral Relationships of Seaside Salt Marsh Soils in Accomac and Northampton Counties, Virginia\" by W. J. Edmonds, et al.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
