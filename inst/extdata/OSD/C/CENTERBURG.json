Bogart soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the middle part of the series control section. Cygnet and Jenera soils have more than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Haney and Thackery soils average more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Houcktown soils have a densic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Jugtown soils are more alkaline than moderately acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Nicely soils are deeper than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Scattersville soils formed in mountain colluvium (solifluctate) from mixed basic and acidic rock materials. Swampoodle soils formed in local colluvium over residuum derived from greenstone schist, biotite schist, and basic gneiss. Tuscola soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Vanlue soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Williamstown soils have rock fragments of dominantly limestone and crystalline lithology."

The well drained Amanda soils are on higher knolls and ridges or on more sloping areas along drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Bennington soils are on lower knolls and ridges or on less sloping areas along drainageways. The very poorly drained Condit soils are in depressions. The very poorly drained Pewamo soils have a mollic epipedon and are in depressions. The well drained Loudonville and Mechanicsburg soils are on nearby areas where the bedrock is less than 152 cm (60 inches) and are moderately deep and deep to bedrock, respectively."
