    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 16 to 38 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has gray, light gray, or light brownish gray silt coatings on the faces of peds.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have E or B/E horizons.  Some pedons have columnar peds that are degraded both in color and in structure, with streaks of gray or light gray extending an inch or more into the columns.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The Btn horizon contains 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand that is fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate; most pedons have accumulations of gypsum or other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Eckman, Embden, Gardena, Swenoda, and Tiffany soils do not have a natric horizon.  In addition, Eckman, Embden, Gardena and Swenoda soils have less clay in the control section and are on slightly higher parts of the landscape.  The somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Tiffany soils are in low swales and depressions.  Turton soils have columnar structure in the Btn horizon and are on similar landscapes."
