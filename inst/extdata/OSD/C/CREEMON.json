    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Creemon soils are on fan skirts, stream terraces, inset fans and fan aprons and beach terraces along shorelines of Pleistocene lakes.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

Antel soils have a particle-size control section of dominantly silty clay loam.  Broyles and Orovada soils are coarse-loamy.  Cren soils lack a cambic horizon.  Hessing soils contain less than 20 percent durinodes in the Bq horizon.  Relley soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Whirlo soils are loamy-skeletal."
