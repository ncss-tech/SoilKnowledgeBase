The soils formed in mixed alluvium from acid igneous and basic igneous rocks.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is humid continental, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with moist, cold winters and dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  Average January temperature is 20 degrees F; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 43 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 60 to 75 days."
