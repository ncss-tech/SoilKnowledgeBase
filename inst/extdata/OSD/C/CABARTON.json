  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabarton series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from acid igneous and basic igneous rock sources.  Cabarton soils are on low alluvial fans and drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
