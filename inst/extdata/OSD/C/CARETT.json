  "OVERVIEW": "The Carett series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated tuff. These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
