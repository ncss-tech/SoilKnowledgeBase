    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft sandstone typically is about 18 inches but ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The control section commonly is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but the ranges includes loamy very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma 2 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam but some is loamy fine sand or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma 2 to 4.  It has weak to moderate grades of subangular blocky or prismatic structure or is massive.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The Cr horizon is platy or massive weakly consolidated soft calcareous sandstone with hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y.  It crushes to a fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand."

Wiggler soils are shallow over weathered shale bedrock and receive less of their total precipitation in spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The Cohagen soils formed in fine sandy loam residuum weathered from the soft sandstone bedrock.  The climate is cool, semiarid with long cold winters and warm moist spring and summer.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls in the spring and summer.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F; mean January temperature is about 10 to 25 degrees F."
