  "OVERVIEW": "The Chia series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in the intertidal zone of mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and tidal marshes adjacent to atolls and karst islands. These soils formed in organic deposits derived predominantly from decomposing mangrove roots and litter over water-deposited coralline sand and gravel. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the organic material in the underlying material. Slope is 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 3685 millimeters (145 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 C (81 F.)",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Chia soils are on Coralline Mangrove Forest plant communities in the intertidal zone of mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and tidal marshes adjacent to atolls and karst islands. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in organic deposits derived predominantly from decomposing mangrove roots and litter over water-deposited coralline sand and gravel. Elevation is -1 to 4 meters (-3.3 to 13 feet.) The soils are flooded daily with ocean salt water during periods of high tide; 30 centimeters above (12 inches) to 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the surface. Areas closer to the ocean are submerged longer than areas closer to land. The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

The Ilachetomel soils are organic throughout with sulfidic materials, flooded semi-diurnally with seawater, and support mangrove vegetation. The Insak soils are moderately deep over coral bedrock. Odesangel soils formed in depressional areas that retain fresh or brackish water. The organic layer is moderately deep with depths typically ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m (1.6 to 3.3 feet), which is shallower than the Ngerungor series. This soil may contain as much as 80 percent organic matter and has neutral soil chemistry (pH 6.6 to 7.3). Coral sand underlies the organic layer. Ngerungor soils have hemic organic deposits greater than 125 centimeters (49 inches), occur in depressional areas, and are saturated throughout the profile."

The soils are flooded very frequently for extremely brief periods, semi-diurnally, by high tides that fluctuate between about 30 centimeters (12 inches) above and 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the soil surface. The soils are ponded frequently for very long periods all months of the year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are in coralline-mangrove forest plant communities and are used for sediment catchment and some timber harvest for local use. The mangroves trap about 30% of sediments in Palau and other coralline islands from entering their coral reefs; it is an important buffer protecting the reefs from excessive sedimentation or eutrophication. Eutrophication will lead to coral reef degradation and stimulate algae growth on corals.  These algae communities vigorously strip excess nutrients from the water as they grow much faster than the corals. As the algae blooms get much larger, they trap more sediment in the reefs and ultimately causing coral bleaching.  As the old algae decay, they consume the oxygen in the water; the low oxygen then will kill off fish, crabs, shrimp, and the living reef devastating tourism and fishing in these local island economies.\nMangrove Forests are located adjacent to the sea and are affected by the semi-diurnal tidal cycle. The remaining areas of mangrove forest are located inland behind coastal strands, which were probably once open to the sea. Mangrove forests are generally closed-canopied with only a single to few mangrove species of Rhizophora spp., Sonneratia spp. Lumnitzera spp., Xylocarpus spp., and Bruguiera spp. These trees are of medium-size (less than 3 m in height), and less than 8 cm dbh.\nThe moderate tree sizes and density of trees within the mangrove forest ecological type result in stands containing a relatively high biomass. The species are adapted to reproducing and surviving on the deep soils inundated with brackish seawater. Although the bottomland soils contain large quantities of organic material, the woody biomass above and below ground serves as an important reservoir of nutrients. The mangrove plant communities are efficient in cycling plant nutrients."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Reaction of surface layer decreased to pH 3.5 after exposure to air for a period of 10 days. They are susceptible to subsidence, adverse effects from high salt levels, and have poor engineering properties. Particle-size distribution measurements are usually not reliable for tropical soils; therefore, field textures and the corresponding mid-point values of texture classes were used rather than laboratory analysis for particle sizes. Particle size distribution is difficult to determine in tropical soils because of the tendency to form water-stable aggregates.  The poor soil dispersion in laboratory analyses reflects the water-stable aggregates of clay in silt and sand-sized \"particles.\" Therefore, the soils may have large clay content but physically they behave as coarser textures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAquic conditions - Surface to 150 cm (59 inches)\nFibric soil materials - Surface to 74 cm (29 inches) (Oi horizons)\nSulfidic material - Surface to 74 cm (29 inches)\nLithologic discontinuity- 74 cm (29 inches)\nParticle-size control section- 0 to 130 cm (0 to 51 in)"
