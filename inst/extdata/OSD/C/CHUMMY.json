The A12 may be the same or lighter colored and medium to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizons have less than 50 percent base saturation.\nThe C horizons range in color from light brownish gray, light gray and pale brown with mottles ranging in color from 5YR to 5Y and 5B hues.  Textures range from loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, and may have this strata of silty clay and clay below 40 inches with or without gravels, cobbles, and stones.  The reaction in the C ranges form medium acid to very strongly acid with no reaction trend."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chummy soils occur in basins or nearly level meadows in the higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada, Cascade and Warner Mountains of California.  The sediments are from a wide range of volcanic rocks, including basalt, andesite, and rhyolite.  They are stratified but predominantly of moderately fine texture.  The soils occur at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet in a humid microthermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 45 to 60 inches, with cool, nearly rainless summers and cold wet winters.  Snow covers most of the area from November to March.  The average January temperature is 32 degrees F, the average July temperature is 63 degrees F, with an average annual temperature of 45 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 80 to 90 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly and very poorly drained; runoff is very slow; permeability is moderate.  The depth of the water table varies but is usually within 10 inches of the surface in the early summer and may drop below 5 feet in the fall.  During the winter months the soil is saturated and partly frozen."
