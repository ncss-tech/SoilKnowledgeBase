  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick and extends into the B2t horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and 15 to 35 percent in the part of the C horizon that is within the series control section.  Rock fragments are mainly of pebbles or cobbles.  Depth to calcareous material is 10 to 30 inches and depth to the ca horizon is 15 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is heavy clay loam or clay and the clay content is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  It is gravelly heavy clay loam or gravelly clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulations occur as nodules, concretions, seams and streaks."

Ashfork, Blackpipe, Chapin, Emigrant, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils have either a lithic or paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Boneek, Loma, and Rednun soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Huggins, Kube, Nunn, Richfield, Ryus, Sofia, Savo, and Torreon soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B2t horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Collbran series are on alluvial fans, valley side slopes, colluvial mountain slopes, and old terrace levels.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in thick, calcareous, transported materials derived mainly from basalt and sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."

Peninsula soils have a frigid temperature regime and lack a ca horizon, Schole and Ildefonso soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Also, Ildefonso soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and Scholle soils have a fine-loamy control section."
