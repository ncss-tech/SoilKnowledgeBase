  "OVERVIEW": "The Collbran series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvial material.  Collbran soils are on terraces, fans, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick and extends into the B2t horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and 15 to 35 percent in the part of the C horizon that is within the series control section.  Rock fragments are mainly of pebbles or cobbles.  Depth to calcareous material is 10 to 30 inches and depth to the ca horizon is 15 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is heavy clay loam or clay and the clay content is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  It is gravelly heavy clay loam or gravelly clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulations occur as nodules, concretions, seams and streaks."

The soils formed in thick, calcareous, transported materials derived mainly from basalt and sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches.
