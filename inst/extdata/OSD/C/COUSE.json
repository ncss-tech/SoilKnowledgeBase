  "OVERVIEW": "The Couse series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess with minor influence from volcanic ash and basalt.  Couse soils are on mountain plateaus and benches and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Because the argillic horizon lies wholly below 40 inches, the particle-size control section is from 10 to 40 inches in this soil.  Laboratory data are available on 2 pedons from Columbia County, Washington, Lab #S58WA-7-2-1-11 and S58WA-7-3-1-10."
