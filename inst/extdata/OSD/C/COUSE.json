The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has more than 1 percent organic matter in the upper part.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The horizon has mottles with chroma of more than 3.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in loess of 2 or more ages and a minor influence of volcanic ash and basalt.  Elevations range from 3,200 to 4,000 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

Because the argillic horizon lies wholly below 40 inches, the particle-size control section is from 10 to 40 inches in this soil.  Laboratory data are available on 2 pedons from Columbia County, Washington, Lab #S58WA-7-2-1-11 and S58WA-7-3-1-10.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
