  "OVERVIEW": "The Collide series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and reworked eolian material derived from sandstone.  Collide soils are on terraces and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Ashfork, Blackpipe, Bethune, Boquillas, Chapin, Emigrant, Leyden, Querc, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils have either a lithic or paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Boneek, Loma, and Rednun soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Huggins, Kube, Nuncho, Nunn, Richfield, Ryus, Savo, Standley, and Torreon soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizons.  Showlow soils appear to have a lithologic discontinuity.  Collbran soils have basalt gravel and have developed from alluvium from sandstone and basalt."
