  "OVERVIEW": "The Camac series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep to siltstone.  Camac soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, and residuum derived from siltstone and shale on risers of high stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
