Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 5,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
