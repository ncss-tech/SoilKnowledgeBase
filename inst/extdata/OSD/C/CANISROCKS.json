  "OVERVIEW": "The Canisrocks series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks. These soils are on mountain slopes, mountainsides, moraines, cirques, in avalanche chutes, in small mountain valleys, on small mountain benches, and on colluvial aprons. Slope is 9 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,448 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
