    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calwash (NV), Chinkle (NV), Cochora (CA), Cougarbutte (T CA), and Randsberg (CA) series. Calwash, Chinkle, Cochora, Cougarbutte, and Randsberg are shallow to paralithic contacts and are formed from colluvium over residuum. In addition, Calwash soils have 20 to 26 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalence in the fine earth fraction. Chinkle soils also are moist in some part of the moisture control section for very brief intermittent periods in summer and fall, 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms. Cochora soils also have a mean annual soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C. Cougarbutte soils also form from granitic parent materials, and are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following summer convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cutterbank soils are on eroded backslopes of uplifted lakebed sediments. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed from non-marine sediments derived from granite. Elevations are 670 to 1,200 meters. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 175 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C. The frost-free season is 200 to 270 days."
