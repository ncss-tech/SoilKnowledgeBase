  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 2 to 5 inches.  Thickness of the silty loess mantle is 2 to 13 inches.  Texture of the control section is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with greater than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content throughout the profile ranges from 0 to 30 percent subangular pebbles and cobbles.  Reaction throughout the mineral profile ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1, 2 or 3.  Color striations are common in this horizon.   Texture is silt loam or silt.  The rock fragment content is less than 5 percent gravel and cobble.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline. This horizon is very thin in many profiles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist of 1, 2, 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or silt.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.  Reaction lis neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.   Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble;  Effervescence ranges from slightly to strongly.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils are on level to gently sloping lacustrine terraces.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 to 27 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Klawasi, Mendeltna, and Tolsona soils.  Klawasi soils are on lower level lacustrine terraces and have more than 35 percent clay content.  Mendeltna soils are the permafrost counterpart of Chetaslina soils.  Mendeltna soils are on identical positions but have thicker organic mats and permafrost.  Tolsona soils are on higher elevation glacial till plains and have sandy loam textures."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is very slow to medium.  Permeability is moderate.  If the organic mat is allowed to thicken, the soil temperature will lower, the permafrost table will rise, and the soil will become impermeable."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Chetaslina soils support native vegetation of white spruce and aspen forest.  The successional state of the vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history.  The soil is used primarily for recreation and wildlife habitat.  Small areas are cleared for homesteads and grain and vegetable crops."
