    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carlito soils are on strongly sloping to extremely steep sides of mountains and canyons. Elevations range from 6,500 to 7,500 feet. The soils formed in materials mainly from shale, but there is also a sandstone influence. These soils have semiarid climate. Annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches. Annual temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees, frost free period is 120 to 160 days."
