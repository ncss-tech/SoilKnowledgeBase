  "OVERVIEW": "The Carlito series is very deep, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees.",

The soils formed in materials mainly from shale, but there is also a sandstone influence. These soils have semiarid climate. Annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches. Annual temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees, frost free period is 120 to 160 days."
