Beasley soils typically have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Bledsoe and Brashear soils are in areas with mean annual precipitation greater than 1016 mm (40 inches). Bonnell soils are more acid than moderately acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Bratton, Caneyville, Donahue, Faywood, Fredonia, and Milton soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Bucklick and Vandalia soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in a subhorizon of the argillic horizon. Eden, Heverlo, and Shrouts soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Elba and Lowell soils have rock fragments of limestone, siltstone, and shale in the lower part of the series control section. Enott soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Estate soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Haggatt soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Heitt and Mountpleasant soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Jessup soils have more than 50 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section. Kewaunee soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Markland soils have a Btk horizon in the series control section. Muncie soils are not clearly differentiated from the Cosperville soils because of overlapping properties within the series control section. Muncie soils are greater than 183 cm (6 feet) to a seasonal high water table and Cosperville soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth ranging from 91 to 183 cm (3 and 6 feet). However, redox depletions in Cosperville soils are not always present within the series control section."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 91 to 183 cm (3 to 6 feet) for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum, moderately low in the till substratum, and very high in the sandy outwash. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum, slow in the upper part of the underlying material, and rapid in the lower part."
