  "OVERVIEW": "The Chickasha series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone of Permian age.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping broad ridgetops and side slopes of convex hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).",
