Irigul soils have anustic soil moisture regime and the particle-size control section dominated by channer and flagstone shaped rock fragments. Labshaft soils have a particle-size control section dominated by gravel size rock fragmentsand a Bw horizon. Schwacheim soils have an udic bordering ustic soil moisture regime. Starley soils have a particle-size control section dominated by rock fragments of limestone origin and  secondary carbonates (Bk horizon) at depths of 13 to 38 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clamp soils are on mountains. They typically occur on shoulder, backslope, and footslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from fractured igneous rocks such as basalt. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,590 to 2,625 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
