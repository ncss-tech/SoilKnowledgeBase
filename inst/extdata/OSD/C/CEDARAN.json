  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedaran series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Cedaran soils are on mountains and hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 mm and the mean temperature is 8 degrees C.",
