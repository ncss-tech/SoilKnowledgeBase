  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 21 to 35 inches thick.  The solum ranges from 21 to 35 inches thick.  Depth to shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 61 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments consist of angular limestone and shale and range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon and 55 to 95 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 and 3 dry and moist.  It is loam with a clay content of 18 to 27 percent, and it ranges from 9 to 13 inches thick.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It ranges from gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly clay loam to clay loam.  Clay content is 35 to 40 percent.  This horizon has weak, coarse prismatic to moderate medium subangular blocky structure.  It has common to many, thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 30 percent.\nThe C or C/B horizon has value of 5 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from extremely gravelly clay loam to very gravelly silty clay loam.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline, and from slight to strong effervescence.  Rock fragment content is 60 to 80 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 15 percent."
