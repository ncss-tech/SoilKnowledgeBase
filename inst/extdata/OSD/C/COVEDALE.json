  "OVERVIEW": "The Covedale series consists of very deep, well drained soils on upland side slopes, toe slopes, and foot slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum weathered from black, fissile shale.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 44 inches and average annual temperature is 54 degrees F near the type location.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Covedale soils were proposed to fit the colluvial landforms that were previously mapped as Muse (fine).  The 4/99 revision places Covedale soils in an active CEC activity class based on estimates from the SIR and from lab data.  Rock fragment content ranges were also modified to better fit the fine-silty definition.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 7 to 67 inches (Bt/A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nLow pH and a base saturation of less than 35 percent at 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon (Ultisol Soil Order).\nDoes not have lithic, paralithic, or petroferric contact within 150 cm of the mineral soil surface and does not have a clay increase with increasing depth of 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content (Paleudult Great Group).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference sample S-94-KY-135-39-(1-6) and mineralogy sample from T-90-KY-135-68-(9) by the University of Kentucky\nMLRA: 124, 122, 125\t\tSIR: KY0205\nRevised: 10/95-SEJ,RDJ; 12/97-SEJ,DHK; 4/99-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
