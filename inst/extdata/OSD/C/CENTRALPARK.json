  "OVERVIEW": "The Centralpark series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a deep or very deep mantle of human transported natural soil materials and occurs in fill areas on anthropogenic landforms in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high but may range to moderately low if the soil has been compacted. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 1195 mm.",

Rock fragments range from 4 to 90 percent by volume with less than 10 percent (absolute) human artifacts, and the textures range from coarse sandy loam to silt loam. Consistence is very friable to firm. The firm layers are usually not root restricting and do not perch water. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly alkaline.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. It has granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable, or firm in compacted areas. Discrete pieces of ^B horizon material may be mixed in.\nThe ^B horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Structure is subangular blocky, and fine roots are generally common to many. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe ^C horizons in the transported soil have hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. These horizons are massive and may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is very friable to firm.\nThe 2Ab, 2Bwb, and 2Cb horizons, where present, have similar physical and chemical properties to corresponding master horizons listed above and in nearby undisturbed soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Centralpark soils are on nearly level to very steep anthropogenic landforms. These soils formed in human-transported soil material. Some pedons have a contact (lithologic discontinuity) with a buried natural soil below 100 cm. The human transported soil material contains less than 10 percent artifacts (e.g., plastic, glass, bricks, concrete, and/or metal). It is sourced from locally excavated soil materials that formed in till, glaciofluvial deposits, or alluvium parent materials. Rock fragments are derived mainly from metamorphic or sedimentary rocks. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Higher slopes occur when the soil is formed in unleveled mounds. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canarsie, Ebbets, Greenbelt, Laguardia, Ladyliberty, and Secaucus soils. Canarsie soils average less than 35 percent coarse fragments (i.e., combined artifacts and rock fragments) in the control section and have less than 100 centimeters of transported material.  Ebbets soils contain greater than 10 percent artifacts and less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section. Greenbelt soils average less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Ladyliberty soils are moderately well drained, dominated by sandy textures, and average greater than 35 percent coarse fragments. Well drained Laguardia and moderately well drained Secaucus soils average greater than 10 percent artifacts and greater than 35 percent coarse fragments."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium on vegetated slopes less than 8 percent, and medium to high on vegetated slopes 8 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class higher where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high, but may be moderately low if the soil has been compacted."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Depending on management, these soils may be vegetated primarily with herbaceous plants including raspberry, common reed, and mugwort or by turf grass if part of a recreation area.  Less managed areas are typically covered with native and non-native forest vegetation.  The more compacted areas support sparse populations of various grasses, annuals, and perennials that invade disturbed/stressed areas. Recreational use is unlikely in park areas where the surface is unsmoothed, or where the surface stones and boulders have not been removed."
