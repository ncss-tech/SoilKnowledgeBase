  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the contrasting texture of sand ranges from 20 to about 35 inches.  The soils have very low (less than 0.5 percent) organic matter content and content decreases regularly with depth.  Average annual soil temperature is about 76 degrees F.  There are less than 5 percent rock fragments.\nThe Cibola soils have pinkish gray, silty clay loam, moderately alkaline, calcareous Ap and C horizons abruptly overlying similar colored, moderately alkaline, calcareous fine sand IIC horizons at a depth of about 30 inches.\nThe fine-silty part of the soil has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It has few or no mottles.  The zone from 10 to 20 inches and as deep as 35 inches is silty clay loam with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and clay content of about 25 to 35 percent.  It is massive or has subangular blocky structure.  This section is strongly or violently effervescent.  An abrupt boundary marks the change to sand or loamy sand at a depth of 20 to 35 inches.\nThe IIC horizon is similar in color to above horizons or the soil is a little lower in chroma or less reddish in hue.  It is loose or soft dry.   This horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Dark stains associated with decaying woody roots are present in some pedons."

Black Butte, Glendale, Largo, and McClellan soils have mean soil temperature of less than 72 degrees F.  Holtville soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the control section.  Imperial soils have more than 35 percent clay throughout the control section.  Indio soils have less than 18 percent clay to a depth of 40 inches.  Ripley soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the control section.  Thermal soils lack sand strata in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cibola soils formed on slopes of less than 1 percent in young alluvium from a variety of rocks in the Colorado basin.   The soils occur at elevations of about 300 feet to minus 200 feet in an arid climate.  Average annual precipitation is about 4 inches, most of which falls in winter.  There are infrequent high intensity storms in summer.  The average January temperature is about 50 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 90 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 270 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Cibola soils would be classified as Alluvial soils.  Cibola soils are a part of the soils mapped as Holtville in 1922.  Holtville series has since been more narrowly defined as to texture. The activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. Last revised by the state on 6/72.
