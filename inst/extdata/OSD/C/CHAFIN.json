    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The majority of the annual precipitation falls as high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September with May and June being the driest months.  The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days and elevation is 5,600 to 7,800 feet."
