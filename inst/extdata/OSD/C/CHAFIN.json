  "OVERVIEW": "The Chafin series consists of very deep, well drained soils derived from sandstone and shale.  Chafin soils are on fan terraces on valley sides and on summits of mesas. Permeability is moderately slow to slow.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The majority of the annual precipitation falls as high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September with May and June being the driest months.
