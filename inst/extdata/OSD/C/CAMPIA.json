  "REVDATE": "02/99",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Campia series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mostly silty lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to stratification ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments typically are absent throughout the soil, but volume of gravel and cobbles ranges up to 3 percent in some pedons.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Free carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.\nCampia soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon has thin strata of silt, loam. very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand or fine sand.\nTypically the C horizon is silt loam with thin strata of coarser texture.  It has color and stratification like the Bt horizon described above."

Otterholt and Wickware soils do not have stratification in the lower part of the series control section.  Anigon soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Crystal Lake and Spencer soils have redox features and a water table within a depth of 40 inches."
