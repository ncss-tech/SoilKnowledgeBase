  "OVERVIEW": "The Coneward series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and alluvial deposits from extrusive igneous rocks.  These soils are on lava plateaus and hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
