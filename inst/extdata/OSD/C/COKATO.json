The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon as much as 3 inches thick.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It has thin to moderately thick coatings of very fine sand or silt that are light brownish gray or light gray when dry. Clay films are few to common. The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bt horizon commonly is clay loam or loam but includes subhorizons of sandy clay loam.
