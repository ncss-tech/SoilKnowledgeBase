  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chippewa Harbor series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock. These soils are on ground moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
