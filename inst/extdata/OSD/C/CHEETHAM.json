Similar series include Catilla, Depcor, Fetzer, Hockley, Katy, Landman, Milby, Monaville, Robco, Segno, Styx, and Tremona.  Wockley soils have surface horizons finer than loamy sand.  Katy soils have fine sandy loam surface layers less than 20 inches thick, and do not have significant accumulations of plinthite within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Catilla and Landman soils have sandy surface layers greater than 40 inches thick.  Depcor and Monaville soils do not have gray colors related to wetness within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Fetzer soils contain less than 5 percent plinthite.  Hockley and Segno soils have fine sandy loam surface layers. Milby soils are in the hyperthermic temperature regime.  Robco, Styx and Tremona soils are in the ustic moisture regime.  In addition, Tremona soils have a clayey particle-size control section."
