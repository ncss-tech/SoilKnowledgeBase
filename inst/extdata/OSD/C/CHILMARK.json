  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 44 inches.  Rock fragment content is usually less than 5 percent, but ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loamy sand. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky, and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is massive or has subangular or angular blocky structure and is friable or very friable.  The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It commonly is silty clay loam and averages less than 35 percent clay, but in undisturbed pedons consists of poorly mixed or folded thin strata (1/4 inch to 6 inches thick) of sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, and clay.  The 2Bt horizon is massive or it has weak prismatic structure that parts to weak blocky structure.  Consistence varying within strata is firm to extremely firm, sticky to very sticky, and plastic to very plastic.\nThe 2C horizon has the same colors, textures and consistence as the 2Bt horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Soils in the same family include the Hassler and  Roselle series.  Hassler soils (tentative) are deep to granite bedrock and formed in colluvium and residuum on mountain ridges in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A).  Roselle soils (tentative) formed in colluvium and residuum from granite on terraces and footslopes in mountain basins in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A).\nBirdsboro and Brumbaugh soils are in a closely related family.  Birdsboro soils do not have sandy loam subhorizons in the B horizon.  Brumbaugh soils (tentative) formed in colluvium and rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 50 percent in individual horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chilmark soils are gently sloping to moderately steep soils on landscapes that are very close to the bases of terminal moraines and on gently sloping or undulating lower parts of the moraines.  Slope ranges from 3 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in a loamy or sandy aeolian mantle and the underlying ice-thrusted fine or moderately fine coastal plain sediments dominated by poorly mixed tertiary clays.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 180 to more than 200 days.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Cation-exchange activity class is presumed from a review of data for similar soils.  Changes in competing series may result from updates in classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 27 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n3.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 27 to 36 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons).\n4.  Fine-loamy feature - the zone from 27 to 36 inches has more than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand, including gravel, and clay content averages about 22 percent (Bt and 2Bt horizons).\n5. Oxyaquic feature - presence of a saturated layer at 31 inches (2Bt horizon) for more than 1 month most years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
