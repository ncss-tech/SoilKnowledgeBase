  "OVERVIEW": "The Coffeen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains, low terraces or benches, toe slopes, and alluvial fans. They formed in silty alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches in thickness. The particle-size control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3. Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bw or Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have thin coatings with color value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2. Other pedons have uncoated sand grains or clay depletions on the faces of the peds. Texture typically is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Some pedons have thin lenses of loam or sandy loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, or is stratified silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Clay content ranges from 5 to 15 percent and sand content ranges from 15 to 65 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have a buried soil below a depth of 50 inches."

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, frost free period ranges from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 340 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Birds soils are on lower lying parts of the flood plains; the well drained Drury soils are on higher or steeper foot slopes; and the well drained Haymond soils are on natural levees near the stream channels or on parts of flood plains that have better natural drainage. Littleton soils are cumulic and are on slightly higher foot slopes, terraces, or alluvial fans. The well drained Raddle soils are on slightly higher foot slopes and stream terraces. The well drained Worthen soils are cumulic and are on higher foot slopes and stream terraces nearby."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the solum and moderately high to very high (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers/sec) in the substratum.   These soils have an intermittent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2 feet below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. These soils are also subject to rare or common flooding for brief periods in the spring."
