  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cetrepas soils are on backslopes of mountains and hills. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 3,000 to 5,600 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert.. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, the mean annual temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
