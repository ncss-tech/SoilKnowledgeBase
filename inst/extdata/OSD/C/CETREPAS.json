  "REVDATE": "07/2006",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cetrepas series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock. Cetrepas soils are on backslope of mountains and hills. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
