Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1,092 mm (29 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 13 degrees C (42 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 220 days. Elevation is 130 to 400 meters (427 to 1,312 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Algansee, Cohoctah, Landes, and Shoals soils. The Algansee soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Ceresco soils and do not have a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Cohoctah soils and the well drained Landes soils form a drainage sequence with Ceresco soils. The Shoals soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Ceresco soils and have more clay in the B horizon."
