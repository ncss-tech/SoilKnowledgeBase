  "OVERVIEW": "The Ceresco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 13 degrees C (42 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 220 days. Elevation is 130 to 400 meters (427 to 1,312 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Cohoctah soils and the well drained Landes soils form a drainage sequence with Ceresco soils. The Shoals soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Ceresco soils and have more clay in the B horizon."
