Luppino soils are 20 to 30 inches percent sand coarser than very fine sand within the Bt horizon. Siscab soils have 18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Wedekind soils have 18 to 27 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent rock fragments, and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand within the particle-size control section."
