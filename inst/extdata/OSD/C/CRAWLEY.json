  "OVERVIEW": "The Crawley series consists of shallow, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from silty lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
