The soil is saturated to within 25 to 40 inches of the surface during the spring. The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 degrees to 50 degrees F, and usually the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F, from about March 15 and above 47 degrees F. from about April 1 to November 1. The soils are medium acid to neutral and become less acid with depth. The base saturation exceeds 75 percent in all parts to a depth of 30 inches or more.\nThe A horizon is gray, dark gray, grayish brown or dark grayish brown (lOYR) dry. Chroma is 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe B2t horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, brown or dark brown in lOYR hue. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam, and has 27 to 35 percent clay. Rock fragments mostly gravel make up 15 to 24 percent of the volume.\nThe C horizon may be similar in texture to the B2t horizon or it may be unrelated."

They formed in alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is cool semiarid with moist cold winters and warm dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is 28 degrees F., average July temperature is 69 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 80 to 90 days."
