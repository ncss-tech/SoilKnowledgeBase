  "OVERVIEW": "The Click series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from granite of pre-Cambrian age. These gently sloping and moderately sloping soils are on shoulders and summits of ridges and hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in).",

Other grasses include sideoats grama, yellow Indiangrass, sandhill lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, fringeleaf paspalum, pinhole bluestem, vine mesquite and purpletop tridens. The dominant forbs include orange zexmenia, sagewort, snoutbean, and heath aster. The woody plants include post oak, blackjack oak and live oak. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as mesquite, whitebrush, yucca, Ashe juniper, gummy lovegrass, Texas grama, prairie coneflower, and basin sneezeweed, invade or increase on the ecological site."
