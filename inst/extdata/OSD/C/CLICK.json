The potential plant community is an open savannah of post oak, blackjack oak, and live oak with mid and tall grasses in thin stands. The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other grasses include sideoats grama, yellow Indiangrass, sandhill lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, fringeleaf paspalum, pinhole bluestem, vine mesquite and purpletop tridens. The dominant forbs include orange zexmenia, sagewort, snoutbean, and heath aster. The woody plants include post oak, blackjack oak and live oak. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as mesquite, whitebrush, yucca, Ashe juniper, gummy lovegrass, Texas grama, prairie coneflower, and basin sneezeweed, invade or increase on the ecological site."
