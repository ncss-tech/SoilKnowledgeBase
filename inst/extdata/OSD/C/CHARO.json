  "OVERVIEW": "The Charo series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in windblown sediments over basalt.  Charo soils are on ridges, hilltops, and mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
