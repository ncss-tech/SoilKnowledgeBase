  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Casebeer soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash derived from dacite and residuum derived from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,700 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 56 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Devaul soils are loamy-skeletal, deep to paralithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons.  Dranket soils are fine, moderately deep to thin duripans over lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons.  Norcross soils are clayey, shallow to thin duripans over lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons.  Pankeybasin soils are fine, moderately deep to thick duripans, have mollic epipedons, and have argillic horizons with abrupt increases in clay content."
