  "OVERVIEW": "The Chatburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in silty alluvium with some loess influence.  They are on coalesced fan terraces and valley floors.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
