Sample\n#S82ID-031:  The SAR exceeds 13 in the lower part of the argillic, but\ndoes not qualify for a natric because it lacks prismatic structure or\ntongues of E material.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 28 cm (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 28 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Btz2\nhorizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 48 to 127 cm (Bkz1, Bkz2, and Bkz3\nhorizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 28 to 48 cm (Bt1 and\nBtz2).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
