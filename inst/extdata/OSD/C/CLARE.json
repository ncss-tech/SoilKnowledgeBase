The poorly drained Drummer soils are in slight depressions or lower parts of the landform. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton, Elburn, and Millbrook soils are on slightly lower lying landform positions.

The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.
