  "OVERVIEW": "The Culleoka series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soils formed in colluvium or residuum from siltstone or interbedded shale, limestone, siltstone, and fine grained sandstone.  Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 1205 millmeters and mean annual air temperature is about 12.6 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to lithic bedrock of dominantly siltstone or fine grained sandstone is 50 to 100 centimeters.  Content of flagstones and channers range from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon, 10 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 25 to 80 percent in the BC and C horizons. Reaction ranges from moderately to strongly acid in the solum and strongly to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin BC or C horizon with colors in shades of brown, olive, or gray. The lower chroma colors are derived from the parent material. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay."

Cateache and Oatlands soils allow hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizons. Frondorf soils have less than 5 percent coarse fragments in the upper sola.  Loudonville soils have have glacial influences in the rock fragment fraction. Spriggs soils have paralithic contact and formed over mafic bedrock.  All the other series are greater than 100 centimeters to bedrock."
