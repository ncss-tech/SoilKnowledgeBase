  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons are calcareous.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons have a thin A horizon in hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 that is due to the color of the uncoated sand grains in the lower part of the C horizon. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Some pedons have loamy lenses or thin layers of very fine sandy loam or silt loam below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assateague, Buncombe, Malden and Tarboro series in the same family. Assateague soils formed in sandy, beach deposits along the Atlantic sea coast. Buncombe soils formed in sediments from igneous and metamorphic rocks and contain mica. Malden and Tarboro soils have a B horizon with soil structure."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crevasse soils are on the flood plain of the Mississippi River and tributaries. These level to gently sloping soils formed in sandy, splays mainly along levee breaks and recently deposited sediments on point bars along the main channel of the Mississippi River and tributaries. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 56 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beulah, Bruno, Commerce, and Robinsonville series and Riverwash. The somewhat excessively drained Beulah and well drained Robinsonville soils are on the lower slopes of natural levees and on level to undulating flood plain treads. They are in coarse-loamy families. Bruno soils are in natural levee positions and contain strata of finer sediments. The somewhat poorly drained Commerce soils are on flood plain treads lower in the landscape and are in a fine-silty family. Riverwash is the unvegetated sand bars in the main channel of the river."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; negligible rate of runoff; rapid permeability. These soils are typically flooded when in the point bar positions and protected in levee breech positions. The water table typically fluctuates between a depth of 3.5 to 6 feet in the wet season during winter and early in spring, however it is also strongly influenced by river levels and will be higher when the river level is up."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas that are protected from flooding are cleared and used for growing pasture and hay. Natural vegetation is cottonwood, elm, hackberry, pecan, sycamore, and willow."
