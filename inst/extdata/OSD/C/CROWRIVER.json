  "OVERVIEW": "The Crowriver series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy till. These soils are on nearly level to slightly convex positions on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
