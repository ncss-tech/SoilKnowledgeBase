Battlerock soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR. Jocity soils do not have layers with high amounts of gypsum crystals.  Binton, Boysen, Lostwells, and Youngston soils have soil temperatures of 47 to 50 degrees F. and have a higher spring rainfall component.  Toddler soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section from July - September."
