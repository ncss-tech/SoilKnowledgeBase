  "OVERVIEW": "The Colval series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff and limestone over lacustrine deposits derived mainly from welded tuff and limestone. Colval soils are on basin floors. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
