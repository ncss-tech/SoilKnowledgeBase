Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  In some pedons, there is some mixing of Ap material in the upper part.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon consists of highly weathered and partially weathered volcanic rock.  In some pedons, there is tonguing of Bw material.\nThe R horizon consists of hard consolidated volcanic rock that is rippable by heavy machinery."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Callabo soils are on side slopes of strongly dissected uplands.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  They formed in moderately fine-textured residuum that weathered from basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 50 inches and the average annual temperature is 75 to 80 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Jacana, Juana Diaz, and Llanos soils.  Jacana soils are on lower positions, are Mollisols, and have cracks when dry.  Juana Diaz soils are on similar positions, have less clay in the subsoil, and are shallow to weathered sandstone.  Llanos soils are on lower terrace positions, are very deep, and are Vertisols."
