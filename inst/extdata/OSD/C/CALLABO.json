  "OVERVIEW": "The Callabo series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on strongly dissected uplands.  They formed in moderately fine-textured residuum that weathered from basic volcanic rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.",

Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  In some pedons, there is some mixing of Ap material in the upper part.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon consists of highly weathered and partially weathered volcanic rock.  In some pedons, there is tonguing of Bw material.\nThe R horizon consists of hard consolidated volcanic rock that is rippable by heavy machinery."

They formed in moderately fine-textured residuum that weathered from basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 50 inches and the average annual temperature is 75 to 80 degrees F."

Juana Diaz soils are on similar positions, have less clay in the subsoil, and are shallow to weathered sandstone.  Llanos soils are on lower terrace positions, are very deep, and are Vertisols."
