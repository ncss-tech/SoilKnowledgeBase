Soft weathered sandstone occurs at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 39 to 42 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 56 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days during late summer.  Rock fragments consists of rounded pebbles and cobbles, and range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 30 percent in the E horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the Bt horizon and 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It ranges from loam or cobbly loam to cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dominant hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It ranges from silty clay loam to clay loam.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral to medium acid.\nThe C horizon has dominant hue of 2.5Y or 5Y (10YR in parts of some pedons), value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It ranges from silt loam to loam, gravelly loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon ranges from noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and is medium acid to neutral."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from sandstone.  The climate is humid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 40 to 75 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnositc horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic Epipedon:\nArgillic Horizon:\nParalithic Contact:\nThe depth class was narrowed from deep and very deep, to only deep (40 to 60 inches), prior to 2000.  The bedrock contact was changed in 2017 from \"R\" to \"Cr\" after researching the published manuscripts of Morgan Area, UT and Carbon Area, UT.  In both manuscripts, the bedrock was described as soft and weathered, and the soil features table listed soft and rippable bedrock.  This is more consistent with Cr material.\nThe classification of the series when first established was fine-loamy, mixed Argic Cryoborolls.\nIt was later changed to Pachic  Argicryolls because the typical profile does marginally qualify as Pachic.  However, the range in characteristics specifically describes a mollic epipedon with a thickness range less than 16 inches (40cm).  This needs to be resolved in the future, either by finding a new typical profile, or by slightly reducing the current depths of this profile to support non-pachic, which I believe was the intent.
