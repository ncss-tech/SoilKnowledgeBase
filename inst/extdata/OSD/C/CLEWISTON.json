  "OVERVIEW": "MLRA(s): 155\nMLRA Soil Survey Regional Office (SSRO) Responsible: Auburn, Alabama\nDepth Class: Moderatley deep\nDrainage Class: Very poorly drained\nSaturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  High to very high\nIndex Surface Runoff: Negligible\nParent Material: Marine sandy sediments over limestone bedrock.\nSlope: 0 to 1 percent\nElevation: 0.3 to 3 meters (1 to 10 feet)\nMean Annual Air Temperature: 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)\nMean Annual Precipitation: 127 centimeters (50 inches)\nThe Clewiston series consists of moderately deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in a thin layer of organic material and marine sandy sediments over limestone bedrock. Clewiston soils are on fresh water marshes, swamps, and low broad flats on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1270 millimeters (50 inches).",

Plantation soils were established in Broward County and is now classified as isohyperthermic.
