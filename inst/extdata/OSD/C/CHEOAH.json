  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 59 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. These soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part. The portion of the profile affected by soil creep is 40 inches or less and dependent on the length, steepness, and shape of the side slope. The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid in the A horizon, and ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the other horizons. Content of mica flakes is few to common throughout but may range to many in horizons immediately above the paralithic contact.  Content of rock fragments, dominantly channers and/or flagstones, is less than 35 percent by volume throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nAn AB or BA horizon is present in some pedons. They have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures are the same as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon, and BC or CB horizon where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon where present, is similar in color to the BC or CB horizon, or is varigated in shades of red, brown, yellow. It is saprolite weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks. It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, weakly to strongly cemented, low-grade metasedimentary rock, moderate or high excavation difficulty, few fine and medium roots in cracks that are spaced more than 4 inches apart."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cheoah soils are on strongly sloping to very steep cool, north- to east-facing ridges and side slopes and those shaded by higher mountains in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). Elevation ranges from about 1800 to 4800 feet. Slope is commonly between 30 and 80 percent but ranges from 8 to 95 percent. These soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone which is often interbedded with phyllite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 80 inches."

Brasstown, Cataska, Junaluska, Soco, Sylco, and Tsali soils are all typically in a warmer setting such as ridges, hill slopes, and south- to west-facing mountain slopes, and have ochric epipedons. Snowbird soils have an argillic horizon. Spivey soils formed in colluvium and are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was formerly included with the Burton and Porters series. However, Burton is frigid and has bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Both formed in residuum weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, and mica gneiss and contain fragments of those rocks.\nThe 1/97 revision placed Cheoah soils in a fine-loamy particle-size class. This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Laboratory PSA (pipette method) and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy. Fine-loamy particle-size class placement is based on the presence of amorphous (non-crystalline) clay-size material associated with the relatively high organic matter content found in these soils. Although field estimates, laboratory measurements, and calculated values may vary, clay content in the particle-size control section is generally less than 25 percent. Although Cheoah soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nThe 10/07 revision reflects the movement of the typical pedon from Graham County, NC to Jackson County, NC.\nRevised 02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - The zone from the mineral soil surface to 15 inches (A and AB horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 15 to 39 inches below the surface (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons).\nParalithic contact - The contact at 56 inches below the surface (the upper boundary of the Cr horizon).\nCharacterization data are available from the NSSC Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE S91NC-021-008 and  85NC-075-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
