  "OVERVIEW": "The Caliza series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  Caliza soils occur on alluvial fans or river deposits of Pleistocene age and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Eastland, Niava, Shelley, and Tonopah soils are in the Mohave Desert and are mostly in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Redo soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a higher rainfall component."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Caliza soils formed in gravelly alluvial fan, fan piedmonts or river deposits of Pleistocene age.  Commonly, the materials have been strongly dissected, and narrow ridges are prominent.  Longitudinal slopes along the ridges range from about 1 to 5 percent; ridge sides slope from about 5 to 40 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1700 to 5300 feet.  At the type location the climate is arid, continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches with a marked summer maximum.  The mean annual air temperature is 58 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 250 days."

Berino soils are nongravelly and have argillic horizons.  Canutio soils do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons and have very gravelly sandy loam textures in the control section.  Delnorte soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Stagecoach soils are loamy-skeletal."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nUpdated competing series section 3/18/08, CEM"
