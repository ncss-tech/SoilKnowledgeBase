All of these soils except Nataga and Nizina have mean annual soil temperature above 34 degrees F.  Alflack, Ragamuffin, and Stecum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Canlodore soils have E horizons. Castlepeak soils do not have O horizons. Cryomont, Obscurity, and Studebaker soils have volcanic ash, glass, or glass aggregates in the control section. Nataga and Nizina soils do not have substantial mica content in the control section."
