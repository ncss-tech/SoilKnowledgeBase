The mean annual precipitation typically is 1000 to 1500 mm in MLRA 2 and 750 to 1500 mm in MLRA 5. The frost-free period generally is 165 to 210 days in MLRA 2. Update projects have been proposed to determine whether the concepts of the Conser series should extend into MLRA 5.\n8/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; some involved an update of competing series.
