    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,000 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Mox soils have higher organic carbon accumulation in the Bs horizons and form on the most stable portions of bedrock benches and Pleistocene moraines.  Noca soils lack strong spodic horizons and form on slightly less stable portions of all the same landforms.  Spickard soils lack albic or spodic horizons and form on younger portions of debris aprons and valley walls."
