  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 65 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 inches to more than 100 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 15 to 36 inches. Rock fragments, mainly channers, flagstones, and gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, and from 10 to 40 percent below in the 2Bx and 2C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular and consistence is very friable or friable.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nSome unplowed pedons have an A horizon underlain with thin E and Bs horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Redoximorphic features may or may not be present in this horizon Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Structure is granular or subangular blocky, and consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3, with or without faint or distinct redoximorphic features. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silty loam. It is massive, or it has platy or subangular blocky structure, and consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin Bx horizon just above the 2Bx horizon, with hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4, with or without faint or distinct redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam, and contains 10 to 27 percent clay. Primary structure is moderate or strong prismatic, and consistence is firm or very firm, and brittle. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4, with few or common redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam, and contains 10 to 27 percent clay. Primary structure is moderate or strong prismatic, and consistence is firm or very firm, and brittle. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C or 2Cd horizon has the same range in color and texture as the Bx horizon except some pedons may have silty clay loam or sandy loam below 40 inches.  The horizon is massive and may have has plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Some pedons exhibit densic properties.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Amboy and Williamson series are in the same family. Amboy and Williamson soils developed in very deep silty lacustrine deposits and lack rock fragments in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Bath, Mardin, Lackawanna, and Wellsboro are similar soils in a related family. These soils lack the silty surficial mantle and have a coarse-loamy particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Canaseraga soils formed in silt-mantled till deposits. They are mainly on lower slopes of large valleys, but locally on moraines that cover the valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The underlying till is from siltstone, shale, and sandstone and contains varying amounts of limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Dalton soils are somewhat poorly drained Catena associates. The competing Bath, Mardin, Lackawanna, and Wellsboro are associated along valley sides. The moderately deep Lordstown soils are on nearby bedrock controlled landscapes. Howard and Chenango soils formed in glacial outwash on nearby terraces. Unadilla and Allard soils are on associated silt-mantle outwash terraces."
