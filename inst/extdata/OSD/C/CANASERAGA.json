  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canaseraga series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till that has a silty mantle. These soils are on lower valley sides. A dense fragipan starts at depth of 18 to 34 inches below the soil surface. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Amboy and Williamson soils developed in very deep silty lacustrine deposits and lack rock fragments in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Bath, Mardin, Lackawanna, and Wellsboro are similar soils in a related family. These soils lack the silty surficial mantle and have a coarse-loamy particle-size class."

Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The underlying till is from siltstone, shale, and sandstone and contains varying amounts of limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days."
