  "OVERVIEW": "The Candlestick series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived dominantly from sandstone.  These soils are on uplands.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.",
