Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 20 to 36 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Btk, Bk, or BCk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It consists of stratified layers.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coamo soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  They formed in sediments derived from volcanic and limestone rocks that are underlain by  materials from moderately coarse to coarse.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 80 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Amelia, Descalabrado, Jancana, and San Anton series.  Amelia soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, are clayey-skeletal, and do not have mollic epipedons.  Descalabrado soils are on higher positions and are shallow to hard volcanic rock.  Jacana soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are moderately deep.  San Anton soils are on adjacent lower flood plains and have weakly developed cambic  horizons."
