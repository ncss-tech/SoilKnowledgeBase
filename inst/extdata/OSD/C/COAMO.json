  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Coamo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on alluvial fans and terraces.  They formed in clayey sediments that weathered from volcanic and limestone rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Amelia soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, are clayey-skeletal, and do not have mollic epipedons.  Descalabrado soils are on higher positions and are shallow to hard volcanic rock.  Jacana soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are moderately deep.  San Anton soils are on adjacent lower flood plains and have weakly developed cambic  horizons."
