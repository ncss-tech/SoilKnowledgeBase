Dennis soils have thicker, dark colored surface horizons and are on summits, shoulders and side slopes.  Hepler soils are commonly flooded, have less clay in the argillic horizon and have a thicker, dark colored surface horizon.  Leanna soils have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plain steps.  Lightning soils are commonly flooded and do not have an abrupt textural change and are on floodplains.  Medoc soils have a brown subsoil within 75 cm of the soil surface and are on summits on uplands.  Opolis soils are moderately well drained and are on summits and shoulders on uplands.  Parsons soils have a mollic epipedon and are on summits on uplands and on paleoterraces.  Taloka soils have a mollic epipedon and are on paleoterraces."
