  "OVERVIEW": "The Chainlink series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone.  Chainlink soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
