Water table occurs between 20 and 36 inches where not drained. The soils are usually moist but are dry in parts of the 4 and 12 inch depth for more than 90 days, but are not dry in all parts of the 4 and 12 inch depth for 60 consecutive days in 7 out of 10 years.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and B horizons is 16 and 22 inches. Few to common medium distinct yellowish brown to strong brown mottles occur at depths of 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of less than 2.  It has 2 to 4.5 percent organic matter.  It has moderate medium granular structure in the upper portion and very weak medium prismatic or moderate fine subangular blocky structure in the lower portion.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline, and is slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe Ck horizon has 22 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam to silty clay."
