  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick and includes the AB horizon.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout but are leached a few inches in some pedons.  Organic carbon content ranges from .8 to 2.5 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with depth.  The particle size control section is typically loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Autogenetic carbonates range from 1 to 8 percent throughout with less than\n2 percent pedogenetic carbonates present in any horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  EC is less than 4 mmhos throughout.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately through strongly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has the same color and reaction range as that defined for the A horizon.  A stronger grade of structure is required and an increase in clay is common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Inconsistent pedogenetic carbonates occur in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Connerton soils are on relict terraces, fan aprons, hill toeslopes, and valley fill.  They formed in mixed, calcareous alluvium derived from redbed sediments.  Slopes are simple and range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 4,800 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 48 degrees F."

The MAST and MSST have been narrowed to better reflect the concept of a series.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
