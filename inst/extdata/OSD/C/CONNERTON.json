  "REVDATE": "05/2023",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Connerton series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium and slope alluvium derived from red sedimentary rock. Connerton soils are on relict stream terraces, fan aprons, hill toeslopes and footslopes of strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
