Boomstick and Phliss are dominated by channers. Chubard, Gabbvalley, Hooplite, Nevo, Olac, Rowel and Stewval soils are less than 36 cm to bedrock. Thike soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Richinde soils contain 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the .02 to 2 mm fraction."

These soils formed in residuum  colluviums, and slope alluvium derived from  igneous, quartzite, and metamorphic  rocks. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,340 to 2,330 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 140 days."
