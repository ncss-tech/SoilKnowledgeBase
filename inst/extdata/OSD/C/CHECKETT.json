  "OVERVIEW": "The Checkett series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from igneous, quartzite and metamorphic rocks. Checkett soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
