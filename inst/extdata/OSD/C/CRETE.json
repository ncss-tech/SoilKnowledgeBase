  "OVERVIEW": "The Crete series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. Crete soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on loess uplands and loess-covered stream terraces on river valleys in Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slopes range from 0 to 11 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

Added soil moisture and temperature statement to RIC. Added BA to RIC. Removed slightly alkaline from reaction for the Bt (upper) horizon. Removed moderately acid from reaction for the Bt (lower) horizon. Added CCE to the BC and C horizons in RIC and added statement on now being Bk horizons. Edited competing series. Changed runoff to include high. Changed saturated hydraulic conductivity from low to moderately low. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting.  Added KSSL characterization pedons that have been sampled to additional data."
