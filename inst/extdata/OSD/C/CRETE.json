    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: Mollic epipedon: 0 to 71 centimeters (0 to 28 inches) (the Ap, A, BA, and Bt1 horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 48 to 89 centimeters (19 to 35 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon).\nVertic features: The presence of linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between 0 and 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches). This was determined from lab data for Crete soils.\nSeverely eroded Crete soils no longer classify as Mollisols and need to be correlated to a new series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from pedons S60NE-18-1, S55NE-30-1, S55NE-30-2, S55NE-76-1 and S55NE-76-2 are published in Nebraska Soil Survey Investigations Report No.5.

Set range of clay content in lower Bt to 37 based on NSSL lab data.\nUpdated competing series.\nChanged permeability to Saturated Hydraulic conductivity.\n8/02/11 DJK\nChanged classification from Pachic Argiustolls to Pachic Udertic Argiustolls due to Crete meeting the requirements of being vertic based on lab data.\nAdded in or updated sand and clay content for each horizon in the RIC using lab data.\nDeleted silty clay as a texture for BC in RIC.\nAdded in slope, slope shape, and elevation for typical pedon.\nAdded quad and latitude/longitude for type location.\nUpdated competing series for new classification.\nAdded in elevation and FFD and updated the landform in geographic setting.\nUpdated geographically associated soils to meet MO5 standards (deleted Hall, Holdrege, and Wymore and updated differences of Butler, Fillmore and Hastings).\nUpdated basic formatting along with adding in metric values where needed.\n8/2012 DJK  Added depth to argillic in RIC. Added soil moisture and temperature statement to RIC. Added BA to RIC. Removed slightly alkaline from reaction for the Bt (upper) horizon. Removed moderately acid from reaction for the Bt (lower) horizon. Added CCE to the BC and C horizons in RIC and added statement on now being Bk horizons. Edited competing series. Changed runoff to include high. Changed saturated hydraulic conductivity from low to moderately low. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting.  Added KSSL characterization pedons that have been sampled to additional data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
