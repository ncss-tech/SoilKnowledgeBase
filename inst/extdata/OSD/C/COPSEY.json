    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 56 degrees F. The soils are saturated 4 to 6 months of the year and remain moist below 20 inches nearly continuously unless drained.  During the summer, the soil cracks at the surface and the cracks extend to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or N, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of less than 1.5. The amount of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 30 percent serpentinite pebbles or cobbles.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or N, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 0, 1 or 2. Rock fragments average 15 to 25 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles. Rock fragments are mostly serpentinite. In some pedons mottles are lacking in the lower part of the A horizon and upper part of the C horizon."

The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 170 days."
