  "OVERVIEW": "The Chesaning series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits overlying sandy alluvial deposits on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
