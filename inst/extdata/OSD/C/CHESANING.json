The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between September and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy material and rapid in the underlying sandy material. These soils are subject to flooding in late fall to spring where not protected."
