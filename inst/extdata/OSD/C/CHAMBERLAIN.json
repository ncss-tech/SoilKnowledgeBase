The Blaine, Bowen, Buena Vista, Elwood, Nathrop, Parkview, Winada, and Woodhall soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over a lithic or paralithic contact.  Ess and Geertsen soils have O horizons. Ezbin soils have O horizons and lack sandy-skeletal materials in the lower profile.  Hoodle, Latigo, Forner and Fourme soils lack silica coating in rock fragments.  Forsey and Teeler soils have average annual soil temperatures warmer than 40 degrees F.  Libig, Nurkey, Quander, Tahquats, Sedgway, and Zeebar soils lack sandy- skeletal materials in the lower part of the profile.  Norriston soils have 5 to 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon and lack clay films on the peds.  Packer soils are 24 to 48 inches deep over a lithic contact.  Thiel soils have mollic epipedons less than 10 inches thick and are not dry for as long as 45 consecutive days in late summer."

The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from quartzite, limestone, and granite.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches, and average annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
