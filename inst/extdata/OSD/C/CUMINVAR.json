    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cuminvar soils are on lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine material derived from volcanic rock sources with additions of volcanic ash.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 4,700 feet. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
