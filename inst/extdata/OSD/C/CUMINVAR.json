  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuminvar series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments derived from mixed volcanic rocks with additions of volcanic ash.  Cuminvar soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
