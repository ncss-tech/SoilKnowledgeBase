  "OVERVIEW": "The Coppercan series consists of shallow to weathered bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic tuff. Coppercan soils are on pediments, hills and mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches (508 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F (15.6 degrees C).",
