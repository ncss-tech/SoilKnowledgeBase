  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. CN/CAW; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "03/2005",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cardsound series consists of very shallow, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils over porous limestone bedrock on broad, very low hills on the southern extent of the Miami Ridge.  They formed in loamy marine sediments over oolitic limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 63 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil thickness and depth to limestone range from 2 to 9 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral through slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 4 or less.  Solution holes occur in the limestone in less than 20 percent of the pedons.  These solution holes are 2 to 20 inches wide and 2 to 20 inches deep.  Solution holes contain clay or clay loam.  Texture is silty clay loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cardsound soils are on broad very low hills of the Miami Ridge.  Slopes are generally 0 to 2 percent, but range up to 5 percent.  They formed in loamy marine sediments over oolitic limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 66 inches and temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Krome, Matecumbe, and Opalocka.  All of these soils are moderately well drained.  Krome soils are on similar positions, are loamy-skeletal, have been rock plowed or mechanically scarified, and planted to crops.  Matecumbe soils are organic soils in tropical hardwood hammocks.  Opalocka soils are on similar positions and have sandy marine deposits over limestone."
