Reaction ranges from neutral through slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 4 or less.  Solution holes occur in the limestone in less than 20 percent of the pedons.  These solution holes are 2 to 20 inches wide and 2 to 20 inches deep.  Solution holes contain clay or clay loam.  Texture is silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cardsound soils are on broad very low hills of the Miami Ridge.  Slopes are generally 0 to 2 percent, but range up to 5 percent.  They formed in loamy marine sediments over oolitic limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 66 inches and temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit."

Krome soils are on similar positions, are loamy-skeletal, have been rock plowed or mechanically scarified, and planted to crops.  Matecumbe soils are organic soils in tropical hardwood hammocks.  Opalocka soils are on similar positions and have sandy marine deposits over limestone."
