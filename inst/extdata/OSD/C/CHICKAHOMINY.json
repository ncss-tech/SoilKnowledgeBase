The particle-size control section has more than 30 percent silt.  Aluminum saturation on the exchange complex is commonly more than 50 percent and ranges from 10 to 25 meq/100 grams of soil.  Fine flakes of mica range from few to common in most pedons.  The soil is extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where value is 3 it is less than 6 inches thick.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have high and low chroma mottles.  The E horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BAg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma 0 through 2. High chroma mottles are in some pedons. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe EBg or BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 1OYR through 5Y or they are neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  High chroma mottles are in some pedons.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 1OYR through 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.

Bladen, Pooler, and Worsham soils have less than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section.  Bethera soils have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fraction of the particle-size control section.  Cantey, Coxville, Grady, and Rembert soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Leaf soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  Roanoke soils have a solum thickness of less than 150 cm."
