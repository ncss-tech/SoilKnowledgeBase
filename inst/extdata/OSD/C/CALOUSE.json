The control section contains 18 to 23 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 20 to 44 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or light silty clay loam and has weak or moderate subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It contains 0 to 5 percent fine and medium durinodes in some pedons."
