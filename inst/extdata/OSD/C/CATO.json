  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Due to the wavy boundary between the lower 2Bt horizon and the underlying tilted bedrock, it is extremely variable within short distances.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A, and BA horizons, where present, and from strongly acid to extremely acid in the Bt and 2Bt horizons.  Sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the A, BA, and Bt horizons.  Sandstone and shale fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from the 10 to 60 percent by volume in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of  4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR , value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8 and iron accumulations and depletions in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly, or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3Cr horizon is soft, weathered, shale bedrock in various shades of black, olive, gray, brown, red and yellow with seams of soil material making up less than 10 percent of horizon. The beds have a dip of more than 20 degrees from horizontal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cato soils are on level to gently sloping toeslopes and valley floors within valleys of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from nearby hillsides which was deposited on tilted, fractured, and folded shale bedrock of the Atoka formation.  Typically, each pedon has a paleosol directly over the shale bedrock with similar but younger sediments over the paleosol.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 56 inches  and the mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F."

The Littlefir, Pirum and Purdham soils are on slightly higher landscapes and are residual soils.  The Psyam soils are on similar landscapes but are greater than 60 inches to shale bedrock.  The Maumelle soils are on lower landscapes and are very poorly drained.  The Olmstead soils are on slightly lower landscapes and are somewhat poorly drained."
