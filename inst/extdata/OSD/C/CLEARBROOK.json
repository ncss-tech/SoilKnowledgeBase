  "REVDATE": "07/2003",
  "STATES": "PA,VA,WV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clearbrook Series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in material weathered from acid gray shale and sandstone. They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

Rock fragments of shale range from 10 to 60 percent in the A horizon, 20 to 70 percent in individual horizons of the Bt and Btg horizons, and from 50 to 90 percent in the C horizon. Reaction throughout the soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.

Slopes are commonly 2 to 7 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in residuum from acid shale and sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 57 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 42 inches. Growing season ranges from 155 to 200 days."

The Berks and Weikert soils do not have iron depletions and are on shoulders and sideslopes above and below the Clearbrook positions. The Weikert soils are also less than 20 inches to a lithic contact. Blairton soils occur on similar landscape positions and have fewer rock fragments throughout the soil."
