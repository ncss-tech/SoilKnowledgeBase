    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the Oa horizon, from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the A, E, and Btg horizons, and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the BCg and Cg horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is composed of fibric, hemic, or sapric materials.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg part of the Btg/E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  The E part of the Btg/E is composed of tongues of sandy material extending into the Btg horizon and having hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron and organic matter accumulation in shades of yellow and brown range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow and brown range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Btg horizon.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Common fine and medium soft to hard fragments of carbonatic material in shades of gray range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with lenses of sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 5Y to 5G, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canova soils are in large depressional areas, fresh water swamps, and marshes.  Slopes are 1 percent or less.  They formed in moderately thick beds of loamy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

Chobee, Floridana, and Manatee soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, do not have Histic epipedons, and are Mollisols.  In addition, Floridana soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Manatee soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  The very poorly drained or poorly drained Felda and Valkaria soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and do not have Histic epipedons.  In addition, Felda soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Valkaria soils have weakly expressed spodic horizons and are sandy throughout.   Micco, Terra Ceia, and Tomoka soils are on similar positions and are Histosols.  In addition, Micco soils have an organic layer 16 to 40 inches in thickness, Terra Ceia soils are organic throughout the profile, and Tomoka soils have organic layers 16 to 45 inches in thickness.  The poorly drained Winder soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and do not have a Histic epipedon."

In its natural state, the soil is flooded for 3 to 6 months during most years.\nThese soils were formerly a part of the Felda series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
