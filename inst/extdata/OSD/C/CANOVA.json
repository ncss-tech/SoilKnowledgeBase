  "OVERVIEW": "The Canova series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils in depressions and fresh water swamps and marshes.  They formed in loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

Chobee, Floridana, and Manatee soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, do not have Histic epipedons, and are Mollisols.  In addition, Floridana soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Manatee soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  The very poorly drained or poorly drained Felda and Valkaria soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and do not have Histic epipedons.  In addition, Felda soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Valkaria soils have weakly expressed spodic horizons and are sandy throughout.   Micco, Terra Ceia, and Tomoka soils are on similar positions and are Histosols.  In addition, Micco soils have an organic layer 16 to 40 inches in thickness, Terra Ceia soils are organic throughout the profile, and Tomoka soils have organic layers 16 to 45 inches in thickness.  The poorly drained Winder soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and do not have a Histic epipedon."

In its natural state, the soil is flooded for 3 to 6 months during most years.\nThese soils were formerly a part of the Felda series."
