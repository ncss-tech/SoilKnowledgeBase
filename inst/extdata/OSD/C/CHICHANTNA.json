  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Strata of mineral material, including volcanic ash, occur throughout the profile.  Combined thickness of the various mineral strata is less than 12 inches.  The subsurface tier is dominantly highly decomposed sphagnum moss peat with less than 15 percent fibers after rubbing.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  The pH (0.01M CaCl2) of the organic materials is 4.5 or greater within some part of the control section.\nThe organic materials have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe mineral strata have hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 6; and chroma moist from 1 to 4."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bowstring and Tyonek series in the same family and the Nikolai series.  Bowstring soils do not have strata of volcanic ash.  Nikolai soils have a mineral layer thicker than 12 inches within the control section.  Tyonek soils are formed in decomposing forest and grassland litter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chichantna soils are in depressional areas within upland till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in peat deposits interlayered with ash-influenced loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 34 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches."

Chuit, Puntilla, and Strandline soils are well drained mineral soils formed in loess mantles overlying glacial till on moraines.  Kliskon soils are somewhat poorly drained mineral soils formed in loess overlying glacial till on moraines.  Starichkof soils have dominantly hemic organic material within the control section."
