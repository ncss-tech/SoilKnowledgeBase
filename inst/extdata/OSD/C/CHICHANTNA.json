  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chichantna series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils formed in peat materials interlayered with strat of ash-influenced loess.  Chichantna soils are in depressional areas on upland till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Strata of mineral material, including volcanic ash, occur throughout the profile.  Combined thickness of the various mineral strata is less than 12 inches.  The subsurface tier is dominantly highly decomposed sphagnum moss peat with less than 15 percent fibers after rubbing.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  The pH (0.01M CaCl2) of the organic materials is 4.5 or greater within some part of the control section.\nThe organic materials have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe mineral strata have hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 6; and chroma moist from 1 to 4."
