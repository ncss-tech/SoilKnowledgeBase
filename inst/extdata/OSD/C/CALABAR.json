  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soils are not moist in some part of the soil between 4 and 12 inches for a continuous period equal to more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.  No strongly contrasting textures are within 40 inches of the surface and no bedrock is within 60 inches.  The soil is calcareous and strongly or very strongly alkaline in the A and B horizons.  Hues are 10YR throughout and the chroma is 2 or more to depths greater than 40 inches.  The organic matter content is over 1 percent to depths greater than 15 inches. Color values of the A and B horizons range from 3.5 to 5 moist.  The chroma of the A and B horizons ranges from 2 to 3.  The texture of the A horizons ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam.  The structure of the B2t horizon is strong or moderate coarse or medium prismatic and strong or moderate fine or very fine subangular blocky.  The texture is a silty clay loam or clay loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and less than 35 percent clay.  The C horizon has values ranging from 4 to 5 moist.  The texture ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Calabar series occurs on gently sloping low fans and terraces at elevation of 3,800 to 5,000 feet.  The regolith consists of mixed alluvial sediments derived from old moderately fine and fine textured water laid sediments, basalt, shale, and andesite. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean July air temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean January air temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Frost occurs every month of the year."
