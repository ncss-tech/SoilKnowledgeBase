  "OVERVIEW": "The Covey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock and calcareous conglomerate. These soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
