  "OVERVIEW": "The Cinnamon Bay series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on alluvial fans and terraces.  They formed in alluvium from adjacent volcanic uplands.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
