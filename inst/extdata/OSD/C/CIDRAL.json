  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is over 60 inches and the argillic horizon is over 50 inches.  The soils are extremely acid; slightly sticky and plastic throughout.\nThe colors of the A horizons vary in hues from 7.5YR to 10YR, in values of 4 and chroma from 4 to 6.\nColors of the B2t horizons are mixed and range in hues from 10YR, 7.5YR and 2.5YR, in values and chroma of 4, 5, and 6.  In the lower B horizons yellow colors are dominant mostly in chroma of 6 or higher.  Texture of the A and B2t horizons is dominantly clay.\nThe B3 horizon varies in texture from clay loam to clay.  Structure of the B2t horizons ranges from moderate fine to medium subangular blocky.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon is less than 35 percent (by sum of cations).  Organic matter content in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon is less than 1.5 percent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cabo Rojo, Maleze, and Bajucos series in the same subgroup and the Rio Lajas, Jobos, Guanajibo and Guerrero series in the same Great Group.  The Cabo Rojo soils have darker colored horizons on values darker than 4.  The Maleza and Bejucos soils have oxidic mineralogy, in addition, the Bejucos soils are yellower and have more oxides of iron and aluminum in their profiles.  The Rio Lajas soils have coarser textured profiles and sandy surface horizons more than 20 inches thick.  The Jobos, Guanajibo and Guerrero soils have more than 5 percent nonindurated plinthite in their profiles.  The Guerrero soils have sandy surface horizons more than 20 inches thick."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cidral soils occur in gently to moderately sloping small valleys between the limestone hills with slope gradients from 2 to 12 percent.  The regolith consists of fine textured sediments of variegated colors derived from limestone and volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is more than 71.6 degrees F. and the difference between mean summer and winter temperature is less than 9 degrees F."

The Parchas soils are poorly drained.  The Colinas soils are darker, calcareous, and do not have the weathered B horizons.  The Juncal series have darker surface horizons, mildly alkaline B horizons and calcareous substrata."
