    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Columbia Taxadjunct, Llanoseco, Marvin and Parrott soils.  Columbia Taxadjunct soils are coarse-loamy and are in oxbows.  Llanoseco soils are very deep to duripan, are fine, have slickensides and cracks, have smectitic mineralogy and are in flood basins.  Marvin soils are fine, are somewhat poorly drained, are on flood plains adjacent to flood basins and are in lower positions.  Parrott soils are fine-silty, and are on flood plains in the reach of the Sacramento River that deposits mainly silt loam textured alluvium during floods."

The soils are protected by levees and are subject to occasional flooding for brief periods in December through March.  Water occasionally ponds up to 2.5 inches, (6 cm) above the surface for brief duration from December through March.  A fluctuating apparent water table can occur between 38 and 80 inches, (96 to 203 cm) or more from the soil surface from December through April."

This description is the TUD for Zamora (formerly known as Codora).  Codora is being set up again to split the use of Zamora on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Zamora should be restricted to use on alluvial fans.  This profile also represents Codora in Butte County.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from (57-11-4) reported in Soil Survey, Glenn Co.
