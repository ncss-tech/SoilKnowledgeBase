  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and Ap horizons and the upper part of the Bt horizon, and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Fragments of limestone, chert, or sandstone (surface layer only) range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and upper Bt horizon, and 0 to 35 percent immediately above limestone bedrock.\nThe A and Ap horizon have hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Severely eroded pedons can range to silty clay.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have BA or BE horizons with hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  A subhorizon of 5YR or 2.5YR is required, but 2.5YR hue throughout is not allowed. Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, and in the lower part gray is allowed.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nSome pedons have C or BC horizons with matrix and mottle colors in shades of red, brown, yellow, olive, or gray.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

All these soils except Eden, Faywood, Fredonia, Heverlo, and Milton are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.    Faywood and Eden soils formed in interbedded calcareous shale, siltstone, and limestone. Fredonia soils have hues of 2.5YR or 10R throughout the Bt horizon.  Milton and Heverlo soils formed in glacial material."

Crider, Vertrees, and Hagerstown soils have bedrock at a depth greater than 40 inches.  Frondorf soils have silt loam or silty clay loam B horizons which are underlain by acid sandstone, siltstone, or shale and are on slightly higher landscapes.  Garmon soils have greater than 35 percent fragments in the control section and lack an argillic horizon.  Newark and Nolin soils are on flood plains.  Ramsey soils have sandstone at a depth less than 20 inches, lack argillic horizons, and are on slightly higher landscapes."
