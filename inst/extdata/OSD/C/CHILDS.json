  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 45 inches or more to the bottom of the Bt horizons, and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry for more than 60 consecutive days during the summer months.\nThe A horizon colors are dry in the 10YR hue and have values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1.  Moist hue also is 10YR, values are 2 or 3 and chroma is 1.  Texture ranges from gravelly loam to cobbly loam; structure from strong granular in the A11 to structureless (massive) in the lower A horizons.  Consistence is friable to very friable and reaction is strongly acid to medium acid.  In places the A11 horizon is very thin because of erosion.\nThe Bt horizon colors are in the 10YR hue with values of 5 to 6 dry and 3 to 4 moist and with values increasing with depth.  Chromas are 1 or 2.   Texture ranges from very gravelly light clay loam to very gravelly clay loam and the horizons have weak structure or are massive.  Consistence is slightly sticky and slightly plastic and reaction is medium acid in the upper B horizons and neutral or slightly acid below.\nThe Cm horizon usually is weakly cemented but is moderately cemented in places; mottles are distinct or faint and the layer is slowly permeable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Hapgood, Snag and Windy are similar soils.  The Hapgood soils are very gravelly and cobbly, lack Bt horizons and are slightly acid.  The Snag soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control sections and the Windy soils are very stony and are underlain by bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Childs soils are on gently sloping fans around the edges of mountain meadows or in meadows that have been drained by erosion.  The alluvium is mostly outwash from basic igneous rocks.  Elevations are 4,000 to 6,000 feet and air drainage generally is slow.  The climate is humid microthermal, with mean annual precipitation of 45 to 60 inches, and with cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F, average January temperature about 32 degrees F, and average July temperature about 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
