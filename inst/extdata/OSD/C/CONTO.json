  "OVERVIEW": "The Conto series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on foothills.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
