Solum thickness and thickness of the volcanic ash and loess mantle is 7 to 14 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR and 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is ashy sandy loam or ashy silt loam.  In some pedons, at higher elevations, the upper part of the Bs has brittle, slightly hard to hard consistence and has moist hue of 2.5YR.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
