  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cliftycreek soils are on planar or convex slopes on till plains of Wisconsinan age. They are in areas of bedrock controlled topography. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till and clayey residuum overlying bedrock high in carbonates. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils are on adjacent, lower lying landform positions. The moderately well drained Miami soils are on similar positions. Milton soils have bedrock at shallower depths and are on similar or lower lying positions. Senachwine soils are formed entirely in till and are on similar positions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Cliftycreek soils were formerly mapped as Milton soils in Bartholomew County, Indiana. Closer study showed that the bedrock is deeper than originally mapped in some areas. Cliftycreek soils are anticipated to occur in adjoining counties.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 178 cm (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 3Bt6 horizons).\nLithic contact: at 178 cm (top of 3R layer).\nRepresentative data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 155541 in MO 11.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Transect data is on file at the MLRA Project Office in Indianapolis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
