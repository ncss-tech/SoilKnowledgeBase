  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowarts series consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained soils on ridge tops and side slopes on uplands of the Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) Major Land Resource Area.  They formed in loamy marine sediments.  They are Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where lime has been added.  Percent by volume of iron concretions and/or quartz gravel, 2 mm to 7 cm in diameter, ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the A and E horizons; from 0 to 10 percent in the B horizon; and from 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon.  Percent by volume of nodular plinthite ranges from 0 to 4 percent, by volume.  Silt content is less than 20 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It has the same range in texture as the A horizon.\nThe EB or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Relict and contemporary redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is less than 10 inches thick.  It has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 8; or it is multicolored in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray.  Relict and contemporary redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray range from few to many. Texture ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay.\nThe C horizon, or less commonly, a Cd horizon, has the same range in hue, value and chroma as the BC horizon.  It is layered and pocketed with fine and coarse materials.  Relict and contemporary redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray range from common to many.  Some pedons have a gray clay 2C horizon below a depth of 40 inches.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to clay."

The somewhat poorly drained Ardilla soils are on lower, less sloping positions and have fragipans.  The well drained Carnegie, Dothan and Tifton soils are on smoother, less dissected positions have more than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil.  In addition, Carnegie soils have clayey control sections.  The well drained Fuquay and Uchee soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  The moderately well drained Gilead and well drained Luverne soils are generally on lower slopes and have clayey control sections.  The well drained Orangeburg soils are on smoother landscape positions and have sola which are more than 40 inches thick."
