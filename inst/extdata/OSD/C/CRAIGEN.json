  "OVERVIEW": "The Craigen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in sandy alluvium derived from strand plain deposits of the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1473 mm (58 in).",
