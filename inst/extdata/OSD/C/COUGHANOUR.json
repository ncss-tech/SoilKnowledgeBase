These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than half the time (cumulative), unless irrigated. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 24 to 34 percent clay.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. It averages 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent pebbles."

The soils formed in old alluvium mainly from volcanic ash and loess. The climate is semiarid and the summers are dry. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F. The average frost-free season is 110 to 140 days. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches."
