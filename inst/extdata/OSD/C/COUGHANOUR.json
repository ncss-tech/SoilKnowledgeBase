  "OVERVIEW": "The Coughanour series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium mainly from loess and volcanic ash.  Coughanour soils are on old fans and low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than half the time (cumulative), unless irrigated. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 24 to 34 percent clay.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. It averages 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent pebbles."
