Elevations range from 10 to 855 meters. These soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2280 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 330 days."
