  "OVERVIEW": "The Capetown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. Capetown soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1520 milimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
