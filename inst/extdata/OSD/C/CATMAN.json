  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Catman series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Catman soils are on flood plains, upland drainageways and playas. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
