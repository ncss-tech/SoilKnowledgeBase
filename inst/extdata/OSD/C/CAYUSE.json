  "OVERVIEW": "The Cayuse series consists of deep, well drained soils,\nformed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum and\ncolluvium from andesite or basalt.  Cayuse soils are on\nmountain ridgecrests and sideslopes at 5,000 to 6,200\nfeet elevation.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  Average\nannual precipitation is about 90 inches.  Mean\nannual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
