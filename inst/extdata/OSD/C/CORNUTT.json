    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more.  The calcium/magnesium ratio is about 1 or less.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR of 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  Rock fragments average 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It averages 40 to 55 percent clay and has partially weathered fragments of rock averaging 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent pebbles."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bateman, Freezener, Jumpoff, Lettia, Manzanita, Melbourne, Munset, Napavine, Oak Grove, Oakland, Rainier, Secata and Veneta series.  All of these soils are low in magnesium.  Also, Bateman soils have a silty clay loam, or silty clay Bt horizon.  Freezener soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid in the B2t horizon and have clay loam, slity clay loam and silty clay textures.  Jumpoff soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR throughtout and are moderately well drained.  Lettia soils have more than 25 percent medium and coarse sand in the Bt horizon.  Manzabita soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days in the summer and autumn and have distinct high chroma mottles in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Melbourne soils have hue yellower than 5YR throughout and are medium acid or strongly acid.  Munset soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Napavine and Oakland soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Also, Napavine soils have an umbric epipedon and the Oakland soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Oak Grove soils have an umbric epipedon.  Rainier soils have an umbric eipipedon and are strongly acid.  Secata soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon and have hue yellower than 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Veneta soils have hue yellower than 5YR and have more than 60 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cornutt soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans of high stream terraces, have slopes of 7 to 55 percent and are at elevations of 800 to 5,000 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered from mixed ultramafic rocks high in magnesium and altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is characteriaed by cool moist winters and warm dry summers with an annual precipitation of 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 100 to 170 days."

Brockman, Dubakella, Eightlar, and Pearsoll soils have serpentinitic mineralogy.  Brockman and Eightlar soils lack and argillic horizon.  Dubakella and Pearsoll soils are skeletal.  Josephine and Speaker soils are fine-loamy.  Josephine soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Speaker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep."
