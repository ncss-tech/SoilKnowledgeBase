  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Catnapp soils are on plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed sources over residuum derived from basalt or tuff. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
