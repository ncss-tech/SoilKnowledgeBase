  "OVERVIEW": "The Chocknott series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on alluvial fans, drainageways, flood plains and stream terraces of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in alluvium from pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
