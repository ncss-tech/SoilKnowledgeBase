  "OVERVIEW": "The Capehorn series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium derived dominantly from granite, gneiss and schist, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on small valley bottoms, low stream terraces and floodplains, and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
