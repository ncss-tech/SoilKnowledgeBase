    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Capehorn soils are on level or nearly level, small valley bottoms, low stream terraces, and floodplains.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 4,200 feet.  The soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Average annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 90 days."
