  "OVERVIEW": "The Capehorn series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium derived dominantly from granite, gneiss and schist, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on small valley bottoms and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 36 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
