    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  Depth to accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 6 to about 20 inches.\nThe particle size control section is typically very fine sandy loam with clay ranging from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 10 to 50 percent, and sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is  slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. It is very fine sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay. Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 14 percent.  Bk horizons have less than a 5 percent increase in calcium carbonate equivalent over an underlying horizon."

Alice soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle size control section. Blanche and Phiferson soils are moderately deep.  Busher soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Chappell soils have a lithologic discontinuity at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Jayem and Stapleton soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Unaweep soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

The soil formed in alluvium derived from fine grained sandstone, siltstones and limestones. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring  months. The average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The average frost free period is 110 to 130 days."
