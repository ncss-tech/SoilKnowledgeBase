None of these soils except Kureb, Echaw, and Rimini have E horizons that are underlain by Bh horizons.  Alaga, Lakeland, and Wando soils do not have lower horizons with chroma 2 or less.  Alpin and Catpoint soils have lamella.  Arenosa soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Bigbee, Blanton, Chipley, and Foxworth soils have a seasonal high water table.  Blanton soils also have a Bt horizon.   Kureb, Echaw, and Rimini soils have Bh horizons at less than 80 inches from the surface."

The soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and freeze-free season ranges from 240 to 250 days."
