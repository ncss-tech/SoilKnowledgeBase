None of these soils except Kureb, Echaw, and Rimini have E horizons that are underlain by Bh horizons.  Alaga, Lakeland, and Wando soils do not have lower horizons with chroma 2 or less.  Alpin and Catpoint soils have lamella.  Arenosa soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Bigbee, Blanton, Chipley, and Foxworth soils have a seasonal high water table.  Blanton soils also have a Bt horizon.   Kureb, Echaw, and Rimini soils have Bh horizons at less than 80 inches from the surface."
