Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with about 55 percent falling between April and September. July, August and September are the wettest months, with April, May and June being the driest. Elevation is 4,800 to 6,600 feet. The freeze-free period is 100 to 160 days."
