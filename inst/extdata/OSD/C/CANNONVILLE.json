  "OVERVIEW": "The Cannonville series consists of very shallow to shallow to shale, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residuum from Tropic shale on ridges and hillsides. Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",
