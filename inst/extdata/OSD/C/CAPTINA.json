  "OVERVIEW": "The Captina series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands and old stream terraces of the Ozark Highlands.  They formed in a thin mantle of silty material and the underlying colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone, cherty limestone and dolomite, or siltstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 45 inches.",
