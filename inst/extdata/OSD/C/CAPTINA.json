    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to consolidated bedrock is over 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from l6 to 38 inches. Chert fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume above the fragipan.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In uncultivated areas the A horizon is 2 to 5 inches thick and has hue of l0YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid. It may be neutral where limed.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of l0YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3, or value of 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  In some pedons, it has mottles in shades of gray, brown or red in the lower part.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, or with hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, and mottled in shades of gray and red, or it is a mottled horizon in shades of gray, brown, and red.  Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  The 2Btx horizon has 0 to 70 percent chert fragments with the most fragments typically being in the lower part. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon below the fragipan is variable in short distances.  Hue ranges from l0R to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 4 to 8, or it is a mottled horizon in shades of red, gray, and brown.  Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.  Chert content is extremely variable over short distances ranging from as low as 30 percent to as much as 90 percent in discontinuous beds. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Captina soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands and old stream terraces on the Ozark Highlands and other areas. They formed in a thin mantle of silty material and the underlying colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone, cherty limestone and dolomite, and siltstone bedrock. Slopes range from l to l5 percent, but typically are less than 8 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F,, and average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches."

Agnos, Doniphan, and Gassville soils are on adjacent side slopes, have a clayey textural family, and do not have a fragipan. Clarksville and Noark soils are on side slopes, have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and do not have a fragipan.  Gepp soils are on side slopes, have a very-fine textural family, and do not have a fragipan.  Nixa soils are on ridgetops and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
