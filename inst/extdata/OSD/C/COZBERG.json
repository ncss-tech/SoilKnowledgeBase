  "OVERVIEW": "The Cozberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glaciofluvial deposits or eolian deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, hills and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
