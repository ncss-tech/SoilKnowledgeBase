Chimayo soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F. and are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a lower rainfall component.  Hailstone soils have a lower soil temperature and a higher rainfall component and they formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff. Telephone soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 56 degrees F."

They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from granite, gneiss and schist.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 55 to 57 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 160 to 180 days."
