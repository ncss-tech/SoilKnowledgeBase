  "OVERVIEW": "The Colskel series consists of well drained, very shallow to shallow soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone.  Colskel soils are on steep hillslopes on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
