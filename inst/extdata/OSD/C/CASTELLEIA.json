  "OVERVIEW": "The Castelleia series consists of well drained soils formed in thick noncalcareous, stony medium to moderately fine materials weathered locally from quartz, latite, or similar rocks.  Castelleia soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans or hillsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Typically, Castelleia soils have very dark brown, very friable, granular A1 horizons, dark grayish brown A2 horizons, grayish brown transitional A&B horizons having subangular blocky structure, and dark brown clay loam B2t horizons.",

Ansel and Lick soils lack A&B horizons more than 3 inches thick.  Jacquette soils have sola thicker than 55 inches.  Edloe, Limber, Sapphire, Schofield, Shule, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, Polvadera, and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Hierro and Uinta soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Tahoma soils lack A2 and A&B horizons, and have B2t horizons thicker than 25 inches.  Trapper and Whitefish soils are calcareous above depth of 40 inches."
