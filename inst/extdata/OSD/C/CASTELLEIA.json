Ansel, Jacquette, Peeler, and Swifton soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in any part of the upper 40 inches of the profile.  Ansel and Lick soils lack A&B horizons more than 3 inches thick.  Jacquette soils have sola thicker than 55 inches.  Edloe, Limber, Sapphire, Schofield, Shule, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, Polvadera, and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Hierro and Uinta soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Tahoma soils lack A2 and A&B horizons, and have B2t horizons thicker than 25 inches.  Trapper and Whitefish soils are calcareous above depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Castelleia soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans or hillsides.  Slopes usually range from about 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, stony medium to moderately fine materials weathered locally from quartz, latite, or similar rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."
