  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Castelleia series consists of well drained soils formed in thick noncalcareous, stony medium to moderately fine materials weathered locally from quartz, latite, or similar rocks.  Castelleia soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans or hillsides. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
