  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuate series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone.  Cuate soils are on hillslopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
