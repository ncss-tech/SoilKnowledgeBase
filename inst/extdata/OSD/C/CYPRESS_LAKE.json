Cypress Lake soils are on low broad flats, flatwoods, low rises and/or knolls, drainageways, and depressions on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 1270 millimeters (50 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F.).",
