Boca is in the isohyperthermic soil temperature regime.\nThis pedon was described before urbanization took place and will remain as an Arenic Endoaqualfs. This soil will need to be reviewed in urban land mapping for re-classification. At that time a new pedon will be needed for Cypress Lake that occurs in areas not urbanized.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nOSD User Site ID: S1978FL071009\nOSD User Pedon ID: S1978FL071009\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
