  "OVERVIEW": "The Conger series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are, moderately permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in calcareous loamy eolian deposits over alluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping ridges and divides on dissected plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
