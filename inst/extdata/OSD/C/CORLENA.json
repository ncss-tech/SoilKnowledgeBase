  "OVERVIEW": "The Corlena series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sandy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These soils are on nearly level floodplains of narrow draws. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
