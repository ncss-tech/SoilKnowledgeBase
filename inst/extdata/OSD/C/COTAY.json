  "OVERVIEW": "The Cotay series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on backslopes of mountains. Cotay soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium overlying fractured metavolcanic bedrock.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.",
