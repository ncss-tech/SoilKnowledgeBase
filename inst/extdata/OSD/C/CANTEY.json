It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Most pedons have few to many mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow throughout the Btg horizon.  The Btg horizon is sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.
