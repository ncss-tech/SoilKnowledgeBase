  "OVERVIEW": "The Campfour series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from andesite or basalt.  Campfour soils are on plateaus and hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean anuual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

The\nmean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The soil has a base saturation of 60 to 90 percent in the A and AB horizons and 50 to 75 percent throughout the Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, moist and dry,\nvalue of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 3 or 4\ndry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nIt is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR moist and 7.5YR through\n2.5YR dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent\ncobbles.  It is clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or cobbly clay\nloam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid."
