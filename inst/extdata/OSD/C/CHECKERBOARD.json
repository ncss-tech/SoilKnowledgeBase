  "OVERVIEW": "The Checkerboard series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Checkerboard soils are on ridges, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
