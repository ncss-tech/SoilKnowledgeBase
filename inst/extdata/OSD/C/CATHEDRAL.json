  "OVERVIEW": "The Cathedral series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from granite, monzonite, schist, or gneiss. These soils are on mountain slopes and hills with slopes of 2 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - from 0 to 11 inches (A and Bw horizons)\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 0 to 11 inches (A and Bw horizons)\nLithic contact - at 11 inches (top of the R layer)\nThe 1980 revision moved the type location from Gunnison County to Jefferson County (Golden Area).\nThe 12/99 revision changed the mineralogy class from mixed to paramicaceous. The assignment of paramicaceous mineralogy class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area and the high observable mica particles in the fine and medium sand fraction.\nSoils correlated to this series that have mean annual precipitation of 14 to about 16 inches are now likely outside the current series concept. Soils with this low amount of precipitation would probably have an ustic regime bordering aridic. These soils would then be in the Aridic Lithic subgroup of Haplustolls, which was added to Soil Taxonomy in 2003. Prior to 2003 these drier soils were included in the Cathedral series.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
