  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is clay loam, clay, or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The soil is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly rounded pebbles with a few cobbles.  EC is 2 to 4 mmhos.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 6.  It has 5 to 35 percent soft shale chips which break down on pretreatment.  Gypsum ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  EC is 4 to 16 mmhos.\nThe Cr is soft, platy, gypsiferous shale.  It is frequently more than 20 feet thick."

Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Elevation is 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
