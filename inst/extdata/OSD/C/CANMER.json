Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value or 4 or 5, chroma 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 and most pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow or red.

Frederick soils have more rock fragments in the A horizons that are mostly chert.  The Macedonia soils have yellower hues, and residuum from clayey shales, and cherty dolomite or cherty limestone.\nThe Baxter, Christiana, Dewey, Dunmore, Fullerton, Hagerstown, Lodi, and Waynesboro soils are in related families.  The Baxter and Hagerstown soils have base saturation more than 35 percent.  Christiana and Dunmore soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Dewey, Fullerton, and Waynesboro soils have thermic soil temperature regimes.  Lodi soils have sola less than 60 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canmer soils are on terraces, and uplands.  Topography is dominantly rolling but ranges from undulating to steep.  These soils have formed in old alluvium or unconsolidated material of sandstone, shale, and limestone origin.  They are underlain by residuum of limestone origin.  They are underlain by residuum of limestone or limestone bedrock below a depth of 5 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."
