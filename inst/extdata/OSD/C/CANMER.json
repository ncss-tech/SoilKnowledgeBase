  "OVERVIEW": "The Canmer series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability.  These soils have formed in old alluvium or unconsolidated material of sandstone, shale and limestone origin.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees and the mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches.",

They are underlain by residuum of limestone or limestone bedrock below a depth of 5 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."
