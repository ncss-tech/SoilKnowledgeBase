  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Croke series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a silty or loamy mantle of glacial lacustrine sediments overlying calcareous clayey glacial lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on glacial lake plains.  They have moderately rapid permeability in the upper mantle and slow permeability in the underlying sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  Thickness of solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches and depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sediments average less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. The 2C horizon typically averages between 40 to 55 percent clay with extreme range of 35 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  It is very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, very fine sand, loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features.  It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, very fine sand, loam or silt loam.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few to many distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It is typically silty clay or clay, but silty clay loam or clay loam is in the range.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

They formed in a 20 to 40 inch mantle of silty or loamy glaciolacustrine sediments which overlie calcareous clayey glaciolacustrine sediments.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual air temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches."

Glyndon and Wheatville soils have a calcic horizon and are on similar positions.  In addition, Glyndon soils have more than 40 inches of silty sediments."

A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 3450 for results of some laboratory analysis of a similar pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
