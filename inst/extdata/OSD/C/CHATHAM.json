  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but is typically 20 to 30 inches.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Volume of pebbles in the solum ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Volume of pebbles in the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 35 percent and volume of coarse fragments larger than 3 inches range from 20 to 60 percent.  The coarse fragments are dominantly dolomitic sandstone and limestone containing glauconite.\nThe Ap horizon or A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A, E, and Bhs horizons are dominantly fine sandy loam, but the range includes loam and sandy loam.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Pockets of gravel are common in some areas."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bangor, Becket, Berkshire, Caribou, Groveton, Macomber, Marlow, Onota, and Tunbridge series in the same family and the Kiva, Longrie, Munising, and Trenary series.  Bangor, Becket, Berkshire, Onota, Macomber, Marlow, Munising, and Tunbridge soils have more acid sola and C horizons.  In addition, Onota and Macomber soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches; and Munising soils have fragipans. Caribou soils are more acid in the upper solum.  Groveton soils have less than 10 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section.  Kiva soils have thinner sola.  Longrie soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chatham soils are on ground and end moraines of Wisconsinan age.  Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 15 percent, with some steep slopes up to 35 percent along glacial drainageways.  Chatham soils formed in loamy deposits overlying gravelly loamy sand or cobbly loamy sand.  Mean annual temperatures range from 41 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches."

Nearby in some places are the well drained Longrie, somewhat poorly drained Sundell, and poorly drained Nahma soils where limestone is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  In other places, the Summerville, Ensign, and Ruse soils are nearby where the limestone is at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  The soils underlain by limestone are on benches in adjacent glacial drainageways."
