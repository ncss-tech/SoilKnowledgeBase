The base saturation ranges from 35 to 50 percent throughout.  Between a depth of 6 to 18 inches the soil is dry in all parts from July to October, and is moist in all parts from December thru April in most years.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 6/1, 6/2, 2.5Y 5/2, 6/1 or 6/2 dry.  It is fine sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  It is medium through very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3 or 7/2.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/4, 5Y 5/3 or 6/3.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cotati soils occur on undulating to smooth terraces with slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in old sediments of weakly consolidated sandstone, siltstone, and shale, interbedded with clayey materials and conglomerates at elevations of 60 to 800 feet.  The climate has hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 20 to 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F, mean January temperature is 47 degrees F, and mean July temperature is 66 degrees F.  Frost-free season varies from 230 to 260 days."

Goldridge soils are fine-loamy and isomesic.  Steinbeck soils are fine-loamy and mesic.  Sebastopol soils are mesic and have base saturation less than 35 percent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This is a classification change from fine, mixed, mesic Ultic Palexeralfs to fine, mixed, thermic Ultic Palexeralfs.\nDiagnostic horizons and features are as follows:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 22 inches (Ap, A1, A2, E); ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.  Clay content by field estimates is 18 percent. Organic matter is assumed to be less than 1 percent and decreases with depth.  B.S. is assumed to be between 35 to 50 percent.\n2.  Argillic horizon - 22 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); ranges from 28 to 50 inches thick.  B.S. by grab sample was between 35 to 50 percent.  The Textural control section is 22 to 42 inches or the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Clay content by field estimates of the textural control section was 43 percent.\n3.  Mixed mineralogy--by assumption--no cracks to indicate montmorillonitic.\n4.  Soil temperature 59 to 62 degrees F, based on similar soils in area--all data from other surveys in area show similar grassland soils to be thermic not mesic.\n5.  Soil moisture in control section.\nMoist in some parts soil temperature greater than 41 degrees F--259 days (71 percent of time).\nMoist in some parts soil temperature more than 46 degrees F.  (3/1-6/15) 107 days.\nLast revised by the state on 6/88.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
