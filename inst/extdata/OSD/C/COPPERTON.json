  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick.  Weakly to moderately cemented, very strong lime horizons occur at depths of 12 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the 8 to 24 inch depth in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak to moderate platy or granular structure.  The AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly loam with 50 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  The C1ca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly loam or silt loam, with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon is weakly to moderately cemented.  The C2ca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from very gravelly or very cobbly loamy sand to silt loam with 70 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  Streaks and thin strata of nongravelly materials occur at varying depths in some places in the C horizons of these soils."

Alpowa and Benge soils lack cementation in the Cca horizon.  Also, Benge soils have basalt gravel and sand at depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Bezzant soils are calcareous throughout and have mean annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Hupp and Lakewin soils have cambic horizons, and Lakewin soils are coarse, loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Middle soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Picayune soils have cambic horizons and have mean annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Copperton soils are on convex, short, sloping to very steep (5 to 40 percent) southerly exposures of the slopes and ridges that parallel drainageways at the base of the mountains.  Elevations range from 5,150 to about 6,000 feet.  The soils formed in deep very gravelly and very cobbly alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary parent rocks.  The climate is moist subhumid, with an annual precipitation averaging 17 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 60 degrees F.  The frost free season is 120 to 150 days."

Bingham, Dry Creek, and Henefer soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments and have argillic horizons.  Also, Henefer soils lack lime horizons and have mean annual soil temperature less than 47 degrees F.  Gappmayer soils have albic horizons, argillic horizons, and the mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  Red Rock soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and lack coarse fragments and calcic horizons."
