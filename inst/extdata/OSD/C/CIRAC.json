  "OVERVIEW": "The Cirac series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Cirac soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, lagoons, fan skirts, inset fans and axial stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
