  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Corydon soils are on sloping to very steep hills underlain with limestone. Slope gradients are dominantly greater than 20 percent but range from 6 to 70 percent. The soils formed in as much as 20 cm (8 inches) of loess and in the underlying limestone residuum. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 114.3 to 311 meters (375 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately deep Caneyville soils do not have a dark colored surface layer and typically are on the upper part of backslopes. The very deep Crider and deep Haggatt soils are on summits and shoulders and do not have a dark colored surface layer. The moderately deep Romona soils are on simliar landform positions."
