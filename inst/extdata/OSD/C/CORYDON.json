  "STATES": "IN,KY,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Corydon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in as much as 20 cm (8 inches) of loess and in the underlying limestone residuum. The Corydon soils are on hills underlain with limestone. Slope ranges from 6 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
