  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise stated, depth ranges in this paragraph are measured from the top of the mineral surface to the designated depth.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches from the mineral surface.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 40 percent, cobble content ranges from 15 to 40 percent, and stone content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Total volume of rock fragments averages 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size and series control section.  The coarse fragments are dominantly sandstone.  Mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2, and has a chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  It is dominantly very cobbly fine sandy loam, but the range includes very cobbly sandy loam, or the very gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist or 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very cobbly or very gravelly, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very cobbly or very gravelly, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  It is very cobbly or very gravelly, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some  pedons contain thin layers of very gravelly coarse sand above the sandstone bedrock.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nA Cr horizon, 1 to 5 inches thick, is present in some pedons.  It is dominantly weathered from sandstone but some pedons contain layers of shale."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free period is 100 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Jacobsville, Zeba, Munising, Yalmer and Waiska soils are common associates.  The moderately well drained Munising and Yalmer soils are on similar landscape positions and are greater than 60 inches to sandstone.  The excessively drained Waiska soils are on slightly higher landscape positions, are sandy-skeletal, and are also greater than 60 inches to sandstone.  The somewhat poorly drained Zeba and the very poorly drained Jacobsville soils have fewer coarse fragments and occur in drainageways and depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  The soil has a seasonal high water table that is perched above the sandstone 1 to 1.5 feet below the surface for short time periods from October to May.  Permeability is moderate.  Surface runoff is negligible to medium, dependent on slope."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are forested.  Native vegetation is primarily mixed northern hardwoods with sugar maple being the dominant species.  Significant amounts of quaking aspen, red maple and balsam fir are present depending on past management.  Common ground plants in undisturbed areas include spinulose shield fern, oak fern, American starflower, solomon's seal, twisted stalk, and wild lily-of-the-valley."
