  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in glacial till, glaciofluvial, or alluvial deposits of mixed mineralogy.  Elevations are of 700 to 1,800 feet.  They occur in a climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is 73 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 190 days."
