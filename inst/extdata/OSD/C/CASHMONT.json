  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cashmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till, glaciofluvial, or alluvial deposits. They are on alluvial fans, till plains, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

The soils formed in glacial till, glaciofluvial, or alluvial deposits of mixed mineralogy.  Elevations are of 700 to 1,800 feet.  They occur in a climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is 73 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 190 days."
