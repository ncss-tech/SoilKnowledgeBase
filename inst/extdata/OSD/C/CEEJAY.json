  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ceejay soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,995 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
