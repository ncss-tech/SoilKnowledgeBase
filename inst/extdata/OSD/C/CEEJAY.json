  "OVERVIEW": "The Ceejay series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Ceejay soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
