These soils formed in loamy materials overlying loam or clay loam glacial drift or till at depths typically between 24 and 36 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but is loam or sandy loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but is sandy loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loamy fine sandy or loamy sand but is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has few or common, faint, or distinct redoxomorphic features and has carbonates in some pedons.\nSome pedons have Bk or 2Bk horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or clay loam but has thin layers of stratified loam to fine sand in some pedons.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Redoxomorphic features range from few to many, and are faint  to prominent.  Most pedons have an accumulations of carbonate in the upper part of the 2C horizon."

Blendon, Doger, and Forestburg soils are in similar landscapes. Doger soils are sandy and Forestburg soils are sandy over loamy.  The Clarno, Hand, and Houdek soils are fine-loamy and formed in glacial till or drift.  They are on ridges and knobs in nearby landscapes. Elsmere soils are wetter and in lower positions.  Fedora soils have calcic horizons and are in swales and drainageways."
