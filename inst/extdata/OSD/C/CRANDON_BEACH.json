Non-Forested areas may include but are not limited to various species of cordgrass (Spartina spp.), needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus), salt grass (Distichlis spicata), and various flowering forbs. Changes in salinity (ppt) is often the main driver between different major zones of vegetative species in both forested and non-forested areas."
