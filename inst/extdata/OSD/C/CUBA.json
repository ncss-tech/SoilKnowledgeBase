  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuba series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in acid, silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps and natural levees. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cuba soils formed in acid, silty alluvium on flood plains, flood-plain steps and natural levees along major streams and their tributaries. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The alluvium is derived mainly from areas of loess capped sandstone, siltstone and shale hills, and loess capped till plains of the Illinoian stage. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.5 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 119 cm (40 to 47 inches). Frost free period is 170 to 210 days."

Cuba soils are on natural levees and alluvial fans, Steff and Stendal soils are on slightly lower lying flood-plain steps and Bonnie soils are on backswamps and on abandoned meander belts."
