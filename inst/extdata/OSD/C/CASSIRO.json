These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks or in colluvium derived from quartzite and conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,285 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
