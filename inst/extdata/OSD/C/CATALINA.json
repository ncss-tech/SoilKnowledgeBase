No subhorizon below 7 inches is dry for as long as 60 consecutives days during the year.  Cation retention ranges from 1 to 10 meq/100 grams of clay.  CEC is 16 meq/100 grams of clay or less (ammonium acetate). Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is less than 35 percent in any subhorizon of the oxic.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 and 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of          3 to 5; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red and brown.  Content of saprolite ranges from 5 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay.\nThe lower part of the C horizon is composed of saprolite and has no dominant color.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catalina soils are on side slopes and hill tops of uplands.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  They formed in regolith consisting of fine-textured residuum that is derived from very highly weathered volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The mean average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Consumo, Daguey, Humatas, and Mucara series.  All of these soils are on similar positions as Catalina soils.  Consumo soils are moderately deep to saprolite, have less clay in the control section, and are not as weathered.  Daguey soils have less clay in the subsoil and have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Humatas soils are Ultisols, are less weathered, and have parasesquic mineralogy.  Mucara soils are moderately deep over igneous rock and have less clay in the subsoils."
