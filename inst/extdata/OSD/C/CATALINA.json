  "OVERVIEW": "The Catalina series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on side slopes and hill tops of uplands.  They formed in residuum that weathered from volcanic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.",
