  "OVERVIEW": "The Cronks series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from quartzite and andesite.  Cronks soils are on foothills and mountains and have slopes of 6 to 60 percent.  Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
