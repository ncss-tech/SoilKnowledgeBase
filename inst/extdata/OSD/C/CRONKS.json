The soils formed in mixed slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from quartzite and andesite. The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  Average summer air temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
