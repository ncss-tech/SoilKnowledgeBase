    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Halso series is the only other known series in the same family. The Beatrice series is in a closely related family. Halso soils are on similar positions and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Beatrice soils are on similar to lower less sloping positions and have more clay in the control section."

The well drained Arundel soils are moderately deep to siltstone. The poorly drained Bibb and somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils on adjacent lower flood plains. The somewhat excessively drained to moderately well drained Blanton and somewhat excessively drained Troup soils are on higher adjacent positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness. The well drained Lucy and Orangeburg soils are on higher adjacent positions. In addition, Lucy soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Orangeburg soils have fine-loamy control sections. The well drained Luverne and the moderately well drained Sacul soils are on similar positions and have mixed mineralogy control sections. The moderately well and well drained Poarch soils are on higher adjacent positions and have coarse-loamy control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Conecuh series was formerly included in the Boswell and Susquehanna series and, in more recent legends, the Beatrice series.\nA special study is needed to determine if Conecuh is somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained. Several typifying pedons in published soil surveys indicate they may be somewhat poorly drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 5 inches to a depth of 39 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nAquic feature - the zone from a depth of 17 inches to a depth of 63 inches, presence of mottles with chroma of 2 or less (Bt3, Bt4, BC and C horizons).\nConecuh soils are in MLRA 133A.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Complete characterization data are available on 4 pedons; partial characterization data are available on 5 additional pedons; Engineering Test Data are available on 2 additional pedons.  These soils were first recognized as pedon Number 1 in \"A Lithosequence in Coastal Plain Sediments in Alabama\" by R. A. Hoyum and B. F. Hajek, Soil Science Society of American Journal, Volume 43, No. 1, January - February, 1979.\nLaboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http;://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data was provided by Auburn University, Soil Characterization laboratory, Auburn AL\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
