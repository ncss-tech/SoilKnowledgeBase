  "OVERVIEW": "The Conecuh series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands and hill slopes of the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A). They formed in clayey and shaley marine sediments. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.",

Several typifying pedons in published soil surveys indicate they may be somewhat poorly drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 5 inches to a depth of 39 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nAquic feature - the zone from a depth of 17 inches to a depth of 63 inches, presence of mottles with chroma of 2 or less (Bt3, Bt4, BC and C horizons).\nConecuh soils are in MLRA 133A."
