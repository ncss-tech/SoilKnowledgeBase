Depth to calcic horizon is 20 to 43 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The argillic horizon is more than 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is 22 to 30 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 34 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam,  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Some pedons lack a Btk horizon and have a Bk horizon.  It is moderately alkaline in most Btk horizons, strongly alkaline, and ranges to 1 in Bk horizons."
