  "OVERVIEW": "The Caplis series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in recent calcareous loamy alluvial sediments deposited over reddish clayey alluvium. Permeability is rapid in the upper part and very slow in the lower part of the soil. These soils are on level to gently sloping flood plains of the Red River. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

These soils formed in recent loamy sediments deposited over alluvial clays on natural levee splays. These splays formed during periods of higher river levels associated with log jams on the upper Red River during the late 1800's Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches near the type location. Frost-free rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches."

Buxin, Latanier and Moreland soils are on lower positions on the natural levee or on backswamp positions. All of these soils have a clayey subsoil that begins within a depth of 20 inches. Coushatta soils are on higher positions on the natural levees, have a cambic horizon with its upper boundary within a depth of 10 inches, and do not have a clayey discontinuity within 36 inches of the soil surface. Severn soils are on lower positions on the natural levees and do not have a clayey discontinuity within 36 inches of the soil surface."
