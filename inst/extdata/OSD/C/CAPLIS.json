Caplis soils are calcareous in all parts between depths of 10 and 20 inches. Bedding planes are diagnostic and are present throughout the C horizon above the discontinuity\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam. Some pedons have thin strata of coarser or finer textured material. Bedding planes are present throughout the horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Reaction in cold, dilute HCl is very slightly to strongly effervescent in all parts.\nThe 2Bwssb horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay or clay.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Caplis soils are on level to gently sloping natural levees on flood plains that carry Permian Red Bed sediments. These soils formed in recent loamy sediments deposited over alluvial clays on natural levee splays. These splays formed during periods of higher river levels associated with log jams on the upper Red River during the late 1800's Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches near the type location. Frost-free rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches."

Buxin, Latanier and Moreland soils are on lower positions on the natural levee or on backswamp positions. All of these soils have a clayey subsoil that begins within a depth of 20 inches. Coushatta soils are on higher positions on the natural levees, have a cambic horizon with its upper boundary within a depth of 10 inches, and do not have a clayey discontinuity within 36 inches of the soil surface. Severn soils are on lower positions on the natural levees and do not have a clayey discontinuity within 36 inches of the soil surface."

Permeability is rapid in the loamy material and very slow in the clayey material. Runoff is negligible to very low."
