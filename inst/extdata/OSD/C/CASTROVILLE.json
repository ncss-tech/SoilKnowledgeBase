Atco and Karnes soils lack mollic epipedons.  Lewisville, Knippa, Nuvalde, Set, and Venus soils have temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Hidalgo and Venus soils have control sections that have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Knippa soils have coefficient of linear extensibility values of 0.09 or greater.  Uvalde soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time and have mixed mineralogy. Yauco soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F."

The soil formed in alluvium from limestone formations and it is high in calcium carbonate.  The climate is hot and dry subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 69 to 70 degrees F.  and mean annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 32 to 44.  Frost free days range from 230 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 650 to 1250 feet."
