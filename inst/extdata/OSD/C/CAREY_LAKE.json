  "OVERVIEW": "The Carey Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that\nformed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Carey Lake soils are on level\nto gently sloping alluvial fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4\npercent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is\nabout 43 degrees F.",
