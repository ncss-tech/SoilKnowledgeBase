  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to limestone and calcareous shale is 40 to 60 inches.  Loess thickness ranges from 6 to 18 inches.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have Bt horizons formed in the loess.\nThe IIBt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay or clay with a clay content of 50 to 60 percent.  It ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe IIC horizon has colors similar to the IIB and is clay or silty clay containing 30 to 70 percent coarse fragments.\nThe IICr horizon is clay shale interbedded with thin layers of limestone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Carmel is the only soil in this family.  Other similar soils are the Brookside, Eden, Lowell, and Pate.  Brookside and Pate soils have less clay and a higher percentage of coarse fragments in their sola.  Eden soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Lowell soils have gray colors or mottles in the lower part of the solum and lack potential for high shrink-swell."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carmel soils are on narrow ridges and on the upper part of hillsides where dissection or geologic erosion has removed all of the till and most of the loess cover.  Slope gradients range from 6 to 25 percent.  The upper 6 to 18 inches of the solum formed in loess and the lower part formed in residuum weathered from interbedded, soft, calcareous shale and limestone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eden, Bonnell, Nicholson, Switzerland, and Weisburg soils.  The Bonnell and Weisburg soils are on higher lying ridges or hillsides and have sola partially formed in till.  In addition, Weisburg soils have fragipans.  Eden soils are on steeper hillsides below Carmel soils and have more than 10 percent limestone fragments in the control section.  Nicholson and Switzerland soils formed in thicker layer of loess over residuum, and are on ridges and more gentle slopes at higher elevation.  In addition, Nicholson soils have fragipans."

Initial investigation indicates that these soils have COLE values of more than 0.09, but data are not conclusive that potential linear extensibility is more than 6 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data are available on two (2) pedons at Purdue Lab, No. DB 7506 and OH 7508 and two (2) pedons at Lincoln Lab No. 760037-760041 and 760075-760080.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
