  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soil name is taken from a local town. This soil is found in areas of irrigated cropland. Often these areas have been highly disturbed by farming activities. Most areas are mechanically plowed, ripped and chiseled to the surface of the duripan routinely. Also large amounts of organic matter, usually as manure, has been added to the soil, along with farm chemicals and soil amendments, and very large amounts of irrigation water over long periods of time. This has affected the carbonates, salinity, sodicity and the duripan. In most of the area the duripan is still present as described here, but in all areas it has been affected by the above mentioned disturbances. More study is needed to determine just exactly what the affects on the duripan are.\nSome pedons are violently effervescent just above the duripan.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\n1.  Ochric epipedon--The zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\n1.1 The thickness of the epipedon is less than one-third of the depth from the top of the epipedon to the upper boundary of the duripan.\n2.  Indurated Duripan--The zone from 25 to a depth of 33 inches (2Bqkm horizon).\n3.  Cambic horizon--The zone from 7 inches to a depth of 25 inches (Bw horizon).\nOther features: Saline-sodic phases of this soil are recognized."
