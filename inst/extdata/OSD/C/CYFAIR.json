  "REVDATE": "08/2018",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cyfair series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Lissie Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent, but most are less than 0.5 percent due to leveling.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).",
