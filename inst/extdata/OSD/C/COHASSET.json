  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic or lithic contact of weathered rock ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  The soil between depths of about 6 and 24 inches is usually moist; however, it is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days from sometime in June through October.  Mean annual soil temperature is between 54 and 59 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are in all horizons and range up to 35 percent.  The soil is influenced by amorphous material.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4, 5/2, 4/2; 5YR 5/8, 4/8, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4, 5/3, or 4/3.  It is sandy loam, or loam, and may have gravelly or cobbly modifiers.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid and contains concretions.  This horizon is either too thin or value and chroma are too high to be umbric or mollic.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/8, 6/6, 5/6, 6/4, 5/4 or 4/6; 5YR 5/8, 4/8, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4, 5/3, or 4/3 and 2.5YR 5/4.  It is loam or clay loam and is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons.  Clay content averages 25 to 35 percent and coarse sand and very coarse sand combined total 5 to 15 percent.  Base saturation averages 35 to 50 percent usually decreasing with depth.  It is medium acid through very strongly acid.  Some pedons have a BC or C horizon."

Boomer, Cle Elum, Glenview, Holland, McGowan, Teanaway, and Wohly soils all average 50 to 75 percent base saturation in the control section. Casabonne, Centralia, Cherryhill, Cle Elum, Dalig, Fives, Gunn, Hood, Kalama, Latourell, McGowan, Para, Rosehaven, Speaker, Teanaway, Tigit, Trelk, Underwood, Varelum, Wilkeson and Wohly are all dry in the control section for less than 120 days in most years.  Crozier and Hotaw soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Musick soils have more than 15 percent coarse plus very coarse sand in the control section."

Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  They are at elevations of about 800 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is moist, subhumid with warm, nearly dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 70 inches.  Snow covers the higher elevations from December until March.  The average January temperature is about 30 to 35 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 63 to 68 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 58 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 100 to 250 days."
