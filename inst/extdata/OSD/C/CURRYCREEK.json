  "OVERVIEW": "The Currycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in landslide deposits and colluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary sources.  These soils occur on landslides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
