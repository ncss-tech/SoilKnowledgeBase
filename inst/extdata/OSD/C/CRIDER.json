  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 160 inches; commonly more than 100 inches.  Fragments of chert ranges from 0 to about 15 percent; in some pedons it ranges 0 to 35 percent below the lithologic discontinuity.  Reaction is from neutral to strongly acid to a depth of 40 inches, and from moderately acid to very strongly acid below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon, in the upper part, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  In the lower part has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow, and occasionally shades of gray in the lower part. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons may have 2C or 2BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the 2Bt horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bluegrass, Peridge and Ryker series in the same family.  Bluegrass soils are formed in loess and residuum weathered from underlying phosphatic limestone bedrock.  Peridge soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the lower subsoil.  Ryker soils are formed in loess, glacial till, and residuum weathered from underlying limestone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crider soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands.  Slopes commonly range from 0 to 12 percent, but the range allows to 30 percent.  Many areas are undulating to rolling karst topography.  The upper 20 to 45 inches of the solum formed in loess and the lower part formed in limestone residuum or old alluvium.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperatures is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation 48 inches."

Baxter, Beasley, Hagerstown, and Lowell soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper Bt horizons.  Nicholson soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Nolin soils are in depressions or on floodplains and lack argillic horizons.  Pembroke soils have a mollic epipedon."
