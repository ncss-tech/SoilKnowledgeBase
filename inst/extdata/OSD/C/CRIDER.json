  "OVERVIEW": "The Crider series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in a loess mantle and the underlying residuum from limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 160 inches; commonly more than 100 inches.  Fragments of chert ranges from 0 to about 15 percent; in some pedons it ranges 0 to 35 percent below the lithologic discontinuity.  Reaction is from neutral to strongly acid to a depth of 40 inches, and from moderately acid to very strongly acid below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon, in the upper part, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  In the lower part has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow, and occasionally shades of gray in the lower part. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons may have 2C or 2BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the 2Bt horizon."

Bluegrass soils are formed in loess and residuum weathered from underlying phosphatic limestone bedrock.  Peridge soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the lower subsoil.

Many areas are undulating to rolling karst topography.  The upper 20 to 45 inches of the solum formed in loess and the lower part formed in limestone residuum or old alluvium.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperatures is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation 48 inches."

Nolin soils are in depressions or on floodplains and lack argillic horizons.  Pembroke soils have a mollic epipedon."
