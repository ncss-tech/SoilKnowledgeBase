The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the argillic horizon is 10 to 17 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 35 percent in the particle size control section.  The particle size control section contains less than 15 percent very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent. It is moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5 dry and moist.
