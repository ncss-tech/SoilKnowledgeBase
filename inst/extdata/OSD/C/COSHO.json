These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift. The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,700 to 2,500 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
