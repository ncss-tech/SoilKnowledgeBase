Abracon, Chroder, Cobbra (UT), Harvey, Milok, Mivida, Nala, and Yattle soils are all greater than 40 inches to a bedrock contact. Anasazi soils have hues of 5YR or redder. Chugcity soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over a paralithic contact. Sazi soils have a cambic horizon, have hue of 5YR and 2.5YR, and typically contain less than 5 percent rock fragments.   Abracon, Chroder, Cobbra, Harvey, Milok, Mivida, Nala, and Yattle soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Chugcity soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chupadera soils formed on crests and sideslopes of rolling hills and on structural benches within undulating plateaus.. These soils formed in eolian sands and material weathered from limestone, sandstone, and shale withelevations ranging from 6,000 to 6,700 feet and slopes ranging from 1 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches. Average annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees. Frost free period is 120 to 160 days. In Carbon County, Utah this soil has been correlated with elevations as low as 5900 feet, air temperatures of 45 to 47 degrees F., precipitation as low as 11 inches, and a frost free period of 100 to 120 days."
