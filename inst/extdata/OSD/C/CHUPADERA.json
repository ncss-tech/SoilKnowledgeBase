  "OVERVIEW": "The Chupadera series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sands and residuum from limestone on rolling bedrock controlled uplands and on structural benches of plateaus. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 F.",

Abracon, Chroder, Cobbra (UT), Harvey, Milok, Mivida, Nala, and Yattle soils are all greater than 40 inches to a bedrock contact. ThumbRock soils have hues of 5YR or redder. Chugcity soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over a paralithic contact. Sazi soils have a cambic horizon, have hue of 5YR and 2.5YR, and typically contain less than 5 percent rock fragments.   Abracon, Chroder, Cobbra, Harvey, Milok, Mivida, Nala, and Yattle soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Chugcity soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact."

Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches. Average annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees. Frost free period is 120 to 160 days. In Carbon County, Utah this soil has been correlated with elevations as low as 5900 feet, air temperatures of 45 to 47 degrees F., precipitation as low as 11 inches, and a frost free period of 100 to 120 days."
