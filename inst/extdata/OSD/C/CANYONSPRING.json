  "OVERVIEW": "The Canyonspring series consists of shallow, well-drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from gneiss and granitoid rock. The Canyonspring soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 9 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 435 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
