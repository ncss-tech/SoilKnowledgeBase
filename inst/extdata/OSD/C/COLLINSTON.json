  "OVERVIEW": "The Collinston series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and lake sediments on lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The average precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F., and the average summer temperature from 62 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but they are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the 4 and 12 inch depth in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches in thickness.  Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  The series control section averages silt loam and contains more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma between 1 and 3.  It has weak to moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline and is moderately or strongly calcareous.  It contains 2.5 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has coarse subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It is mildly to strongly alkaline and strongly or very strongly calcareous and contains 30 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in individual subhorizons, with the particle-size control section averaging less than 40 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:\nErda (UT): Erda soils don't include chroma of 1 in the A-horizon and don't allow hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the range; Erda and Collinston are similar soils; because of different moisture regime assumptions used over time Erda was formerly classified as an Aridic Calcixerolls; consistent application of moisture regime assumptions has resulted in the soils now having the same classification.\nFielding (UT): Fielding soils have a cambic horizon and a watertable at 45 to 60 inches."

The climate is moist or dry subhumid.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 17 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F., and the average summer is 63 to 68 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 160 days."

Avon soils have an argillic horizon and clay content of more than 35 percent in the control section.  Blackrock and Crookston soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Causey soils are noncalcareous in the upper part and are in the fine-loamy family.  Hawkins soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Manila soils have argillic horizons that contain more than 35 percent clay.  Mendon soils have an argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Wheelon soils lack mollic epipedons."

In Utah this series is correlated with Upland range sites."
