  "OVERVIEW": "The Corbly series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0  to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
