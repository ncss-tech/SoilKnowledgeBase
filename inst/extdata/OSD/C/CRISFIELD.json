  "OVERVIEW": "The Crisfield series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived from moderately rapidly permeable soils on high floodplains of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches (71 centimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F (15 degrees C).",
