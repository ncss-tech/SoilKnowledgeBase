  "OVERVIEW": "The Chubard series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash.  Chubard soils are on hills, mountains and rock pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Phliss soils have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 8 to 25 cm and are dry throughout from July through September. Richinde soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Rowel soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Stewval soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 11 degrees C. Thike soils average 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,326 to 2,500 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
