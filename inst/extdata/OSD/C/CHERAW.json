  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheraw series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary deposits.  Cheraw soils are on flood plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
