  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F.  The soils are saturated most of the year.  Chroma, moist, is 1 or less throughout. Estimated moist bulk density of the fine earth fraction is 0.4 to 0.6 grams per cubic centimeter. It averages 8 to 15 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent pumice fragments 2 to 10mm in diameter.  The soils are neutral to moderately alkaline. Organic carbon decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The transition between the upper part of the particle-size control section (A horizon) and the lower part (BC horizon) is clear or gradual.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy loam, or gravelly loam with 5 to 20 percent gravel-size pumice fragments of 2 to 10mm in diameter.  It has 12 to 20 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample.  Phosphate retention is 25 to 35 percent.  It has 40 to 70 percent glass.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 1.0.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam, or paragravelly ashy loam with 10 to 35 percent gravel-size pumice fragments of 2 to 10 mm in diameter.  It has 8 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample, 60 to 90 percent glass and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 1.0.  Phosphate retention is 25 to 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvium of water sorted ash from pumice flows.  Elevations are 4,150 to 4,400 feet. The climate is characterized by cold winters with much snow and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 to 27 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

The upper 7 inches (A horizon) meets Medial criteria based on lab data from the associated Kirk soil.  The pedon and the ranges of 15 bar water (dried) for the medial and ashy parts of the control section do not meet the requirements for a medial over ashy contrasting particle-size class when a combination of the 15 bar values are associated with the clear or gradual boundary between the A and BC1 horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
