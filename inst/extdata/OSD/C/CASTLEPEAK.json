Alflack and Stecum soils are moderately deep.  Chena soils have an O horizon, lack a B horizon and lack stones  in the C horizon. Chenega soils have an O horizon and lack a B horizon.  Cryomont soils have an O horizon and are slightly acid or neutral.  Graylock soils have 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Howardsville soils lack Bw horizons and the precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mirror Lake soils have an O horizon and average summer soil temperature higher than 49 degrees F.  Nataga soils have an O horizon and lack stones in the C horizon.  Nizina soils have an average annual temperature of 23 to 27 degrees F.  Obscurity soils have 15 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates in the control section.  Polepatch soils have an O horizon, have boulders on the surface and have 10 to 40 percent volcanic glass in the particle-size control section.  Studebaker soils have 15 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 1 to 6 percent and elevations are 6,300 feet  to 7,500 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Average annual temperature is 33 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 5 to 30 days."
