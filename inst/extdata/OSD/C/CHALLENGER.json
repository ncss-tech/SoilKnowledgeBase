Amole soils are moist in the moisture control section for up to 60 days during the summer months, and are somewhat excessively drained. Orwash and Yellowrock soils average 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, and are somewhat excessively drained. Redington soils are intermittently moist from July through September, have Cd horizons and have less than 10 percent clay throughout."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Challenger series is in MLRA 30.\nRunoff classes based on Ksat and slope as described in \"Terminology Used in Soil Survey Data Entry or Manuscript Editing of:\" 9-23-94 MAV.  Runoff changed from very slow to negligible to low.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 4 inches (A1 horizon)\n2. TEMPERATURE REGIME -- Thermic. Based on soil temperature data from surrounding soil surveys and preliminary field measurements.  Mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from about December 15 to February 20, and is usually never below 41 degrees F.\n3. PARTICLE SIZE CLASS -- Sandy.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages 6.5 percent clay and 85 percent sand based on field estimates.  It does not qualify for sandy over loamy because there is more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser soil particles in the loamy material.\n4. MOISTURE REGIME - Aridic.  Based on soil moisture data from surrounding soil surveys.  The soil between the depths of 12 and 35 inches is dry throughout for 275 to 310 days from about March 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 10 to 50 days from about January 1 to March 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 55 to 90 consecutive days from about December 15 to March 1 when the soil is above 47.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/1997. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
