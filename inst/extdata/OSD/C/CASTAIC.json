  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of shale is 22 to 40 inches.  Depth to lime is more than 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees at any time.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal.  The soil between depths of 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from April until December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.\nThe Castaic series have brown, slightly acid, silty clay loam A horizons, yellowish brown, neutral, silty clay loam B horizons, light yellowish brown, calcareous shaly clay loam C horizons over shale at a depth of 36 inches.\nRock fragments consist of small pieces of shale.  Fragments make up to 15 percent of the A horizon and up to 35 percent of the lowermost 4 to 8 inches of the C horizon just above the paralithic contact.  The soil profile is silt loam or silty clay loam throughout.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown to light yellowish brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2).  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive in some part in some pedons.  This horizon averages less than 1 percent organic matter and it is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2 horizon is grayish brown to yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 5/3, 5/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/4).  Chroma is the same as in the A horizon or it is one unit brighter.  It has weak to strong subangular blocky structure.  It is usually neutral or mildly alkaline.  In some pedons the lower part of the B2 horizon or the transition to the lower horizon is moderately alkaline, and is effervescent with disseminated and segregated lime.\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray to light olive brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 5/4).  Lime is mostly disseminated, but segregation's are few to common and fine white powder is present in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Balcom, Fontana, Kettleman, Nacimiento, San Benito, Vernalis, and Zacharias series.  Balcom soils are effervescent throughout and have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Fontana, Nacimiento, and San Benito soils have mollic epipedons.  Kettleman soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Vernalis and Zacharias soils lack a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Castaic soils are strongly sloping to very steep and are on rounded hills at elevations of 50 to 2,500 feet.  They formed in residuum weathered from shale, sandstone, and mudstone.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature is 51 degrees F; average July temperature is 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 280 to 300 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Castaic soils were formerly classified as Regosols.  There are clear differentia to separate the Balcom series, but management and mapping considerations suggest little benefit is derived.\nThe classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as Fine-silty, mixed, thermic Calcixerollic Xerochrepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nLast major revision by the state on 10/73.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
