    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chad soils are on mountain side slopes. These soils formed in residuum derived from chert and shale, with small components of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,829 to 2,499 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 4l0 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 50 to 80 days."
