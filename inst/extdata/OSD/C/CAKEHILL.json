  "OVERVIEW": "The Cakehill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Cakehill soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
