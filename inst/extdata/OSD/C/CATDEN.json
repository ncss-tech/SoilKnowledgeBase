  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic material extends to a depth of 51 inches or more. The reaction throughout the pedon ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in 0.01M calcium chloride. The pH value is 4.5 or more (in 0.01M calcium chloride) in one or more layers of organic soil materials within the control section. Woody fragments occur throughout the profile in most pedons consisting of twigs, branches, logs or stumps, and range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the control section. Fragments range in size from 2 cm to more than a 30 cm diameter.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 1 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 6. It is dominantly muck (sapric material); however, some pedons have surface layers of peat (fibric material) or mucky peat (hemic material). The structure of the surface tier is weak or medium, coarse to fine granular, platy, subangular blocky, or is massive.\nThe subsurface tier has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 4. Chroma or value or both may change from 0.5 to 2 units upon rubbing. Broken faces become darker upon brief exposure to air. The layer is dominated by sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of less than 17 percent of the organic volume. The subsurface tier has granular or blocky structure or is massive. The unrubbed, well-decomposed organic material is typically derived from woody plant tissue.\nThe bottom tier has colors similar to the subsurface tier and has variable amounts of woody and herbaceous layers, however, woody fibers are dominant. This tier commonly is massive but in some pedons it has weak coarse blocky or thick platy structure. The subsurface and bottom tiers are dominantly sapric material but some pedons have thin layers of hemic material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carlisle, Houghton, Lena, Peteetneet, Saltese, and Semiahmoo series. Carlisle soils are dominantly herbaceous fibers in the bottom tier, are moist for more than 60 cumulative days in any part of the upper 15 cm in a normal year, and have mean annual precipitation less than 1190 mm. Houghton soils formed primarily in herbaceous materials, are moist for more than 60 cumulative days in any part of the upper 15 cm in a normal year, and have a mean annual precipitation less than 1190 mm. Lena, Peteetneet, Saltese, and Semiahmoo soils are from outside LRRs R and S. Lena soils contain free carbonates throughout. Peteetneet soils have an annual precipitation of less than 40 cm. Saltese soils have an annual precipitation of less than 560 mm. Semiahmoo soils have mean summer temperatures less than 18 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Catden soils are in swamps, bogs and depressions on till plains, lake plains, outwash plains, and flood plains. These soils formed in highly decomposed woody and herbaceous organic materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation commonly is 1190 to 1270 mm but the range includes as low as 660 mm in some places east of Adirondack Mountains in the Champlain Valley of New York. The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."

Moderately well, somewhat poorly, poorly, or very poorly drained mineral soils such as Alden, Chippewa, Leicester, Ridgebury, Volusia, Whitman, and Wurtsboro occur at the margins of Catden areas as they grade to higher positions on the landscape. Freetown soils have a dysic reaction class. Halsey soils are in similar positions and are mineral soils. Natchaug and Timakwa soils are on similar positions and have mineral substrata at depths of 40 to 130 cm. Scarboro soils are in similar positions on outwash plains and are sandy. Wallkill soils are on similar positions and have mineral layers overlying the organic layers."

Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm above the surface to 30 cm below the surface from September to June. Surface runoff is very low or negligible.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was proposed as part of the Connecticut Statewide Update Survey, 2000. The name is taken from a local swamp. These soils were previously mapped in Connecticut as Carlisle and Peat and Muck.\nReaction reported in 1:2 0.01 M calcium chloride for all horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Sapric material - the zone from the surface to 255 cm (Oa1, Oa2, Oa3, Oa4 and Oa5 horizons).\n2. Euic reaction class - pH of 4.5 or more in  1:2 0.01 M calcium chloride in one or more organic layers within the control section (Oa1, Oa2, Oa3, Oa4 and part of the Oa5 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial characterization data for sample No. S84NY071001-006. Pedon analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 1984.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
