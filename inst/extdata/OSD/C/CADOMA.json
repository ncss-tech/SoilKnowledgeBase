LRM 03/01\nThis OSD had the classification, pedon description and type location changed but there is no record of why it was changed and no supporting documentation.  With this update the classification is being again revised.  Original classification was fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Ustollic Camborthids.  The revision in 2001 or earlier changed it to a fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Natrargids.  The pedon description changed a B2 horizon with glossy patches to a Bn horizon with clay films and a C1ca to a Bkny but there is no documentation that it was done in the field.  This update changes the pedon description back to what closely resembles the original, and changes the classification to the 10th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy equivalent of the original classification.
