  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cadoma series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slow or very slow permeable soils formed in fine textured residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from calcareous, sodic shale.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on uplands of rolling hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

LRM 03/01\nThis OSD had the classification, pedon description and type location changed but there is no record of why it was changed and no supporting documentation.  With this update the classification is being again revised.  Original classification was fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Ustollic Camborthids.  The revision in 2001 or earlier changed it to a fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Natrargids.  The pedon description changed a B2 horizon with glossy patches to a Bn horizon with clay films and a C1ca to a Bkny but there is no documentation that it was done in the field.  This update changes the pedon description back to what closely resembles the original, and changes the classification to the 10th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy equivalent of the original classification.
