  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Usually these soils are calcareous throughout, but may be leached to a depth of 10 to 18 inches.  The control section lacks continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate but some pedons have some visible accumulation.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick.  The 10- to 40- inch control section is usually loam or light clay loam stratified with thin lenses of sand and clay loam.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Mill soils are coarse-loamy and have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizons.  Uncom soils are coarse-loamy and have the lower part of their moisture control section moistened by a fluctuating water table or its capillary fringe."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in thick, stratified, calcareous, predominantly medium to moderately fine textured, mixed alluvium.  At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 130 to 160 days."
