  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Contee series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeables soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on flats on flat coastal plains. Slope is mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 3.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
