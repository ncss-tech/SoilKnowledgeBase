Cabba and Wayden soils are on knobs and ridges.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and do not have a natric horizon.  Daglum, Dogtooth, Janesburg and Farfeld soils are intermixed with the Cedarpan soil.  Daglum, Janesburg and Dogtooth soils have soft bedrock below a depth of 20 inches.  Farfeld soils do not have a natric horizon.  Farnuf, Lefor, Reeder, Regent and Savage soils are on fans.  They do not have a natric horizon and do not have a duripan within 20 inches of the surface."
