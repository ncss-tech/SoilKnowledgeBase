  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarpan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Permeability is very slow.  These soils are on upland drainage divides and have slopes ranging from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

Cabba and Wayden soils are on knobs and ridges.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and do not have a natric horizon.  Daglum, Dogtooth, Janesburg and Farfeld soils are intermixed with the Cedarpan soil.  Daglum, Janesburg and Dogtooth soils have soft bedrock below a depth of 20 inches.  Farfeld soils do not have a natric horizon.  Farnuf, Lefor, Reeder, Regent and Savage soils are on fans.  They do not have a natric horizon and do not have a duripan within 20 inches of the surface."
