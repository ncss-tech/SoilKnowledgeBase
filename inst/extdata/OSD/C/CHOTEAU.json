  "OVERVIEW": "The Choteau series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey alluvium or colluvium over shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on high terraces or uplands of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm (42 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).",

Bates soils are fine-loamy and have sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Collinsville soils are loamy and have sandstone within a depth of 20 inches.  Parsons, and Taloka soils are on the same landscape in slightly lower positions, have an ochric epipedon and an abrupt change in texture from the A horizon to the Bt horizon."
