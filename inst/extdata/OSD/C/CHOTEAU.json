Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but are generally 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium or colluvium over shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1170 mm (37 to 46 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C. (57 degrees to 63 degrees F.).  Frost free period is 190 to 220 days.  Elevation is 145 to 340 meters (475 to 1115 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 64 or more."

Apperson, Dennis, and Summit soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Bates and Collinsville soils are better drained and are on ridge crests.  Bates soils are fine-loamy and have sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Collinsville soils are loamy and have sandstone within a depth of 20 inches.  Parsons, and Taloka soils are on the same landscape in slightly lower positions, have an ochric epipedon and an abrupt change in texture from the A horizon to the Bt horizon."
