  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to contrasting strata of silt loam or very fine sandy loam ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Cracks ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 inch wide extend to depths of 30 inches or more. COLE ranges from .09 to .14.\nThe 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay loam or silty clay, with clay content ranging from 35 to 55 percent, and silt content in excess of 40 percent. Soil salinity ranges from slightly affected to strongly affected and increases with depth and ranges from 4 up to 20 or more dS/m within the root zone. These soils contain more than one percent organic matter in the epipedon, but the surfaces are very hard when dry.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. It is weak to moderate subangular blocky and blocky. A few pressure faces or small slickensides occur in the B horizon and 2C horizon.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay somewhat stratified in most pedons.\nAccumulation of calcium carbonate in the B, 2C, and 3C horizons ranges from a few masses or concretions to 3 percent of weakly cemented and strongly cemented concretions."

Runn soils have epipedons that are not hard setting and do not have mollic colors. Cameron soils have contrasting clayey over loamy textures in the 10- to 40-inch control sections. Harlingen soils have intersecting slickensides and have epipedons with moist values of more than 3.5. Knippa soils have a calcic horizon within 40 inches of the surface. Laredo and McAllen soils have less than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Olmito and Raymondville soils have mollic epipedons and in addition, Raymondville soils contain 20 to 40 percent sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soil formed in alluvial silty clays or silty clay loams over stratified silty sediments many feet thick. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 26 to about 36."
