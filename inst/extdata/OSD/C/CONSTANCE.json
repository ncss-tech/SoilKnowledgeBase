Mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 3 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days during summer; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc., acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR and a chroma of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
