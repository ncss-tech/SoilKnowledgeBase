  "OVERVIEW": "The Constance series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt, sedimentary and associated metasedimentary and meta volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days during summer; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc., acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR and a chroma of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
