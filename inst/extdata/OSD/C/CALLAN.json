    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches.  The upper 7 inches after mixing are mollic in color.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.  Solum thickness is typically 16 to 26 inches to the base of the argillic horizon but ranges from 13 to 28 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 50 percent in the calcic horizon.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, and summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry between 4 and 12 inches during the period that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  It has strong or moderate angular blocky structure but has weak prismatic structure in some pedons.\nThe Bk1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bk2 horizon PEs hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nBuried Btk horizons are common below depths of 44 inches."

These data classified the soil as fine-silty; however, dispersion was a problem and it is agreed that there is 3 to 5 percent more clay than the 31 percent featured in the lab data.  Using more dispersion agent, up to 40 percent clay has been analyzed in the Bt horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
