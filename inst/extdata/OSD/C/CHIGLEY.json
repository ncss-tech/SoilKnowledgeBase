Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have redoximorphic concentrations in shades of red or brown.  Texture is sandy clay, gravelly sandy clay, clay, gravelly clay, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  Fragments of granite, sandstone, quartz, and limestone from 2 to 76 mm in diameter make up 5 to 35 percent by volume and is above 10 percent in some subhorizon.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has the same color, redoximorphic concentrations, texture, and percent of coarse fragments as the Bt1 horizon.  Hue of 10YR are also included.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Callisburg, Hamby, Minwells, Pedernales, Truce, Voca, Windthorst, and Winters series in thesame family.  Soils in similar families are Agan, Aydelotte, and Payne series.  Agan, Aydelotte, Callisburg, and Hamby soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  In addition, Agan and Aydelotte soils have cracks of 1 cm or more wide at a depth of 20 inches that extends to the surface.  Callisburg and Hamby soils lack Bt horizons and have up to 10 percent coarse fragments.  Minwells soils lack mottles in the argillic horizon and lack hard bedrock within 80 inches.  Payne soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Pedernales soils have calcic horizons.  Truce and Voca soils lack hard bedrock within 80 inches, and lack Bt horizons having or made on 10 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Voca soils occur in areas of less moisture.  Windthorst and Winters soils lack Bt horizons having as much as 10 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Winters soils have secondary carbonates at depths of 28 to 50 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chigley soils are on very gently sloping to steep convex uplands in the Grand Prairie.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  They formed in material weathered from conglomerate rock of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 54 to 64.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet."

In addition, Clarita soils occur on broad flats that are usually less sloping.  Durant and Tussy soils have smectitic mineralogy and cracks 1 cm or more wide at a depth of 20 inches that extends to the surface.  In addition, Durant soils have mollic epipedons and occur on broad flats and are usually less sloping.  Newalla soils lack an abrupt textural change from the E horizon to the Bt horizon and occur on broad ridge crests.  Ravia soils have fine-loamy control sections and mollic epipedons."
