  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact and bedrock is typically about 28 to 32 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation is 7 to 26 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 26 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are soft shale channers or semirounded sandstone pebbles.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the Bt is clay loam or loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 3 to 12 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent total clay of which about 2 to 4 percent is carbonate clay.  Reaction is typically moderately alkaline but may be strongly alkaline when sodic shales are present.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent, but some horizons may exceed 15 percent but are discontinuous or too thin to be considered as a calcic.\nThe Cr is weakly consolidated sedimentary rock.  It is primarily calcareous shale; but siltstone or thinly interbedded fine grained argillaceous sandstone is common. The rock is typically moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline when crushed, but slightly alkaline or neutral shales are not uncommon."

It is assumed the Gaddes and Yenlo are competing pending an update of the classification.  Balon, Blancot, Buckle, Cambria, Cerrillos, Decolney, Doakum, Forkwood, Los Alamos, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Palacid, Penistaja, Potts, Quagwa, Redpen, Spenlo, Sundance, Teckla and Yenlo soils are deeper than 40 inches to any bedrock.  Gaddes, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest and Progresso soils have lithic contacts between 20 and 40 inches.  Bowbac and Pugsley soils have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Pugsley soils are also noncalcareous throughout.  Pokeman soils have redder hue and have a paralithic contact to gypsum or alabaster at 20 to 40 inches.  Spangler soils are noncalcareous throughout and lack a Bk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cushman soils are on buttes, fan remnants fan piedmonts, hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured slopewash alluvium and residuum.  Surface erosion is common in overgrazed areas, and some thin eolian deposits overlie these soils in some areas.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches and ranges from 10 to 14 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September and October.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
