  "OVERVIEW": "The Clancy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on hills, ridges and escarpments. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
