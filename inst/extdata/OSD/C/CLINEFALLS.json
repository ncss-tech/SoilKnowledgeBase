    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 120 to 150 days (cumulative).  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  Depth to the stratified sand and gravel is 20 to 40 inches.  The ash mantle contains 20 to 50 percent pumice sand (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters), and an field estimated clay content of 5 to 10 percent.  The ash mantle contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates in the very fine sand fraction, a phosphate retention of 50 to 70 percent, a 15-bar water content of 5 to 10 percent on both dried and undried samples and an acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 5 to 25 percent gravel and the lower part averages 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments, primarily gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 5 to 15 percent gravel.  It is neutral.  Organic matter content is 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bw and BC horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly and very gravelly ashy sandy loam and ashy loamy sand.  It contains 15 to 45 percent gravel.  It is neutral.  Textures become more coarse with depth.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 8 dry, 2 to 7 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  It is 5 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is composed of stratified layers of sand and gravel with some cobbles.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."
