    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Camaguey, Naranjo, Santa Clara, and Sollar series.  The somewhat poorly drained Camaguey soils are on lower foot slope positions and have smectitic clay subsoils.  Naranjo and Soller soils are on similar positions as Colinas soils.  In addition, Naranjo soils are very deep to limestone and have finer-textured subsoils.  Soller soils are moderately deep to hard limestone bedrock and have clayey mixed mineralogy subsoils."
