They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,980 to 2,530 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 48 cm (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 48 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
