Gabica soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have 1 or 2 percent organic matter in the mollic epipedon.  Genoa soils have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 36 cm thick, are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Gerdog soils are 18 to 36 cm to the lithic contact and have 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the A horizons.  Gidwin soils have mollic epipedons with less than 5 percent organic matter. Grandeposit, Granquin and Realmcoy soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Hawkridge soils have 1 to 4 percent organic matter in the mollic epipedon and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Hutchley soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 28 to 35 percent clay.  Loope soils have 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the A horizons and have a mean summer soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C.  Melling soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Pernog soils are dominated by stones and have more than 27 percent clay in some part of the particle-size control section.  Rozara soils are dominated by fine gravel, have rock fragments that are granitic rocks, have 14 to 18 percent clay, and average 45 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Shalcleav soils are dominated by channers and flagstones and are 10 to 30 cm to a lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Celeridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder or backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,980 to 2,530 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 48 cm (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 48 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
