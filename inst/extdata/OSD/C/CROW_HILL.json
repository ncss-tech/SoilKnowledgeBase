  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of fractured soft diatomaceous shale is 20 to 40 inches. The solum is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly to very strongly acid and acidity tends to decrease with increasing depth.  Bulk density is less than 1 and averages about .85.  The mean annual soil temperature at the depth of 20 inches is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Soil between the depth of 5 to 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and is usually moist the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is gray or dark gray. It has moderate or strong structure in the upper part and ia granular except where severely trampled. A B horizon is typically present but some areas have an A horizon directly over the shale bedrock. Where the soil has a B horizon present, it is grayish brown or dark grayish brown. Few to common thin clay films line tubular and interstitial pores.\nThe B horizon has weak to moderate subangular blocky or granular structure. The underlying bedrock has few thin brown clay films on fracture planes. The shale is soft enough to be cut or chipped by hand tools.  It is bedded, highly fractuied and usually tllted."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Also Gazos and Nacimiento soils are calcareous throughout.  Lopez soils have shale at depths of less than 20 inches. Santa Lucia soils have bulk density of 1.0 to 1.3 and are skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crow Hill soils are rolling to very steep soils at elevations of 200 to 1600 feet. They formed in residuum weathered from diatomaceous shale bedrock. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool to warm rainless summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 18 inches. The average January temperature is 50 degrees F. near the coast and 47 degrees F. in the interior; the average July temperature is 63 degrees F. near the coast and 80 degrees F. in the interior; the mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F. near the coast and 62 degrees F. in the interior. The annual freeze-free season is 275 to 325 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Gazos, Linne, Lopez, Nacimiento and Santa Lucia soils and the Botella, Elder, Los 0808 and Maymen soils. Botella and Elder soils lack a paralithic contact above depth of 60 inches. Los Osos soils have an argillic horizon.  Maymen soils have an ochric epipedon and have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches."

Vegetation is California sagebrush and associated shrubs with understory of annual and perennial grasses near the coast and annual grasses and forbs with scattered live oak in warmer areas away from the fog influence."
