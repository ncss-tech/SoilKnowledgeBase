  "OVERVIEW": "The Chapot series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with a minor amount of volcanic ash.  Chapot soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Euer soils have solum thickness of 24 to 36 inches and umbric epipedons.  Inville soils have sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam Bt horizons.  Jorge soils are medium to very strongly acid in the argillic horizon and are dry for more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.
