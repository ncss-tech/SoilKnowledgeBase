Euer soils have solum thickness of 24 to 36 inches and umbric epipedons.  Inville soils have sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam Bt horizons.  Jorge soils are medium to very strongly acid in the argillic horizon and are dry for more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Lorack and Rasser soils have strongly acid argillic horizons.  Shaser soils have a 14 to 24 inches of volcanic ash mantle."

Chapot soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with a minor amount of volcanic ash.  They are in a climate of warm, dry summers and cool, moist winter.  The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 40 inches.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 135 to 180 days.  The frost-free season is 85 to 125 days."
