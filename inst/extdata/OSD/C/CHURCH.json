  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 18 to 43 inches.  Mineralogy is mixed.  The average soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees F. and less than 59 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in the 7 to 20 inch control section but are not dry in all parts above 12 inches more than half the time the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F.  The driest periods occur between October and May.  In the summer months they are infrequently inundated after heavy rains.  Ponding in the adjacent playas may cause high water tables in the C horizons during some years.  Thin layers of dark colored deposition range from 0 to 4 inches.  The color of the A horizon ranges in hue from 10YR to 2.5Y, in chroma from 1 to 2, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 3.5 to 5 moist.  The color of the B horizon ranges in hue from 2.5Y to 5Y, in chroma from 1 to 2, and in value from 2, and in value from 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  The texture of the B horizon and the control section is dominantly clay but ranges from heavy clay loam to silty clay with clay content ranging from 38 to 52 percent.  Lime accumulation ranges from none to a few threads or concretions.  The color of the C horizon ranges in hue from 2.5Y to 5Y, in chroma from 1 to 2, and in value from 6 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  The B and C horizons range from moderately to strongly alkaline and slightly to moderately saline.  Mottles due to segregated iron are few from 10 to 24 inches and few to common below 24 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known soils in the same family.  Closely related soils are in the Anamite and Litle series.  The Anamite soils lack strong gleying with prominent mottles of segregated iron, are noncalcareous in the upper part of the solum and have average annual soil temperatures of more than 59 degrees F.  The Litle soils lack gleying and have shale occurring within depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Church soils occur on level, low benches surrounding large enclosed basins or playas on the High Plains.  Slopes are typically less than 1 percent, but may range to 3 percent.  The regolith consists of fine textured, calcareous, moderately alkaline water-deposited sediments.  The climate is semi-arid continental.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches.  The average air temperature is 54 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 27.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 6,500 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Church soils were classified in the Calcisol or the Calcisol-Humic Gley intergrade great soil group in the modified 1938 yearbook classification system.  This revision modernizes the central concept on soils with only moderately dark surfaces, light colored strongly calcareous cambic horizons and gleyed C horizons.  Their sola are usually dry, but they have formed by weathering under acqueous or very moist conditions.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
