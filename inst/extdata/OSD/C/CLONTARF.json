  "STATES": "MN,ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clontarf series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately rapidly over rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity. They formed in loamy or loamy and sandy, glaciolacustrine or outwash sediments on glacial lake plains and deltas. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 43 degrees F.",

It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nA 2Bw horizon with sandy particle size is in some pedons. It is as thick as 10 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.
