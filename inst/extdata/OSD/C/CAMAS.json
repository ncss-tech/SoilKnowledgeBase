    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 45 to 110 consecutive days or more within the three month period following the summer solstice in most years. In MLRA 2, the soils are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days and\nin MLRA 5 from 70 to 110 consecutive days. The depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. Rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent in the upper 15 inches and 35 to 85 percent below. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam or cobbly loam. It has weak or moderate granular, very fine subangular blocky, or platy structure or is massive or single grain. It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 50 percent gravel.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand or sand and has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 20 to 50 percent gravel. It is massive or single grain.\nThe 2C horizon has the same color range as the C1 horizon. Texture is coarse sand, sand or loamy sand and has 3 to 20 percent cobbles and 35 to 70 percent gravel. It is massive or single grain."

The soils formed in gravelly and very gravelly coarse textured alluvium of mixed mineralogy. Winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 70 inches occurring mostly as rain in the fall, winter, and spring. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The mean July temperature is about 65 to 67 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is about 39 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 235 days."
