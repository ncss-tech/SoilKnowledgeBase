  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches thick.\nThe A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, gravelly, or very gravelly phases of these textures.  They range from 20 to 40 inches thick and from slightly acid through very strongly acid.  Nodules of ironstone range from 5 to 50 percent by volume and in many pedons are concentrated in the E horizon.  Graded phases are recognized.  The A horizon ranges from dark gray (10YR 4/1) to light gray (10YR 7/2), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  The E horizon ranges from gray (10YR 5/1) or light gray (10YR 7/1), to pale brown (10YR 6/3), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).\nThe Bt horizon ranges from brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8) with red or yellowish red mottles. It is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam, or clay.  Ironstone nodules range from few to 25 percent by volume.  Plinthite ranges from none to 10 percent by volume.  The Bt horizon is strongly or very strongly acid.   The Btv1 horizon ranges from brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8), with common to many yellowish red, red, or dark red mottles.  Plinthite ranges from 10 to 40 percent by volume.  The Btv2 horizon is mottled red, dark red, yellow, brownish yellow, strong brown, and gray.  Plinthite ranges from 10 to 50 percent by volume. The Btv2 and Btv3 horizons are sandy clay or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and less than 20 percent silt. Ironstone nodules range from few to 15 percent by volume and are strongly or very strongly acid.   The Btv3 and BCv horizons are reticulately and coarsely mottled red, dark red, light gray, yellowish brown, strong brown, or pale brown.  They are sandy clay or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid."

Depcor soils have loamy control sections and have base saturation greater than 35 percent.  Fuquay, Lilbert, and Rogan soils have loamy control sections.  In addition, Rogan soils lack sandy A horizons more than 20 inches thick.  Gunter soils have sandy A horizons more than 40 inches thick.  Sunsweet soils lack sandy A horizons more than 20 inches thick.  Wicksburg soils lack 5 percent or more plinthite in the solum"

The soil formed in unconsolidated acid sandy clays and sands with all known areas being the Willis formation of Pleistocene age.  The climate is humid with an average annual rainfall of 40 to 55 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F.and Thornthwaite P-E index exceeds 64."

Native vegetation is shortleaf, longleaf, and loblolly pine with such hardwoods as sweetgum, post oak, red oak, and hickory.  Understory is yaupon, wax-myrtle, American beautyberry, bay, and viburnum.  Many areas of Conroe soils have been surface mined for the ironstone nodules."
