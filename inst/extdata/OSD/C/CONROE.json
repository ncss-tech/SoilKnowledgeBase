  "OVERVIEW": "The Conroe series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in acid clayey and loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Willis Formation.  These soils occur on summits of interfluves of inland dissected coastal plains.  The slope range is 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
