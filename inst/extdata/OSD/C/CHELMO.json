Permeability is very slow or slow in the clayey deposits and rapid or moderately rapid in the underlying sandy substratum.  The 2Cg horizon has moderately rapid permeability and the 2C horizon has rapid permeability.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 0 to 1 foot from April to June in normal years.  The water table is perched due to the lithologic discontinuities along with contrasting particle sizes and permeabilities."
