  "REVDATE": "07/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuzzie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow over rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from tuff and monzonite.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
