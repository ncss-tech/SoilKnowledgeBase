  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A1 horizon,\nfrom very strongly acid to medium acid in the B21t horizons, and\nfrom very strongly acid to strongly acid in the IIB22t and IIB3 horizons.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and\nchroma of 2 or 3.  It is gravelly loam, loam, gravelly silt loam, silt loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nFragments of sandstone from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to\n20 percent by volume.\nIn some pedons there is a 3 to 5 inch thick A12 horizon similar to the A11 horizon.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Fragments of sandstone from\n2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 30 percent by volume and fragments 76 mm to 25 cm make up 0 to 10 percent by volume.\nThe IIB22t horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 6 to 8, with few to common mottles in shades of red,\nbrown, and gray.  The gray mottles are inherited from the\nunderlying material.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay with a clay content ranging from 35 to 70 percent but averaging 35 to 60 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Sandstone fragments 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter\nmake up 0 to 10 percent by volume and shale fragments 2 mm to 76\nmm in diameter make up 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe IIB3 horizon is mottled in hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to\n7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is shaly silty clay, shaly clay,\nsilty clay, or clay.  Shale fragments 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter\nmake up 5 to 25 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is soft shale that is commonly gray and brown, but\nis also red in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brantley, Canton Bend, Capshaw, Enon, Hampshire, Maben, Mecklenburg, and Zion series in the same family and the Barnsdall, Bolivar, Bosville, Carnasaw, Counts,\nHoma, McKamie, Porum, Stigler, Tamaha, Toine, Vinita, White Store, and Wister series of similar families.  Brantley and Capshaw soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick.  Canton Bend and Maben soils\nhave flakes of mica in the solum.  Enon and Mecklenburg soils are formed over saprolite, and are medium acid to mildly alkaline in\nthe lower part of the B horizon.  Hampshire soils are formed over interbedded limestone and shale at depth of 40 to 65 inches.  In addition, Hampshire and Zion soils are moist for longer periods of time.  Barnsdall soils have a fine-silty control section.  Bolivar and Toine soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Bosville,\nCounts, Porum, Stigler, and Tamaha soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick and have wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Carnasaw and Vinita soils have a lower base saturation.  Homa soils have a very-fine control section and wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface.  McKamie and White Store\nsoils have a COLE or 0.09 or more and cracks 1 cm or more wide at\na depth of 20 inches below the soil surface.  Wister soils have wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface and have an abrupt textural change between the A and B2t horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cowton soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep convex slopes and crests of low ridges in the\nvalley of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and\nRidges.  They are formed in material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Slopes are mainly 3 to\n10 percent but range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual\nprecipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Mean annual\ntemperature ranges from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64."

Stigler and Wister soils are\ngenerally on concave slopes. Vian soils have a fine-silty control section, are moderately well drained, and occur on convex slopes.  Wing soils commonly occur adjacent to drainageways and have a high sodium content in the subsoil."
