  "OVERVIEW": "The Chaddcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. Chaddcreek soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
