  "OVERVIEW": "The Carbine series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Carbine soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
