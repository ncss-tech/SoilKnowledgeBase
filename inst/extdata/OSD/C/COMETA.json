  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 8 and 20 inches is usually moist all of the time from November until late May or early June and is dry in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have dense, weakly cemented layers underlying the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2 or 5/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 4/3 or 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  The A horizon is massive and hard when dry and has less than 1 percent organic matter.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/4, 5/4, 4/6; 5YR 5/3, 4/3, 5/4, 4/4 or 4/6.  Moist colors are 1 or 2 units of value darker.  It is clay, sandy clay or clay loam.  The silt plus very fine sand is less than 40 percent.  Structure is strong angular blocky prismatic or columnar and when dry a thin layer of bleached sand grains is visible in some pedons as coatings capping columns.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nIn some pedons a Btq horizon is below the argillic horizon.  It has similar colors and reaction as C horizons and has clay films and weak silica cementation.  The horizon is dense and brittle, but is not a duripan because it slakes in water after prolong soaking and crushes to a sandy loam or coarse sandy loam texture.\nThe C horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4, 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/4.  They are compact, have high bulk density and are impermeable to moisture and roots.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The C horizon is weakly stratified."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cometa soils are on gently sloping and undulating, slightly dissected older stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  They occur at elevations of 20 to 600 feet in a subhumid climate with mean annual rainfall of 10 to 23 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F, average January temperature is 44 degrees F, and average July temperature is 79 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 260 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils were formerly classified as (maximal) Noncalcic Brown soils.  The Stockton area soil survey includes San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Calaveras counties.  The original type location was in Stanislaus County, but it was later moved to Madera County.\nThis update (12/87) correlate and correct the concept of the Cometa series as mapped in Eastern Fresno, Madera, San Benito, and Placer Counties (80,082 acres).  The Cometa soils as mapped in Sutter County (11,785 acres) are excluded from the series concept.  They should be mapped as as a different series because the solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 17 inches (A, AB)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 27 inches (Bt)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
