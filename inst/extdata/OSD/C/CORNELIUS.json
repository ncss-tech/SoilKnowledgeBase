  "OVERVIEW": "The Cornelius series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty loess-like materials. Cornelius soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 degrees to 56 degrees F. The depth to the fragipan ranges from 30 to 40 inches. The soil is more than 60 inches deep to bedrock.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is dominantly silty clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Few faint redox concentrations with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 are near the boundary with the fragipan in some pedons. Clay films are common to nearly continuous and faint to distinct on most peds.\nThe 2Btx horizon has matrix colors similar to the horizon above it, but it has faint to prominent redox concentrations with chroma of more than 2 and has tongues with chroma of 2 or less. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and commonly is 2 or more feet thick. This horizon is firm and brittle and has few to many faint to distinct clay films on many peds. It overlies a dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) clay soil in some areas."

The soils formed in loess-like material over mixed, fine-silty old alluvium of mixed origin. The soils formed in a cool moist winter and a warm dry summer climate. Average July temperature is 66 degrees F., average January temperature is 39 degrees F., average annual temperature is 52 degrees to 54 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.
