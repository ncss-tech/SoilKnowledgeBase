  "REVDATE": "07/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chunkmonk series consists of very shallow and shallow to dolomitic limestone, well drained, moderate and moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone. Chunkmonk soils are on dipslopes of cuestas and summits of mesas. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
