Agueda soils, in alluvium from calcareous sedimentary rocks, have carbonates throughout the profile. Conejo soils (MLRA 14, 17), on alluvial fans and stream terraces, are not gravelly in any part of the profile. Gazos soils (MLRA 15, 20), on hills, have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Reward soils (MLRA 15), on uplands, are effervescent and have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Salinas soils, on alluvial plains, fans and terraces, have carbonates below a depth of 22 to 36 inches and have less than 15 percent rock fragments. Westfan soils (MLRA 17), on relict alluvial fans, have Btk and Ck horizons and have less than 15 percent rock fragments."

    "section": "REMARKS",

They are being differentiated from Esparto soils by having a mollic epipedon and no argillic horizon, and from Sorrento soils by having a thick (Pachic) mollic epipedon and are noneffervescent. pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method. Presence of carbonates determined by 10 percent HC1 solution. Organic matter assumed to be greater than 1 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
