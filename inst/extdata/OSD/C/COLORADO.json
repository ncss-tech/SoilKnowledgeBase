  "OVERVIEW": "The Colorado series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils occur on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
