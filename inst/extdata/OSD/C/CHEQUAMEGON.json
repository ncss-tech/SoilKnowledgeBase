    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 70 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, except that it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Redoximorphic features are below the spodic horizon, but are within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within a depth of 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of slightly to highly decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon, up to 5 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and a chroma of 1 to 3. Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. Texture is typically silt loam, but in some pedons is very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has colors and textures like the E horizon described above.\nChequamegon soils have a glossic horizon. Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The 2E part is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.85. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Clay content averages more than 7 percent. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a 2Cd horizon with color and texture like the 2BCd horizon described above."
