    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes. Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  They formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  Sandstone fragments and, in areas where conglomerate is present, chert fragments are commonly part of the colluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

Bolivar soils have a loamy subsoil, are moderately deep to a lithic contact and are on similar positions.  Pomme soils are very deep, fine-loamy and are on strath terraces and footslopes below the Cliquot soils.  Goss soils are very deep, clayey-skeletal and are on side slopes below the Cliquot soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The laboratory data for the type location show that the particle-size control section averages slightly above 60 percent clay, but an average of all pedons sampled indicate that the representative value is less than 60 percent clay.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 10 inches to 55 inches (2Bt and 2BC horizons).\nParalithic contact - soft shale at 55 inches (2Cr horizon).\nIn southwestern Missouri, these soils formed exclusively in materials weathered from sandstone, shale, and cherty conglomerate from the Pennsylvanian geology.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  University of Missouri Soil Characterization Laboratory:  Pedon no.  M9303901.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
