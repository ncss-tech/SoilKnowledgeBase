  "OVERVIEW": "The Cliquot series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone on ridgetops and side slopes.  Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, mean annual precipation is about 42 inches.",

Bolivar soils have a loamy subsoil, are moderately deep to a lithic contact and are on similar positions.  Pomme soils are very deep, fine-loamy and are on strath terraces and footslopes below the Cliquot soils.  Goss soils are very deep, clayey-skeletal and are on side slopes below the Cliquot soils."
