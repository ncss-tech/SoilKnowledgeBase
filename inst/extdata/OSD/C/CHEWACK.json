Thickness of the mixed volcanic ash mantle ranges from 20 to 35 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.

These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and granitic colluvium over ablation till. Precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F. The average annual temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F.
