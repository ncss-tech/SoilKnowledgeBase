  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. from April 1 to October 1 and the soils are dry for 90 or more consecutive days during the same period.   The solum is slightly acid or mildly alkaline in the upper part and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Depth to bedrock or duripan is 60 inches or more.  The solum is 30 to 50 inches thick and has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments, predominantly 2 to 5mm in diameter.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Mollic colors typically extend deeper but organic matter content is less than one percent.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 30 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe C or C2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. It typically has less than 15 percent gravel but may contain thin strata with up to 60 percent gravel.  It is calcareous in some pedons below depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calimus soils are on nearly level to steep lake terraces, terrace escarpments and alluvial fans within basins at elevations of 4,000 to 4,900 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in loamy sediments weathered from diatomite and lava rocks.  The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches but ranges to 16 inches in California.  The mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
