  "REVDATE": "04/2018",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cristal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on concave positions of mountain coves and lower side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains of deeply dissected uplands.  They formed in a mixture of alluvium and colluvium.  Near the type location, the mean annual rainfall is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about  75 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 55 percent.",
