These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It commonly is loam or silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam.  The A horizon is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have received thin layers of overwash material that meet the requirements for mollic epipedon except for thickness.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It commonly is silt loam or light silty clay loam and less commonly loam.  This horizon ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  In some pedons there is a very gravelly loamy sand layer below a depth of 40 inches."
