  "OVERVIEW": "The Chaseburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty and loamy slope alluvium.  These soils are on narrow flood plains, drainageways, foot slopes and toe slopes of hills, and alluvial fans.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The series control section is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and medium acid to neutral in the lower part.  Color, arrangement, and thickness of all horizons are quite variable because of the source of parent material and the method of deposition.  The control section averages between 10 and 18 percent clay.  Channeled phases are recognized in some places.  The profile typically is free of coarse fragments, but some pedons have layers with up to 15 percent gravel and channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 and is 2 to 5 inches thick.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with color similar to the A horizon however, moist color value of 3 has dry value of 6 or more.\nThe C horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam and stratified with very thin layers of coarser textures or different colors.  The entire C horizon has weak horizontal layers as a result of the depositional nature of the deposit.    In some pedons, there is a buried soil below a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arenzville, Hadley, Juneau, and Si series in the same family and the Dorchester, Eudora, Haynie, McPaul, Morganfield, Nodaway, Radford, Terril, and Vicksburg series.  Arenzville soils have an Ab horizon more than 10 inches thick within a depth of 40 inches.  Hadley soils have less than 10 percent clay.  Juneau soils formed in recent colluvium over a buried soil formed in loess or other silty deposits at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Si soils have dominantly yellower hue in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  In addition, Si soils have a much higher annual rainfall that comes mostly during the winter months. Dorchester, Haynie, and McPaul soils have free carbonates in their series control section.  Eudora soils have a mollic epipedon. Morganfield and Vicksburg soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 59 degrees F.  Nodaway soils have a higher clay content in the series control section.  Radford soils have a mollic epipedon and a buried A horizon at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Terril soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon that is cumulic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chaseburg soils are typically on narrow flood plains of deep narrow valleys, in draws, and on foot slopes and toe slopes of hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes commonly are 2 to 6 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in thick, recently deposited silty or loamy alluvium or colluvium.  Frost free period ranges from 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1200 feet.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 33 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Chaseburg soils are closely associated with the competing Arenzville soils and the Orion soils.  The moderately well drained Arenzville and the somewhat poorly drained Orion soils are on nearly level flood plains contiguous to the Chaseburg soils that are situated on the more sloping relief in draws and in the deep, narrow valleys of small feeder-streams.  Orion soils have redox depletions or matrix color with chroma of 1 or less in some part of the sola above 24 inches depth."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Recent pedon descriptions from parent material and landform positions consistent with the Chaseburg series concept indicate that they most likely have a cambic horizon in the recent alluvium and some pedons have an argillic horizon at some depth below 40 inches, however, these would be considered similar soils.\nLow chroma colors in the control section of these soils are the result of the color of the recent parent material and method of deposition. Prior to 1996, the concept of Chaseburg included moderately well drained soils and now it is just well drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  have texture of loamy very fine sand or finer in some subhorizon below a depth of 25 cm but above a depth of 1 m; udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
