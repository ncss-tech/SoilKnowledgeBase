    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to a densic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the silty mantleranges from 0 to 36 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 70 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the silty or loamy mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum. Carbonates are absent within a depth of 60 inches. Redox accumulations are typically throughout the pedon. Redox depletions are on 50 percent or more of ped faces or are 50 percent or more of the matrix in at least the upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon. Saturation occurs at or near the surface much of the year in most years.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or it is neutral in hue. It has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the A or Ap horizon is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon with platy structure and hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Btg horizon with color and texture like the Bg horizon described above. Some pedons with a Btg horizon do not have a Bg horizon.\nThe 2Btg horizon (Btg horizon in pedons without a silty mantle) has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have 2Bt horizons (Bt horizons in pedons without a silty mantle) with like hue and with value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the 2Btg or 2Bt horizon is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. The bulk density ranges from 1.7 to 1.9 g/cm3. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2Cd horizon (Cd horizon in pedons without a silty mantle) has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 4. Texture is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Clay content averages from 7 to 17 percent. The bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.05 g/cm3. Some pedons have pockets, strata, or subhorizons of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a 2Cdg or Cdg horizon with textures, hue and value like the 2Cd and Cd horizons described above, and chroma of 2."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for woodland. Small areas are used for pastureland and a few areas are drained and used for cropland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. common trees are cedar, tamarack, spruce, ash, maple, balsam, aspen, birch, hemlock, and elm. Present vegetation, where the forest cover has been removed, is mostly grasses and sedges with some shrubs, such as alder and willow."
