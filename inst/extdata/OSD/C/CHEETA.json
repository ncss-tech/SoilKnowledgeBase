  "OVERVIEW": "The Cheeta series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from limestone and sandstone.  Cheeta soils are on canyons, cuestas, mesas and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.1 degrees C.",
