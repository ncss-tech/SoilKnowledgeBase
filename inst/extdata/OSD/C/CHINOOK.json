  "STATES": "MT,ND,SD,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from glaciofluvial material, or eolian deposits.  Chinook soils are on alluvial fans, hills, escarpments, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean air annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
