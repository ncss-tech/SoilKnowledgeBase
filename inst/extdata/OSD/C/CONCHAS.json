The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 72 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It is loam or silt loam. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay. The calcic horizon usually is more than 20 percent calcium carbonate."

The soils formed in sediments eroded from red shales and sandstone. Climate is semiarid continental with mean annual precipitation ranging from 14 to 18 inches of which about 2/3 is received from May through September; the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 62 degrees F. The frost-free season is 170 to 190 days."
