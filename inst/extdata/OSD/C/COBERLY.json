  "OVERVIEW": "The Coberly series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone.  Coberly soils are on mesa tops, ridges, and benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The particle size control section is sandy loam or loam, but clay ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout the profile.

The Breece, Chrishall, Dotsero, Hedoes, Klizhin, Parshall, Jarmillo, and Tuntsa soils are very deep.  The Ruso soils are very deep, and have skeletal sandy materials at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Bikeyah soils are very deep and somewhat poorly drained."
