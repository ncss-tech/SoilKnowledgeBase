  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Camroden series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in dense glacial till deposits derived largely from shale and siltstone. These soils are on footslopes and other moderately low areas on glacial till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 44 degrees and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 62 inches. Carbonates are present in the lower part of the substratum in some pedons. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 14 to 21 inches. The upper horizons are typically higher in silt and clay than the fragipan and C horizons, and some pedons have a distinct discontinuity within the upper 30 inches. Rock fragments range from 3 to 25 percent by volume in the upper horizons and from 5 to 35 percent in the fragipan and C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is moderate or weak, medium or fine granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid, unless limed. In undisturbed areas, some pedons have an O, E, and thin Bs horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is very weak, weak, or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe E horizon is lighter in color than the Bw and commonly has platy structure.\nThe Bx horizons has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 in ped interiors. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is coarse or very coarse, prismatic, and is massive or subangular blocky within prisms. Consistence is firm through extremely firm and is slightly brittle or brittle. Redoximorphic features are common or many. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is similar to the Bx horizon in color and texture, but has is less brittle and has fewer redoximorphic features. Structure is platy, or the material is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Norchip series is in the same family. Norchip soils are dominated by rock fragments of sandstone, siltstone, and lesser amounts of shale. The Ontusia and Trussel series were in the same family, but have not been reclassified for CEC reaction class. The Norchip and Ontusia soils are dominated by rock fragments of sandstone, siltstone, and lesser amounts of shale. They also occur in areas of slightly lower rainfall and generally are at slightly higher elevations. Trussel soils formed in colluvium derived from residual soil material, have more angular rock fragments, a lower bulk density in the fragipan, and are at higher elevations.\nThe Brayton, Erie, Marcy, Volusia, and Westbury soils are in related families. Brayton soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section and lack a fragipan. Erie and Volusia soils have a mesic temperature regime. Marcy soils are more poorly drained and lack a layer in the upper part of the solum that has chroma greater than 2 in the matrix or on ped faces. Westbury soils have a spodic horizon and a coarse-loamy particle size control section."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches; mean growing season ranges from 90 to 135 days, and the elevation ranges from 800 to 1800 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was previously classified as a Typic Fragiaquods, but laboratory data and morphology indicates these soils lack a spodic horizon, an thus are reclassified as Aeric Fragiaquepts. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to 7 inches\n(Ap horizon)\n(2) Cambric horizon - the zone from 7 to 15 inches (Bw and E\nhorizons)\n(3) Fragipan - the zone from 15 to 47 inches (Bx1 and Bx2\nhorizons)\n(4) Frigid temperature regime and aquic moisture regime\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Cornell University characterization data is available for pedon S84NY065-6 from Oneida County, New York.  Bulk density measurements for this data appears to be in error.\nSoil Interpretation Record No.: NY0183, NY0184\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
