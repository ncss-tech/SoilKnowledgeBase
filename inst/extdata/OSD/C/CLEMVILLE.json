  "OVERVIEW": "The Clemville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey calcareous alluvial sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in), and Mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",

Change from thermic to hyperthermic temperature regime based geographic distribution of the series. Edited 04-2015 (KBH, JKW) by adding effervescence in range of characteristics, and updating competing series section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon: 31 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in) (Bw horizon)\nFluventic feature: stratification and irregular decrease of organic carbon with depth\nADDITIONAL DATA: Texas Highway Department data on pedons sampled in Brazoria County, TX (S76TX-039-018) and Washington County, TX (S73TX-239-003).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
