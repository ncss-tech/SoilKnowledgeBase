Change from thermic to hyperthermic temperature regime based geographic distribution of the series. Edited 04-2015 (KBH, JKW) by adding effervescence in range of characteristics, and updating competing series section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon: 31 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in) (Bw horizon)\nFluventic feature: stratification and irregular decrease of organic carbon with depth\nADDITIONAL DATA: Texas Highway Department data on pedons sampled in Brazoria County, TX (S76TX-039-018) and Washington County, TX (S73TX-239-003).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
