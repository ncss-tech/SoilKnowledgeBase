  "OVERVIEW": "The Clovis series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in medium and moderately fine textured sediments from quartzite gneiss, schist, sandstone, and limestone.  The Clovis soils are on fan terraces, piedmont slopes, and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured mixed sediments from quartzite, gneiss, schist, sandstone, and limestone.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 7,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid continental. Typically, the mean annual temperature is about 49 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 14 inches, but has ranged to 16 inches in some areas.  Frost-free period is 140 to 185 days.  In Arizona, the mean annual temperature drops to 48 degrees and the frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."
