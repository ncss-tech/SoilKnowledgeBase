  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Average content of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 60 percent in the A horizon and 35 to 70 percent in the B and C horizons.  These consist of gravel and cobbles. A lithologic discontinuity is not present in all pedons.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 1OYR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 1OYR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are loamy sand or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Thin unconforming horizons may have less than 15 percent gravel or cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Craigsville soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on first bottoms along the major streams and their tributaries.  Slope gradients are commonly 1 to 3 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent.  Craigsville soils formed in alluvium washed from sandy and gravelly upland soils that weathered from acid sandstone and quartzite.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Allegheny, Berks, Laidig, and Rushtown soils.  Allegheny soils have an argillic horizon and are on stream terraces.  Berks soils are on uplands and are less than 40 inches deep to fractured shale bedrock.  Laidig soils have a fragipan.  Rushtown soils are silty and contain many fine shale fragments."
