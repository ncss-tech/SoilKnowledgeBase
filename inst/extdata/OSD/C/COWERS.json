  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 36 inches thick.  Bedrock occurs at depths of 40 to more than 60 inches.  The lower B horizon and C horizon contain 20 to 30 percent fine gravel.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 61 to 62 degrees F.  The soils is seasonally dry for 60 to 90 days in the late summer and early fall.  The A 1 horizon has value of 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or moderate fine granular and weak medium platy structure.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard, very friable or friable, nonsticky or slightly sticky, and nonplastic or slightly plastic.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.  The B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Colors darker than 3.5 moist extend to a depth of more than 10 inches.  Organic matter decreases to less than 1 percent at a depth between 10 and 18 inches.  The B2 horizon is light sandy clay loam, light loam, andy loam or cobbly sandy loam.  The cobbles are associated with the moderately deep phase.  The B2 horizon has weak coarse to fine subangular blocky structure.  It is hard or very hard, slightly sticky or sticky, and slightly plastic or plastic when wet.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is gravelly sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, coarse light sandy loam, and coarse sandy clay loam.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard, friable or firm, slightly sticky or sticky, and slightly plastic or plastic.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."
