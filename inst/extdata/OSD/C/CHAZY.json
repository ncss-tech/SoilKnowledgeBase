  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 21 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Redoximorphic features consisting of Fe and clay depletions, and concentrations of Fe-Mn oxides occur within 16 inches of the mineral soil surface. Rock fragments, dominantly of sandstone and granite, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper solum, and moderately acid to neutral below.\nThe Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Unplowed A horizons have value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. It has faint or distinct redox depletions or concentrations. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4, and has faint or distinct redox depletions or concentrations. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or prismatic. Consistence is friable but may be firm in place.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 0 through 2. Faint or distinct redox depletions or concentrations are absent to many. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 with faint or distinct redox depletions or concentrations. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate platy, prismatic or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable but may be firm in place.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4 with faint or distinct redox depletions or concentrations. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate platy, or it is massive. Consistence is friable but may be firm in place."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Jacobsville, Mino, Minnow (T), and Peasleeville series in the same family. Jacobsville and Minnow (T) are not located in Region R. Mino and Peasleeville soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.\nThe Brayton, Cowhorn, Ensley, and Monarda soils are in related families. Brayton and Monarda soils have dense basal till substrata and are very deep. Cowhorn and Ensley soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chazy soils are nearly level and gently sloping soils on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. They are in slight depressions and in areas between sandstone bedrock ridges. The till parent material is derived mainly from sandstone and granite, but also may contain fragments of other sedimentary rock such as dolomite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. Mean frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1800 feet above sea level."

The Irona and Topknot soils are on similar landscape, but are 10 to 20 inches to sandstone bedrock. The Peasleeville and Lyonmounten soils are also on similar landscape but are very deep to bedrock. Moderately well drained Schroon and Sunapee soils occur on nearby more convex landscapes and are very deep."
