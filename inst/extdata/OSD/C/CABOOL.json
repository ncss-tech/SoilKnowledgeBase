Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, the chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe 2R horizon consists of layers of very hard chert and quartzose sandstone."
