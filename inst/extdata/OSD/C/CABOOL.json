  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabool series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. They formed in loess deposited over chert and sandstone bedrock. These soils are on gently sloping upland ridgetops and sideslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
