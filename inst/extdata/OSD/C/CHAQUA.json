    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were mapped as Kettleman and Los Banos in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated from the Kettleman series by having a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, and from the Los Banos series by having a fine-loamy control section and not having an argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - The zone from 0 to 19 inches (A, Btk1horizons)\nCambic Horizon - The zone from 6 to 19 inches (Btk1 horizon)\nCalcic Horizon - The zone from 19 to 35 inches (Btk2, Btk3 horizons). The Merced County, Western Part Soil Survey database should reflect the calcium carbonate equivalent percent for the A and Btk1 horizons as 5 to 15 percent and for the Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons as 10 to 25 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent percent was not an entry on the SCS-5 when this soil survey was completed.\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area."
