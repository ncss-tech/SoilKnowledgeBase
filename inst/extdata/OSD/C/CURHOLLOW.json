Ustic aridic moisture regime.\nSoil temperature - 54 to 58 degrees F.\nMean summer soil temperature - 71 to 76 degrees F.\nDepth to thin petrocalcic horizon - 10 to 20 inches.\nControl section - Clay content: averages 18 to 27 percent; Fine sand or coarser content: 40 to 60 percent;\nRock fragments: 35 to 90 percent, mainly pebbles and cobbles. Lithology of fragments is typically sedimentary rocks such as limestone or sandstone.\nReaction - Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nA horizon\nHue: 5YR to 10YR.\nValue: 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist.\nRock fragments: 25 to 85 percent.\nBk horizons\nHue: 5YR to 10YR.\nValue: 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist.\nChroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly silt loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.\nRock fragments: 35 to 90 percent, mainly pebbles and cobbles.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Carbonates commonly coat undersides of rock fragments, but may be disseminated in the horizon matrix.\nEffervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 30 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Childers soils have 5 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contacts underlying the petrocalcic horizon. Havasupai soils have extremely gravelly sand below the hardpan. Pibler soils have a xeric moisture pattern and include very shallow depths to hardpan. Pinetown soils do not have bedrock within 25 inches and have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F."

Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 6,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 76 to 79 degrees F.  The frost free period is 135 to 170 days."
