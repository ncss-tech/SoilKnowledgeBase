  "OVERVIEW": "The Coesse series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of recent alluvium over a buried fine textured soil formed in lacustrine deposits on moraines and till plains.  It is moderately slowly permeable.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The moderately well drained Glynwood, Saylesville, and St. Clair soils and the well drained Morley soils are on the more sloping areas at higher elevations.  The very poorly drained Milford and Pewamo soils are in similar positions on the landscape but do not have the deposits of recent alluvium eroded from soils at higher elevations."
