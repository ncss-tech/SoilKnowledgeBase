The somewhat poorly drained Blount, Del Rey, and Fulton soils are on slightly higher elevations of the landscape. The moderately well drained Glynwood, Saylesville, and St. Clair soils and the well drained Morley soils are on the more sloping areas at higher elevations.  The very poorly drained Milford and Pewamo soils are in similar positions on the landscape but do not have the deposits of recent alluvium eroded from soils at higher elevations."

Ponding in winter and early spring often damages winter wheat and deep rooted legumes.  Some undrained areas are used for pasture or woodlots.  Native vegetations was water tolerant deciduous forest with some swamp grasses and sedges."
