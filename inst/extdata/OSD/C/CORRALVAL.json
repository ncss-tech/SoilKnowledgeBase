  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Corralval soils are on alluvial fans and low stream terraces on mountain valleys.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources including granodiorite, tuff, andesite, and some quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 7,500 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
