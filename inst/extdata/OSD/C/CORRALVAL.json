  "OVERVIEW": "The Corralval series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Corralval soils are on alluvial fans and low stream terraces on mountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
