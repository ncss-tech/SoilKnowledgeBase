  "OVERVIEW": "The Colby series consists of very deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loess. Colby soils are on plains and hillslopes on tableland in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 5 percent in the upper part of the profile.\nThe A horizon or Ap (where present):\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3\nHorizons having value of 5 or less dry or 3 or less moist and a chroma of 3 or less are less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) thick.\nTexture: silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam\nReaction: mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nThe AC and C horizons:\nHue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR\nValue: 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nTexture: silt loam or loam\nReaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline\nVisible accumulation of carbonates in the C1 horizon occur as films on ped faces or soft masses.  It is not a calcic horizon, and the horizon is not regarded as definitive for the series."
