    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe thickness of the solum ranges from 8 to 30 centimeters (3 to 12 inches).\nParticle-size control section: 19 to 34 percent clay by weighted average\nTypically these soils have free carbonates at the surface, but some pedons are carbonate free in the upper 15 centimeters (6 inches).  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 5 percent in the upper part of the profile.\nThe A horizon or Ap (where present):\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3\nHorizons having value of 5 or less dry or 3 or less moist and a chroma of 3 or less are less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) thick.\nTexture: silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam\nReaction: mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nThe AC and C horizons:\nHue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR\nValue: 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nTexture: silt loam or loam\nReaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline\nVisible accumulation of carbonates in the C1 horizon occur as films on ped faces or soft masses.  It is not a calcic horizon, and the horizon is not regarded as definitive for the series."
