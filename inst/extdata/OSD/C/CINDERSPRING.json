Fren soils have 15 to 30 percent volcanic ash, do not have dominate silty materials in the upper particle-size control section, and have secondary carbonates at a depth of 50 to 90 cm. Iver soils do not have cinders in the particle size control section. Kabear soils have 4 to 14 percent clay and less than 5 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Lobert soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper half of their particle-size control sections, average less than 15 percent rock fragments, and have weak durinodes in the lower part of the B or in the C horizon. Ola soils have a paralithic contact to granitic bedrock within depths of 100 cm. Redmount soils do not have a cambic horizon and have a very gravelly sandy loam 2C horizon. Shively soils do not have a cambic horizon, or dominantly silty materials in the upper particle-size control section, and have a paralithic contact at depths of 100 to 150 cm. Stripe soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact. Taterpa soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to paralithic contact. Wagore soils formed in colluvium from granite and do not have dominantly silty materials in the particle size control section."
