  "OVERVIEW": "The Cliffdown series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Cliffdown soils are on fan remnants, fan aprons, fan skirts, inset fans, and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
