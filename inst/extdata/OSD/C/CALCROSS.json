In 6 or more out of 10 years, the moisture control section is continually dry in all parts for 60 to 75 days during the summer, and continually moist in all parts for 60 to 75 days during the winter and early spring.\nThe particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is dominantly silty clay loam or silt loam with strata of very fine sandy loam or loam. This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Some pedons have gypsum in this horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, shale, limestone and some igneous rocks. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 67 to 72 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The freeze-free period is 110 to 140 days."

Ashdown and Bandag soils are fine-loamy.  Wales and Woodrow soils are on flood plains downslope of the Calcross soils. They have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth. In addition, Wales soils are fine-loamy. Woodrow soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR below the surface layer."

The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab sample number S72UT-021-013.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
