  "OVERVIEW": "The Catto series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderate over moderately slowly permeable bedrock. The soils formed from chert bedrock. They are on strongly sloping to steep hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

Slopes are dominantly 12 to 30 percent but range from 5 to 60 percent.  Rock outcrops are common along ridges.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 61 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Bullis soils have sola greater than 60 inches, and have clayey particle size control sections.  Bullis soils are on lower footslope positions.  Buckear soils are on similar positions in the landscape.  Coyanosa soils are on adjacent sandstone mountains and hills.  Sanderson soils are very deep and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Sanderson soils are in valleys and on foot slopes.  Stovall soils are very deep soils, and do not contain rock fragments.  Stovall soils are in adjacent valleys and broad flats.  Upton soils are shallow over a petrocalcic horizon and are on adjacent hills and ridges."
