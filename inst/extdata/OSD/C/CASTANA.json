  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Castana series consists of very deep, well drained soils on footslopes. These soils formed in silty local alluvium and colluvium from loess.  Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
