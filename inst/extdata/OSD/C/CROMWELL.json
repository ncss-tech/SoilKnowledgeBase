  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the coarse-loamy upper sediment and the depth to loamy sand or coarser ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Rock fragments, which is of mixed lithology, but mostly of igneous origin, ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy sediment, and 0 to 35 percent in the sandy substratum.  The gravel is less than 1 cm in diameter.  The particle-size control section averages loamy sand or coarser textures.  The upper sediment contains more than 50 percent fine and coarser sands.   Reaction in the solum ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid with the more acid conditions occurring only in the upper part of the solum.\nSome pedons have a 0 horizon as much as 2 inches thick.  It is a mat of slightly to highly decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizons and 2Bw horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, with value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bw horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.  In some pedons, the lower 2 inches or less have some clay bridges between sand grains and/or thin patchy clay films on faces of peds, (Bt horizons).  However, clay bridges or films are discontinuous within the limits of a pedon.  The 2Bw horizon has texture of sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  It is sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Thin layers of fine sand are in some pedons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."
