  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the hard fragmental limestone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Base retention is 10 meq. or less/100 grams of clay but more than 1 meq. in all subhorizons of the oxic horizon.  CEC is 16 meq. or less per 100 grams of clay.  Organic matter content is less than 20 kilograms in a volume 1 meter square to a depth of 1 meter.  Base saturation is 35 percent or more in all subhorizons to the contact with the hard limestone.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or higher.  Texture is clay.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard indurated limestone bedrock.  The limestone may be weathered in a layer 2 to 4 inches in some pedons, but has rock structure that is root limiting."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Matanzas series is the only known series in the same family.  Matanzas soils are on similar positions, have redder Bo horizons, have higher content of iron oxides, and are deep to limestone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cotito soils are on foot slopes and valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in regolith consisting of fine-textured sediments that washed from the surrounding limestone hills.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 62 to 70 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 77 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Matanzes in addition to the Aceitunas and Tanama series.  Aceituna soils are on similar positions, have redder and more acid subsoils, and are very deep to bedrock.  Tamana soils are on similar to higher positions, and are shallow to hard limestone bedrock."

The previous OSED was dated 4/67.  This draft reflects a change in classification from: Clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Lithic Kandiustox to:  Clayey kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Lithic Eutrustox.\nThis soil was formerly included in the Coto series but differs from it in being shallower to the limestone rock.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
