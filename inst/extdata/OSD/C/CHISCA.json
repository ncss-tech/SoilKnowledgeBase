    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches and depth to soft alkaline shale bedrock ranges from 40 to\n60 inches.  In some pedons thin layers of channery limestone\noverlie the shale bedrock.  Reaction of the A, Bt, and BC or CB horizons is extremely acid to strongly acid except where the\nsurface layer has been limed.  The C horizon is very strongly acid\nto moderately alkaline.  The Cr horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma\nof 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy\nloam, silty clay loam, clay loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly\nloam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E or BE horizon less than 5 inches thick with\nhue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nTexture is the same as the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value\nof 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8\nwith common to many mottles in shades of red, gray, or brown; or\nit is mottled in varying shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  Texture of the Bt horizon is clay.  Some pedons have a thin layer\nof silty clay or silty clay loam in the upper part of the Bt\nhorizon.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y,\nvalue of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with common to many mottles\nin varying shades or red, gray, or brown; or it is mottled in\nvarying shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray.  Texture is clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to\n7, and chroma of 1 to 6 with common to many mottles in varying\nshades or red, gray, or brown; or it is mottled in varying shades\nof yellow, brown, red, or gray.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Percent by volume of cobbles, channers, or flagstones of limestone range from 0 to 10 percent, percent by volume of gravel or\nchannery of shale range from 0 to 50 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered alkaline shale.  Some pedons contain channers or flagstones of limestone."
