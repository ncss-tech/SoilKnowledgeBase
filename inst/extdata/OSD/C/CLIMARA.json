  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean soil temperature is about 59 to 65 degrees F. The soils have cracks more than 1 mm wide to a depth of 20 inches or more.  The cracks are open from about May until December and remain closed the rest of the year. Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. Gravel, cobbles and stones are present in some pedons, particularly in or near the surface but constitute less than 35 percent of the volume.  The average calcium/magnesium ratio is about 2.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/2; 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2 or N 5/0. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 2/1, 3/1, 3/2; 5Y 3/1, 3/2 or N 3/0. Texture is clay loam, stony clay or clay. Structure is usually granular or fine blocky in the upper few inches. Some diagonal ped faces are usually present in the lower part. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline and alkalinity generally increases with depth.\nThe Bss horizon has color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 4/3, 5/2, 6/4; 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 3/3, 4/4; 5Y 3/2, 4/4, 5/1 or 5/6. Clay content is 40 to 60 percent. Intersecting slickensides are present in some part.\nThe Bkss and/or Bk horizon has color of 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 6/4; 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/4; 5Y 3/2 or 5/1. Texture is silty clay loam, gravelly clay or clay. Some pedons have intersecting slickensides. Segregated carbonates occur as seams, filaments or soft masses."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Climara soils are on mountains and uplands. Slope is 9 to 50 percent. These soils formed in mass movement deposits derived from Franciscan melange serpentine, serpentinite, graywacke, chert, gabbro and blue schist and other ultrabasic rocks with low Ca/Mg ratios. Elevation is 500 to 3,860 feet. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 24 inches. Mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F; mean January temperature is about 46 degrees F;mean July temperature is about 80 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 200 to 250 days."

Maymen soils, on hills and mountains, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Millsholm soils, on hills and mountains, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Montara soils, on uplands and ridge tops, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Toomes soils, on ridges and plateaus, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."
