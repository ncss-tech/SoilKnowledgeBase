The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments with 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 1 to 4 dry.  The C horizon may be calcareous.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carney series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils on fans and hillslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from tuffs and breccias.  Elevation is 1,200 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent."

All of the above soils except for Coker, Padigan and Phoenix lack the intersecting slickensides.  Brader and McMullin soils are less then 20 inches deep.  Medco soils have mollic epipedon.  Coker and Phoenix soils have dominant chromas of less than 1.5 in the upper 12 inches. Debenger soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the control section. Heppsie soils have a mollic epipedon.  Cove and Padigan soils are poorly drained."
