Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. There is more than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle size control section. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It generally is loamy fine sand and ranges to loamy sand and fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles are few or common and have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It commonly is loamy fine sand and ranges to loamy sand and fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5. Those horizons with matrix chroma of 3 or more have 2 or less chroma mottles. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fisherman, Seabrook, and Voss series in the same family and the similar Canalou series. Fisherman soils have less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the control section and are inundated by salt water. Seabrook soils have yellowish hues in the lower C horizons and have distinct concretions throughout the control section, 1/8 to 2 inches in diameter. Voss soils have a mean annual soil temperature of over 68 degrees F. Canalou soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clana soils occur on flat to slightly convex natural levees or terraces. Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in sandy alluvium of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers under the influence of a fluctuating water table. The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 65 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches."

Broseley soils have argillic horizons and occur on undulating and sloping levees or terraces above Clana soils. Diehlstadt and Sikeston soils have thick mollic epipedons and occur in depressions or old stream channels below Clana soils. Lilbourn soils are coarse-loamy and occur on nearly level to depressional areas. Malden and Scotco soils do not have 2 chroma mottles and occur on the higher parts of the natural levees and the side slopes."
