  "OVERVIEW": "The Clana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium on old natural levees and terraces. These soils have rapid permeability and slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. There is more than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle size control section. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It generally is loamy fine sand and ranges to loamy sand and fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles are few or common and have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It commonly is loamy fine sand and ranges to loamy sand and fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5. Those horizons with matrix chroma of 3 or more have 2 or less chroma mottles. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand."

Fisherman soils have less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the control section and are inundated by salt water. Seabrook soils have yellowish hues in the lower C horizons and have distinct concretions throughout the control section, 1/8 to 2 inches in diameter. Voss soils have a mean annual soil temperature of over 68 degrees F. Canalou soils are coarse-loamy."

Broseley soils have argillic horizons and occur on undulating and sloping levees or terraces above Clana soils. Diehlstadt and Sikeston soils have thick mollic epipedons and occur in depressions or old stream channels below Clana soils. Lilbourn soils are coarse-loamy and occur on nearly level to depressional areas. Malden and Scotco soils do not have 2 chroma mottles and occur on the higher parts of the natural levees and the side slopes."
