  "BYREV": "Rev. GA; RER; RLV; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "03/2005",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caracoles series consists of very shallow, well drained, moderate to moderately rapidly permeable soils on side slopes and summits of small hills.  They formed in material that weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.",
