  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the hard limestone is over 40 inches.  Consistence is slightly sticky and slightly plastic in the Bo horizons.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid in the whole profile.  Bases plus aluminum meq/100 grams of clay range from 2.7 to 4.7 in the oxic horizon.  CEC, by Nh4OAC, ranges from 7 to 15.0 meq/100 grams of clay in the oxic horizon.  Base saturation by NH4OAC, in the upper part of the oxic horizon ranges from 20 to 34 percent.  Some part of the oxic horizon has thin patchy films or reflective ped surfaces with pressure induced clay orientation.  The mean annual soil temperature is 76 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 5YR or 7.5YR and values and chroma of 3 to 4.  Texture is clay or sandy clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe upper Bo horizons have hues of 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay.  Structure is weak to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  The lower Bo horizons have hues of 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 6 to 8.  Red mottles may or may not be present.  Structure of the lower Bo horizon is weak fine to coarse or structureless (erosive)."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Bayamon, Catalina, Cotito, Delicias, Hanamaulu, Kapaa, Kunuweia, Lawai, Makopili, Matanzas, Nipe, Pooku, Puhi, and Rosario series are similar soils in related families.  The Bayamon and Delicias soils are more strongly weathered.  The Catalina soils are redder, with color in hues of 2.5YR and redder, and have clay mineralogy dominated by oxides of iron.  The Cotito, Matanzas, and Puhi soils have base saturation values higher than 35 percent in all parts of the oxic horizon.  The Hanamaulu, Lawai and Makopili soils have an umbric surface horizon. The Kapaa and Pooku soils have sheets that contain 30 percent or more gibbsite.  The Kunuweia and Nipe soils are extremely weathered and have much lower cation retention values.  The Rosario soils have serpentine rock within 40 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Coto soils are gently to moderately sloping soils on foot slopes and valleys adjacent to the limestone hills on slope gradients of 2 to 12 percent.  They formed in fine textured sediments derived from limestone.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 67 to 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F."
