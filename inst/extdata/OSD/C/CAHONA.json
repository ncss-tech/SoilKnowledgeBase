  "OVERVIEW": "The Cahona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone.  Cahona soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
