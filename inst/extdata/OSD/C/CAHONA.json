Change results from the Four Corners Climate Conference of 10/92.  Type location was moved to better reflect the central concept of the Cahona series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 5 to 25 inches.  (Bt, Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 25 to 60 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2)\nParticle size control section: The zone from 5 to 25 inches. (Bt, Btk)\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
