  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Below the plow layer, bedding planes and weak horizontal stratification are evident throughout the soil. Weak subangular blocky structure is in the upper part of the C horizon in some pedons but occupies less than 1/2 of the volume. Reaction of the soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid in all horizons. The 10- to 40-inch control section has from 5 to 18 percent clay. Sand content is as much as 30 percent but less than 15 percent is coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 and 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. The A horizon commonly is silt loam; less commonly it is loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Few to many iron depletions having chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 20 inches of the surface and commonly begin at a depth of about 16 inches. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe lower part of the C horizon is variegated in shades of brown and gray, or it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less. Iron accumulations are few to many in shades of brown and iron depletions are in shades of gray."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Closely related series include the Adler, Ariel, Bruin, Falaya, Iuka, Morganfield, and Vicksburg series. Adler soils are slightly acid to alkaline. Ariel and Bruin soils have a cambic horizon; In addition, Bruin soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Falaya soils have aquic conditions and matrix chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches and have a buried subsoil. Iuka soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Morganfield and Vicksburg soils do not have aquic conditions or iron depletions with chroma 2 or less within a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Morganfield soils are slightly acid to alkaline."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The regolith consists principally of silty alluvium derived from loess. Average annual temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit, mean January and July temperatures are 45 degrees Fahrenheit and 82 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively, and average annual precipitation is 50 inches near the type location."

Arkabutla and Cascilla soils have a fine-silty particle size class and have a cambic horizon. In addition, Arkabutla soils have aquic conditions within a depth of 20 inches and are on slightly lower positions, and Cascilla soils are on natural levee positions near stream channels.  Waverly soils have aquic conditions within a depth of 20 inches, have a grayish matrix below the A horizon and are in the drainageways and depressions. Well drained Vicksburg soils are on natural levees and near channels."
