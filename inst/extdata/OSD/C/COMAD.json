  "OVERVIEW": "The Comad series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, alluvium, colluvium or alpine till derived from gneiss, schist, granite and quartzite rock.  These soils are on hills, mountains, alluvial fans, stream terraces and moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
