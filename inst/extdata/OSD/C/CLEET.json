Deepeek and Shinnpeak soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Hotcreek and Malmesa soils have lithic contacts at depths of less than 50 cm from the soil surface.  Indicove soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms; particle-size control section with 50 to 75 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel of quartzite lithology. Lapon soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have lithic contacts at depths of 38 to 100 cm from the soil surface. Oleman soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 14 degrees C. Troughs soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm from the soil surface.
