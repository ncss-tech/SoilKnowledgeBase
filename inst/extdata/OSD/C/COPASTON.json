  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The upper mantle typically does not have free carbonates, but a small amount is in the lower part of some pedons.  The upper mantle contains 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The rock fragments are limestone.  The average clay content in the upper mantle ranges from 14 to 30 percent.  The reaction of the upper mantle is moderately acid to neutral but includes slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  In some pedons the lower part of the B horizon has few faint clay films.  Typically, the boundary between the upper mantle and the bedrock is abrupt, but a thin layer of disintegrated rock or less than 2 inches of discontinuous residuum is at the contact in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Copaston soils have plane or convex slopes on bedrock controlled terraces and on uplands. These soils formed in a mantle of glacial drift or alluvial material that overlies limestone bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is ranges from 24 to 34 inches.  Frost free days range from 124 to 160 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1200 feet."

Faxon and Joliet soils are poorly drained.  Bedrock begins at depths of less than 20 inches in the Joliet soils and at depths of 20 to 40 inches in the Faxon soils. Rockton soils have argillic horizons and bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

With this revision, it is restricted to limestone bedrock only.  The Bechyn series was established for areas of igneous and metamorphic bedrock.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 1070 for results of some laboratory analyses of the typical pedon.
