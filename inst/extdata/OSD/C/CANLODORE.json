The control section is 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe E horizon has a hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and a chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon may or may not meet the requirements of an albic horizon.\nThe B horizon, when present, has a hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and a chroma of 4 through 6.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has a hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very cobbly loamy sand or very cobbly sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Alflack, Castlepeak, Chena, Chenega, Cryomont, Graylock, Howardsville, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Polepatch, Stecum, and Studebaker do not have E horizons.  Ovando soils contain lamellae.  Alflack soils also have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Mirror Lake soils have strong or very strongly acid soil reactions in the Bw and C horizons."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 75 days.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 9,200 feet."
