  "OVERVIEW": "The Canlodore series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial deposits derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Canlodore soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

This horizon may or may not meet the requirements of an albic horizon.\nThe B horizon, when present, has a hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and a chroma of 4 through 6.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has a hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very cobbly loamy sand or very cobbly sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Alflack, Castlepeak, Chena, Chenega, Cryomont, Graylock, Howardsville, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Polepatch, Stecum, and Studebaker do not have E horizons.  Ovando soils contain lamellae.  Alflack soils also have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Mirror Lake soils have strong or very strongly acid soil reactions in the Bw and C horizons."
