  "OVERVIEW": "The Canlodore series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial deposits derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Canlodore soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
