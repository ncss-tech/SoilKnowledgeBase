  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches and depth\nto hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Channers, gravels, and flagstones\nof phyllite, slate, or other fine grained metasedimentary rocks  range from 15\nto 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 15 to 50 percent by volume in the\nC horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons\nwith value 3 have a thickness of less than 7 inches.  Texture of the fine earth\nis silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6,  Texture\nof the fine earth is silt loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Few or\ncommon mottles in shades of gray or brown may be present.  Texture of the fine\nearth is silt loam or loam.\nTransitional horizons occur between the major horizons in many pedons.  They\nhave properties and features similar to adjacent horizons."

They formed in colluvium from metasedimentary rocks\nincluding phyllite, slate, and slightly metamorphosed shale, siltstone, or\nsandstone."

Brasstown, Junaluska, and Keener soils have argillic horizons.\nBrookshire and Jeffrey soils have dark surface horizons with color value and\nchroma of 3 or less 7 to 10 inches thick.  Cataska soils have a paralithic\ncontact within 20 inches.  Ditney and Soco soils have a lithic contact between\n20 and 40 inches and are in coarse-loamy families.  Soco soils have a paralithic\ncontact between 20 and 40 inches.  Maymead soils are in a coarse-loamy family.\nSpivey soils have an umbric epipedon.  Unicoi soils are in a loamy-skeletal\nfamily and have a lithic contact within 20 inches."
