Undisturbed areas have A horizons 2 to 5 inches in thickness with value of 3.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral depending upon liming practices.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 to 3.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.

The somewhat poorly drained Bethalto and Edwardsville soils are in similar landform positions further from the drainageways.  The Bethalto soils have a thin, dark surface layer and the Edwardsville soils have a mollic epipedon.  The Bethalto and Edwardsville soils form a biosequence with the Caseyville soils.  The well drained Menfro soils and the moderately well drained Winfield soils are on more sloping landform positions nearby and they form a hydrosequence with the Caseyville soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Caseyville soils were formerly included with the Iva and Stronghurst series.  Iva soils are considered to contain more illite clay minerals and less smectite clay minerals than Caseyville soils.  It is not known if data is available to confirm this assumption.  Some data is available for Iva soils in Indiana that show the sand content to be 5-8 percent in the lower part of the series control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 16 inches (Ap, Eg, and BE horizons).  Albic horizon - the zone from 7 to 12 inches (Eg horizon).   Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 16 to 54 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
