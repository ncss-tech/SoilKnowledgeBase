Some Colchones taxadjuncts may classify similar to Majaguas due to not having a thick organic material surface.\nOstiones soils--do not have organic horizons and occur on submerged mainland beach landforms adjacent to mainland coves.\nPlaceres soils--have a skeletal control section and lack diagnostic organic horizons. Placeres occur in distinctly different estuarine tidal stream landforms and closer to the mangrove margins."
