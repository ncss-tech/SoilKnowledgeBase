  "OVERVIEW": "The Callville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from gypsiferous sandstone and siltstone. Callville soils are on pediments. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

Selected chemical properties such as soil reaction (pH), electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), gypsum content, and water soluble ions were determined. USU Sample # 2719-2722, 1997.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 7/2006. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
