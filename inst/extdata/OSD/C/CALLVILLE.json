    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The active cation exchange activity class is estimated. Laboratory data is needed to confirm this placement. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 2 inches (Ay horizon).\nGypsic horizon - 2 to 25 inches (By1 and By2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - 25 inches (Cr horizon).\nLithic contact  43 inches (R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - 10 to 25 inches (By2 horizon and part of the By1 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon of Callville was reference sampled and analyzed at the Utah State University Analytical Laboratories. Selected chemical properties such as soil reaction (pH), electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), gypsum content, and water soluble ions were determined. USU Sample # 2719-2722, 1997.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 7/2006. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
