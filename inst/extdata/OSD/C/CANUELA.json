    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canuela soils are on summits and beveled summits of interfluves on undulating plateaus and mesas. They formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 2 to 6 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 2 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 15 inches. (Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - at 15 inches. (2Cr layer)\nNote: This soil has moderate amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt plus sand fractions.  It has less volcanic ash than other nearby less developed soils because of the influence of introduced eolian materials. Even though lower horizons contain more glass than upper horizons, it does not contain enough glass to make a Vitritorrandic subgroup.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
