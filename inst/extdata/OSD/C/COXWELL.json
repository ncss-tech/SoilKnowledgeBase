Coxwell soils are on ridges along mountain toe slopes and have slopes of 5 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,000.   The alluvial sediments are derived from weathered granite. The mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The frost-free season is 185 to 200 days."
