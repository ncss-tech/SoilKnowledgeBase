  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Coxwell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvial sediments over weathered granitic bedrock.  Coxwell soils are on ridges along mountain toe slopes and have slopes of 5 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",
