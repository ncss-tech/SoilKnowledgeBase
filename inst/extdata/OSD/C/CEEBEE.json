    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ceebee soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,390 to 3,520 meters. The climate is humid with cold, wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
