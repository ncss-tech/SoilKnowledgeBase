  "OVERVIEW": "The Ceebee series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Ceebee soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
