  "OVERVIEW": "The China series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",

Cracks remain open for less than 60 cumulative days during most years.\nSlickensides and wedge shaped peds begin at a depth ranging from 20 to 44 cm (8 to 17 in).
