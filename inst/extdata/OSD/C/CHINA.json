Cracks remain open for less than 60 cumulative days during most years.\nSlickensides and wedge shaped peds begin at a depth ranging from 20 to 44 cm (8 to 17 in).  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 in) higher than microdepressions.  Distance from center of the microknoll to center of microdepression ranges from 1 to 3.7 m (3 to 12 ft). Microknolls make up 5 to 25 percent of the pedon.  Typically, colors in the microknoll have higher value than the microdepressions.  Calcium carbonate concretions, mainly in clusters, range from 1 to 5 percent in the lower part of the microknoll in some pedons.\nSoil Moisture: A udic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts for more than 275 days in normal years.

Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have episaturation from 47 to 122 cm (18 to 48 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation from 153 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period."
