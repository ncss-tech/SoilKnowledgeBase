    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cavelt soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in stratified fan alluvium from mixed acid and basic rock and eolian deposits.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 2,700 feet.  Cavelt soils are in a hot, arid and continental climate.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 75 degrees F.  Precipitation occurs as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
