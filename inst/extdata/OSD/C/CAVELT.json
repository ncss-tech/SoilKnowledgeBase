  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavelt series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils over an indurated calcium carbonate-cemented hardpan.  Cavelt soils formed in fan alluvium.  Cavelt soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F.",

These soils formed in stratified fan alluvium from mixed acid and basic rock and eolian deposits.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 2,700 feet.  Cavelt soils are in a hot, arid and continental climate.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 75 degrees F.  Precipitation occurs as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
