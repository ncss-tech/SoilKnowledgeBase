  "OVERVIEW": "The Cattcreek series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in dacitic pumice and volcanic ash over colluvium from andesite and glacial till.  Cattcreek soils are on mountain slopes and cirque basins at elevations of 2,800 to 5,300 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
