The upper profile formed in aerially deposited dacitic pumice and volcanic ash from Mt. St.  Helens.  The lower part of the profile formed in  colluvium, alluvium or glacial till from andesite with an admixture of pumice and volcanic ash.   Mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches including considerable snow.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 70 to 140 days."
