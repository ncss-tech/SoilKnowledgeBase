  "OVERVIEW": "The Cablon series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in outwash derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and sedimentary rock.  Cablon soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
