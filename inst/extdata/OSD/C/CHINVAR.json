The soil between 8 and 24 inches is moist in all parts from January 1 to May 1 and dry in all parts from July 1 to November 1.  The water table fluctuates between 36 and 60 inches of the surface during December through March.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 5 to 14 and is generally higher in the underlying material than in the surface.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 or 4/4.  Color values higher than 5.5 dry or 3.5 moist and chromas higher than 3.5 moist are in mixed colors, but are of minor extent.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 27 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Sorrento fine sandy loam in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by being somewhat poorly drained and having an aquic intergraded moisture regime.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Soluble salts and exchangeable sodium determined by saturation extract.  Organic carbon determined by Walkely-Black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
