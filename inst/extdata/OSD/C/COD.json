These soils formed in alluvium predominantly from limestone and granite.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to March.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days."
