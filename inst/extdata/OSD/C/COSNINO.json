Caster and Paunsaugunt soils are calcareous throughout.  Celeste, Firo, Moonset, Nivean, Paunsaugunt, Vershal, and Wuby soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Highpark and Nivean soils are formed in volcanic breccia and have vitrandic soil properties.  Catgulch soils are formed in granite and have paralithic bedrock over unweathered bedrock.  Duffymont soils have an Aridic Ustic soil moisture regime.  Whitlash soils have less than 35 percent sand in the control section."

Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and or residuum derived from limestone or sandstone. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches (457 to 559 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as snow December to February. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 to 7.7 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
