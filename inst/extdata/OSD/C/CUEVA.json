Durango, Fikel, Hosta, Montecito, Prater, and Teco soils are all deep or very deep to a bedrock contact. Erramouspe, Paguate, and Tinian soils are over a lithic contact. Hualapai soils do not have secondary calcium carbonates, are warmer, and are weathered from granite. Jacee, Nogal, and Wilmac soils have more yellow hues and in addition, the Jacee soil has a calcic horizon."

The soils formed in sandstone and shale with stones, boulders, and rock outcrops occurring in some areas. Average annual precipitation is about 14 to 17 inches with the average temperature ranging from 46 to 48 degrees F. The climate is semiarid, continental with a frost-free period of about 120 to 140 days. The annual precipitation pattern is characterized by a marked summer maximum."

The Glorieta soils are very deep, have an abrupt textural change from the surface to the Bt horizon, and occur on footslopes and toeslopes of scarps and hills. The Ribera soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to a lithic contact, and occur on summits of structural benches."
