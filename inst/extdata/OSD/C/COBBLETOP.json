  "OVERVIEW": "The Cobbletop series consists of very deep moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium (outwash).  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
