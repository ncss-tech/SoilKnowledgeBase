  "OVERVIEW": "The Charwell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash.  Charwell soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
