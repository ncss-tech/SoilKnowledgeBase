These soils formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,740 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days."
