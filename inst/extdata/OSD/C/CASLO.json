  "OVERVIEW": "The Caslo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments form in mixed rock sources.  The Caslo soils are on flood plains of basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
