    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 13 to 60 inches. They are mixed in lithology and are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter. Redoximorphic features occur at depths between 20 and 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand or sand. The gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. They are strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, sandy clay loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume. It is neutral or slightly acid. There is 2 to 4 times as much clay in the Bt part as in the adjacent E material.\nThe E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have E and Bt horizons with 1/8 to 2 1/2 inch thick lamellae.\nThe BC horizon has hue 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand, coarse sand, fine sand or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, or their gravelly analogues.

Aylmer, Hiwood, Lino, Meehan, Poppelton, Redby, Rushlake, and Winterfield soils do not have a thin zone of clay accumulation (Bt) in the series control section. In addition, Aylmer, Hiwood and Lino soils do not have free carbonates above 40 inches. Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth."
