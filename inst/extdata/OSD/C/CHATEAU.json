These soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Most of this soil has been leveled but was gently sloping and hummocky in its natural relief. Elevation is 110 to 185 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. Frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

Dosamigos soils, on low alluvial fans adjacent to the valley basin rim, have a mollic epipedon. Santanela and Turlock soils, on valley basins, have a natric horizon and a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Triangle soils, on valley basins, have intersecting slickensides and develop wide cracks when dry."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as the Lethent series in the Los Banos Area, California 1939 Series Report. They differ by not having an argillic horizon and having a xeric moisture regime.\nVery slow runoff terminology adjusted to read negligible, low or medium, to comply with adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual dated 10/93.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric Epipedon (0 to 15 inches) - The organic matter is less than 1 percent and the thickness ranges from 7 to 23 inches.\n2. Cambic Horizon (15 to 23 inches) - Moist color drops 1 unit in hue, 2 units in value, and 2 units in chroma (sesquioxides-gleying). Clay content increases 2 to 5 percent but does not qualify as an argillic horizon.\n3. Aquic Subgroup - Formed under aquic conditions but now is protected. Profile still saturated for a short period of time by water table and stagnant surface water. These soils have an aquic moisture regime, but do not have moist chromas of 2 in the matrix directly under the epipedon within a depth of 20 inches that would qualify them for the Aquept suborder."
