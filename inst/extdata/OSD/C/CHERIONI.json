  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cherioni series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan and bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium on volcanic bedrock.  Cherioni soils are on fan terraces or hills and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

These soils formed in fan alluvium on pyroclastic and metamorphic rocks.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches; about one-half of which falls during summer thunderstorms during the months of July, August and September.  Average January air temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the average July air temperature is about 91 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 67 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."
