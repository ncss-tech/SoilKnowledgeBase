  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cherioni soils are on hills and fan terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 150 to 3000 feet.  These soils formed in fan alluvium on pyroclastic and metamorphic rocks.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches; about one-half of which falls during summer thunderstorms during the months of July, August and September.  Average January air temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the average July air temperature is about 91 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 67 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."
