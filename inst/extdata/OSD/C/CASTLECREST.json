  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 14 to 30 inches thick.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has andic soil properties throughout and have 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass, 1.0 to 2.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 50 to 85 percent phosphate retention, 3 to 12 percent air-dry 15-bar water content and 4 to 13 percent moist 15-bar water content.  The weighted average of 8xSi+2xFe is 5 to 8. The solum averages less than 35 percent pumice, cinder, and andesite fragments and has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 5 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam and contains 0 to 15 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 8 percent cinder gravel, 0 to 15 percent andesite gravel, and 0 to 3 percent andesite cobbles.\nSome pedons lack an A horizon and have an albic horizon (E) up to 3 inches thick when this occurs slopes are typically less than 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand, ashy sandy loam, or ashy sand and contains 0 to 15 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 5 percent cinder gravel, 0 to 20 percent andesite gravel, and 0 to 3 percent andesite cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 6 moist, 2 through 6 dry.  It is ashy sand, ashy coarse sand, or ashy loamy sand.  The upper part contains 0 to 15 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 20 percent cinder gravel, 0 to 15 percent andesite gravel, and 0 to 2 percent andesite or cinder cobbles.  The lower part may contain greater than 35 percent pumice paragravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belrick, Hutson, Millerpoint, Spexarth and Winegar series.  Belrick soils are on glacial moraines with skeletal glacial till at 20 to 40 inches, and have an umbric epipedon.  Hutson soils have fine-earth textures of loam, or fine sandy loam with acid oxalate aluminum and half iron of over 2 percent.  Millerpoint soils have acid oxalate aluminum and half iron of 2 to 5 percent and have fine-earth textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Spexarth soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Winegar soils are moderately deep to densic materials."

The soils formed primarily in volcanic ash from Mt. Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

If this property is not present, depending on slope, runoff may be low.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
