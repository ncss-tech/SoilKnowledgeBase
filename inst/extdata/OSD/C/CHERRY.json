    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 5 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section typically averages between 27 and 35 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some is loam, clay or clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk or BCk horizon.  They are not calcic horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam, and is stratified in many pedons.  Coarser or finer textures are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Slope gradients typically are between 2 and 10 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in local alluvium from silty shales.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches."

Shambo, Farland and Savage soils are on nearby terraces in valleys.  These soils have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Farland and Savage soils have an argillic horizon; Savage soils are fine; and Shambo soils are fine-loamy.  Arnegard, Grail and Grassna soils are on nearly level concave swales and fans in nearby uplands and terraces and have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Cabba and Wayden soils are on crests of hills and steep slopes on nearby uplands.  They have paralithic contacts at depths of less than 20 inches.  Lohler soils are on nearby stream flood plains.  They do not have cambic horizons and are fine.  Morton and Sen soils are on uplands and have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Morton soils have argillic horizons."
