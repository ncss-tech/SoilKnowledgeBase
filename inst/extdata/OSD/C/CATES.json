  "OVERVIEW": "The Cates series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from siltstone. Cates soils are on hills and knobs. Slope ranges from 25 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
