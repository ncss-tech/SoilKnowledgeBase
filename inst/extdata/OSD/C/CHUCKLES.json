They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,098 to 1,310 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
