  "OVERVIEW": "The Chuckles series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. Chuckles soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and lagoons. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
