These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,485 to 2,075 meters.  The climate is moist subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 560 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 50 to 100 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 84 cm (A1, A2, A3, and A4 horizons).\nEndosaturation features - The zone from 30 to 178 cm (A3, C1, C2 and C3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (A3, A4, and part of the A2 and C1 horizons).\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".  Field study is needed to determine if \"Cumulic\" or \"Cumulic Vertic\" is the correct subgroup.  The wide precipitation range of 200 to 560 mm and various phases with a wide range of water table depths indicates that this series needs to be refined in an MLRA update.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
