  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sand is 80 or more inches.  Lamellae are present at depths of 40 to 80 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout. Content of silt plus clay is less than 5 percent and very fine sand is less than 20 percent at depths between 10 and 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe AE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.    Mottles and streaks with chroma of 2 or less are the color of uncoated sand grains and are not indicative of wetness.  They range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E part of the E&Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bt part of the E&Bt horizon consists of lamellae with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The individual lamellae range from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.  The total thickness of the lamellae within a depth of 80 inches or more is normally 5 to 12 millimeters, but ranges from 1 to 55 millimeters. Texture ranges from fine sand to sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, is below 80 inches.  It has the same range of color as the lamellae part of the E&Bt horizon.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Series in similar families are the Archbold, Astatula, Lake, Neilhurst, Palm Beach, St. Lucie, and Tavares soils.  None of the competing soils have lamellae.  In addition, Archbold and Tavares soils are moderately well drained, and Lake soils have 5 to 10 percent clay within the 10- to 40-inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Candler soils are on uplands in peninsular Florida.  Slopes primarily range from 0 to 12 percent, but up to 40 percent in dissected areas. They formed in thick beds of eolian or  sandy marine deposits.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Adamsville soils are on lower positions.  The well drained Apopka and Arredondo soils are on similar to lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick to an argillic horizon.  The well drained Gainesville soils are on similar to slightly lower positions, do not have lamellae, and have 10 to 15 percent clay within the 10 to 40-inch control section.  The moderately well drained Millhopper soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.  The well drained Orlando soils are on similar positions but have uniform texture of sand or fine sand with 1 to 12 percent fines that extends to depths of 80 inches or more. Paola soils are on lower positions and have a poorly defined spodic horizon.  The very poorly drained Pompano soils are on lower positions."

The concept of Candler soils limits the series to sandy soils that have lamellae.  Total thickness of lamellae is l to 6 inches between depths of 40 and 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data is provided by the University of Florida, Department of Soil and Water Science, Gainesville, FL.  http://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/flsoils/index.asp\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
