  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavalry series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium modified by eolian sands.  These gently sloping soils are on alluvial flats on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
