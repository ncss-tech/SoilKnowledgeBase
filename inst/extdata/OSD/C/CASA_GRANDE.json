These soils formed in old alluvium from a wide variety of rocks including granite, rhyolite, andesite, quartzite and possibly some limestone and basalt. Annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (150 to 250 mm); and the mean annual air temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F. (19.4 to 23.9 degrees C.) The frost-free period ranges from 240 to 350 days."
