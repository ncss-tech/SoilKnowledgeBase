  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic or lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 57 degrees F.  The soil between a depth of about 6 to 27 inches is usually moist but is dry in all parts for about 120 to 150 days from sometime in June until sometime in November.  Rock fragments range from about 5 to 35 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, 5/2, 4/2, 3/2; 5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, 5/3, 4/3, 3/3, 5/2, 4/2 or 3/2.  It is sandy loam or loam and is gravelly, cobbly, or stony in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.  The lower boundary is gradual or there is an underlying AB horizon or BA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR or 5YR 7/8, 6/8, 7/6, 6/6, 4/4, 5/6 and 5YR 5/8, 4/8, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4, 5/3 or 4/3.  It is clay loam or loam and is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons.  It is 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 16 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.  Base saturation is 35 to 50 percent."

All of these soils, with the exception of Cle Elum, Hotaw, Speaker, Tigit, and Wohly, are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Cle Elum, Speaker, Tigit and Wohly soils are dry for less than 120 days in most years.  Hotaw soils have 16 to 26 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crozier soils are on plateaus. They formed in material weathered from lahar or extrusive volcanic rocks at elevations of 2,000 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The climate is moist, subhumid with dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Annual precipitation is 30 to 70 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F; average January temperature is 39 degrees F and average July temperature is 70 degrees F."
