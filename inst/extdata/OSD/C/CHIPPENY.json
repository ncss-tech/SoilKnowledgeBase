  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to limestone bedrock commonly is 51 to 102 centimeters but ranges from 51 to 130 centimeters. Woody fragments ranging in size from 2 to 15 centimeters in diameter are at random throughout the control section and comprise 10 to 15 percent of the volume in some pedons. The organic portion of the control section commonly has pH of 6.5 to 7.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride, but ranges from pH of 6.1 to 7.8.\nThe broken face of the surface tier has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2 or is neutral. This tier consists of sapric and/or hemic material with primarily woody fibers but in some pedons individual layers within the tier are primarily herbaceous fibers. It has a weak to moderate granular structure. In some pedons the structure is coarse blocky, breaking to granular. The subsurface and bottom tiers have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Pressed colors generally increase one or two units in chroma. These tiers are dominantly sapric material. Some pedons have thin layers of hemic material with higher chroma. Materials commonly are massive; however, some pedons have a granular, blocky or platy structure. The ash content in the organic part of the control section immediately above the 2C layer or lithic contact ranges up to about 60 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 50 percent. It is dominantly silty clay loam, loam, or sandy loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam to clay with some pedons having gravel or cobbles or both. Some pedons have a Cr horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very channery silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Trout Bay (T) series. Trout Bay soils have pH in the organic horizons ranging from very strongly acid to moderately acid and are on steeper slopes overlying sandstone bedrock. Closely related or similar are the Carbondale, Cathro, Dawson, Greenwood, Markey, and Tawas series. All these soils do not have a lithic contact within the control section. Carbondale and Greenwood soils have organic materials extending to depths greater than 130 centimeters. Cathro soils have a layer of loamy textures more than 30 centimeters thick in the subsurface or bottom tiers. Dawson, Markey, and Tawas soils have a layer of sandy textures more than 30 centimeters thick in the subsurface or bottom tiers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chippeny soils are in depressions and drainage ways on ground moraines, outwash plains and lake plains. Slope gradients are generally less than 2 percent, but range to 12 percent on some seepy bedrock bench positions. Annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 840 millimeters; the mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C; and mean summer temperature ranges from 16 to 18 degrees C."

The very poorly drained Carbondale, Cathro, and Lupton soils are very deep to bedrock and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained Nahma and Ruse soils are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Ensign and Sundell soils and the well drained Longrie and Summerville soils are on adjacent upland plains."

Representative wet soil moisture status is at the surface during the months October to June. Representative ponding depth is from 7 to 15 centimeters during the months of October to June. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the organic material is moderately high to high and it is moderately high or high in the Cg horizon."
