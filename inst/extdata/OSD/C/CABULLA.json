  "REVDATE": "03/2011",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabulla series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Cabulla soils are on escarpments, ledges, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
