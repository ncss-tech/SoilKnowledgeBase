  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabba series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated, loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on hills, escarpments, and sedimentary plains. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
