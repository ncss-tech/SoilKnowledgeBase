  "REVDATE": "04/2007",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clanton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 15 to 40 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying residuum from reddish, acid, Pennsylvania shale.  These soils are on the lower part of convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that border major streams.  Slope ranges from 9 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.",
