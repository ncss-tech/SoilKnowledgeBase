  "OVERVIEW": "The Coldfeet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Coldfeet soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.",
