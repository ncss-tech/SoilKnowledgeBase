  "OVERVIEW": "The Chasmfalls series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks, schist and gneiss.  Chasmfalls soils are on mountain slopes and pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
