  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cottoneva soils occur on recent flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 0 to 170 meters.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1780 millimeters.  Mean January temperature is about10 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."

Irmulco and Tramway soils are fine-loamy, Dehaven and Hotel soils are loamy-skeletal and Vandamme soils are clayey.  Eelriver soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser particles and have redoxiorphic features between 25 and 50 centimeters."
