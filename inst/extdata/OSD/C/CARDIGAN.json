  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm. Solum thickness ranges from 41 to 91 cm.  Rock fragments of gravel, channers, flagstones, and cobbles range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and 10 to 50 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.  Clay content ranges from 4 to 18 percent and the weighted average silt content in the solum is greater than 40 percent.\nThe O horizon ranges from slightly decomposed to highly decomposed plant material. It 1s 0 to 3 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A or Ap horizon is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak granular or platy structure, or it is massive.  Consistence ranges from very friable to firm.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have thin layers of soft bedrock overlying the hard bedrock."

Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Edneyville, Gallimore, Rixeyville, Soco, and Stecoah soils are from outside LRR R. Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut Rixeyville, and Stecoah soils are underlain by saprolite and/or a paralithic contact. Hazel, Lordstown and Steinsburg soils have rock fragments dominated by hard sedimentary rocks. Charlton, Delaware, Dutchess, Riverhead, and St. Albans soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock. Greenbelt soils formed in anthropogenic material on modified landscapes in and near major urbanized areas. Newport soils are underlain by dense till. Yalesville soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B and C horizons."

The soils formed in till or colluvium derived from local phyllite, slate, shale, and schist.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1270 mm and the frost-free period is 110 to 180 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location narrative was changed to match the narrative in the Sullivan County soil survey.  Cardigan soils were previously included with the Hollis series in mapping.  The description was updated to metric units in 2012; the typical pedon depths were originally described using English units.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 cm (Oe and A horizons).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 58 cm (Bw horizon).\nc.  Lithic contact - phyllite bedrock at 78 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
