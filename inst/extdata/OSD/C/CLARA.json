Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is less than 7 inches in thickness.  It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less (rubbed).  Texture is sand, fine sand, mucky sand, or mucky fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3, or value of 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features and vertical streaks in shades of brown or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Where chroma is less than 6 in the upper part of the Bw horizon, the color is more than 1 unit of value darker than the overlying E horizon.  Small splotches, streaks or discontinuous lenses of organically stained material with value less than 4 are in the upper part of the Bw horizon in some pedons.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow or gray range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

Goldhead, Pelham, and Tooles soils have a loamy argillic horizon at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Meadowbrook, Plummer, and Starke soils have a loamy argillic horizon at depths of 40 to 79 inches.  Leon and Pottsburg soils have a spodic horizon.  Osier and Rutlege soils do not have a stained subsoil layer.  In addition, Rutlege soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland or wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation in depressional areas consists of water tolerant grasses, sedges, and shrubs, such as maidencane, sand cordgrass, chalky bluestem, St.Johnswort, primrose willow, pickerel weed, and pennywort.  Some depressional areas have a hardwood overstory consisting mainly of red maple, bay, water oak, cabbage palm, cypress and pond pine.  On flood plains and hammocks, the vegetation consists of dense overstories of water oak, laurel oak, red maple, cypress, sweetgum, blackgum, slash and loblolly pine, and bay; a sparse understory vegetation consists mainly of cabbage palm, longleaf uniola, maidencane, blackberry, greenbriar and brackenfern.  Slough areas are dominated by water tolerant sedges, grasses and shrubs, such as maidencane, bluestems, sand cordgrass, and cabbage palms."
