  "OVERVIEW": "The Clara series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils in flats, sloughs, flood plains, and depressions on the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

Small splotches, streaks or discontinuous lenses of organically stained material with value less than 4 are in the upper part of the Bw horizon in some pedons.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow or gray range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3.

The natural vegetation in depressional areas consists of water tolerant grasses, sedges, and shrubs, such as maidencane, sand cordgrass, chalky bluestem, St.Johnswort, primrose willow, pickerel weed, and pennywort.  Some depressional areas have a hardwood overstory consisting mainly of red maple, bay, water oak, cabbage palm, cypress and pond pine.  On flood plains and hammocks, the vegetation consists of dense overstories of water oak, laurel oak, red maple, cypress, sweetgum, blackgum, slash and loblolly pine, and bay; a sparse understory vegetation consists mainly of cabbage palm, longleaf uniola, maidencane, blackberry, greenbriar and brackenfern.  Slough areas are dominated by water tolerant sedges, grasses and shrubs, such as maidencane, bluestems, sand cordgrass, and cabbage palms."
