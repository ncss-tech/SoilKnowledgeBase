Budlamp and Yarbam soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the control section. and in addition Yarbam soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 40 percent. Siphoncan soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite and are noncalcareous."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic tuff, dacitic breccia and tuffaceous dacite lava.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
