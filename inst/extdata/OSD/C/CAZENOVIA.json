Rock fragments range from 2 to 25 percent by volume in the solum and from 10 to 40 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel and cobbles but also include some stones and channery fragments.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral. The E horizon and part of the B/E horizon are incorporated in the Ap horizon by deep plowing in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam through silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B/E horizon has colors similar to the Bt and E horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 28 to 35 percent clay. Some pedons have subhorizons that are silty clay. It has moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky or subangular blocky or very coarse prismatic structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic accumulations may be present. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and pH increases with depth. Some pedons have carbonates in the lower part of the B horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have subhorizons that are silty clay. It has moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky or subangular blocky or very coarse prismatic structure. Consistence is firm or very firm. Redoximorphic accumulations may be present. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. It is firm or very firm consistence. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, Summitville, and Vaughnsville series in the same family. Adamstown, Beech, Funkstown, Mt. Zion, Richland, and Summitville soils formed in colluvium of residual origin or residuum. Blakeslee have carbonates at a depth greater than 80 inches. El Dara soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments by volume in the particle size control section. Hilton, Kidami, and Lima soils have particle-size control sections that average between 18 and 27 percent clay. Miami soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Pevely soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Rainsville soils are more than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Rawson soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the control section. Shawtown soils formed in more than 40 inches of outwash materials and do not have dense till. Vaughnsville soils allow less than 27 percent clay content in the particle-size control sections.\nThe Aurora, Conesus, Danley, Honeoye, Lansing, Ontario, Nunda, Wampsville, and Wassaic are series in similar families. Aurora and Wassaic soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Conesus, Danley and Nunda soils have 2 chroma redox depletions in the argillic horizon. Honeoye, Lansing, and Ontario soils have particle-size control sections that average between 18 and 27 percent clay. Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new pedon from Genesee County was used because the typical pedon does not match the typical pedon for Cazenovia in the Ontario and Yates County, NY Soil Survey.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Albic horizon - the zone from 10 to 12 inches (E horizon).\n3. Argillic horizon - the zone from 19 to 31 inches below the soil surface (B/E and Bt horizons).\n4. Glossic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of albic material in the upper part of the argillic horizon (B/E).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
