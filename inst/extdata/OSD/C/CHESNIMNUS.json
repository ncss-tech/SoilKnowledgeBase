The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the very gravelly substratum is 35 to 50 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 10 to 23 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The texture is silt loam or loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, with 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bk1 and Bk2 horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, with 0 to 25 percent gravel.  They have 0 to 5 percent CaCO3.\nThe Bk3 horizon, when present, has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The texture is loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It has 10 to 15 percent CaCO3.\nThe 2Bk4 horizon has color similar to the Bk3 horizon.
