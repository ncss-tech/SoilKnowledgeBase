  "OVERVIEW": "The Chesnimnus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  Chesnimnus soils are on outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
