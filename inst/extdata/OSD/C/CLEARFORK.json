It was changed from a fine to fine silty particle size class  based on NSSL and TAMU laboratory data.\nEdited 10/2015 (RFG-ROG): Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 39 in). (A2, A3, Bw1 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 72 cm (0 to 28 in). (A1, A2, A3 horizons)\nCambic horizon: 72 to 209 cm (28 to 82 in). (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 horizons)\nCumulic feature: mollic epipedon about 71 cm (28 in) thick and have irregular decrease in organic matter\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Sample Nos. 84P 203-208 of pedon S83TX429001(1-6) from the type location.
