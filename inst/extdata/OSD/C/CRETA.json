This is a mid and tall grass site with a good variety of forbs and a smaller woody plant component. Major grass species are little and sand bluestem, sideoats, hairy, and blue grama, and indiangrass. Forbs include daleas, dotted gayfeather, sensitive brier, ratany,\nprairieclover, gauras, and bushsunflower. Sand sagebrush is the major woody species along with small amounts of yucca, shin oak, sumacs and skunkbush.
