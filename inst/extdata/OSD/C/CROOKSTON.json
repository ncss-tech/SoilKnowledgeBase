The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons over the Ck horizon ranges from 20 to 28 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to less than 2.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  It contains 2.4 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam to silt loam, marginal to fine sandy loam with more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It has common faint clay films occurring mainly in pores and as bridges between sand grains.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam to fine sandy loam.  The Ck horizon has lime content of 25 to 35 percent."
