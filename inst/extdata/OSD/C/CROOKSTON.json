The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons over the Ck horizon ranges from 20 to 28 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to less than 2.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  It contains 2.4 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam to silt loam, marginal to fine sandy loam with more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It has common faint clay films occurring mainly in pores and as bridges between sand grains.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam to fine sandy loam.  The Ck horizon has lime content of 25 to 35 percent."

Also, Newell soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons and Squaw soils lack horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Roystone soils lack calcic horizons.  Medon soils have clay loam argillic horizons with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Timpanogos soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick, with chroma of 2 or more, and have argillic horizons."

Gradients are dominantly 0 to 3 percent and range to 8 percent.  Parent materials are light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone of the Salt Lake formation.  The climate is moist subhumid with an average annual precipitation of about 15 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
