They are fine sand or sand in the A and E horizons and sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand in the Bh horizons.  Depth to the Bh horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of  1 or 2.  Total thickness of the A and E horizons is 30 to 50 inches.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  This horizon is noncemented and the sand grains are well coated with organic matter.  Total thickness of the Bh horizon is more than 30 inches. The horizon is massive or has blocky or subangular blocky structure."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Similar series in other families are the Immokalee, Kureb, Leon, Lynn Haven, Myakka, Ona, Paola, Pomello, Ridgeland, and Rimini series. Immokalee, Leon, Lynn Haven, Myakka, Ona, and Ridgeland soils are saturated with water during the wet seasons.  Kureb and Paola soils lack a spodic horizon.  Immokalee, Myakka, Ona, Paola, and Pomello soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Pomello soils have a water table at depths of 24 to 40 inches during wet seasons.  Ona and Ridgeland soils lack E horizons between the A and Bh horizons.  Rimini soils have Bh horizons within depths of 50 to 80 inches."
