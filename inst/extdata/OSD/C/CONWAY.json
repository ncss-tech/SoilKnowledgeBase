  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - The soil between a depth of 25 and 84 cm is usually dry between about August 15 and November 15 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5.0 degrees C. from about April 15 to November 30, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from about May 15 to October 30.  A high water table is present at a depth of 0 to 122 cm but is typically above 30 cm at some time of the year during the growing season.\nMean annual soil temperature - 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C.  High water table levels contribute to a lower mean annual soil temperature than geographically associated soils.\nMollic epipedon thickness - 60 to 100 cm.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 15 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are granite and volcanic rocks such as rhyolite; Volcanic glass content: Estimated at 5 to 15 percent glass in coarse silt through very coarse sand fractions with oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron contents of less than 0.2 percent.\nA horizons\nDry color:  10YR 3/3, 4/2, or 5/2.\nMoist color:  10YR 2/2 or 3/2.\nTexture:  Sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly sandy loam, or cobbly sandy loam.\nRock fragments:  0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles.\nReaction:  Slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the A1 horizon, neutral to moderately alkaline in the A2 and A3 horizons.\nOrganic matter content:  2 to 4 percent.\nRedoximorphic features:  Few or common, distinct or prominent masses of iron accumulation.\nC and Cg horizons\nDry color: 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 7/1; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 7/1, or 8/1.  Moist color: 10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 4/2 or 5GY 5/1.\nTexture: Gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, or cobbly coarse sandy loam; strata of loamy sand to very cobbly loamy sand are common.\nRock fragments: 10 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\nRedoximorphic features: Common or many masses of iron accumulation; redox depletion of iron is evident as the low chroma matrix in gleyed subhorizons.\nOther features: Cobbly substratum phases are recognized with 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, 15 to 25 percent of which are cobbles.  Texture of very cobbly coarse sandy loam occurs in such phases at depths below 40 inches."

Sanpoil soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are not dry between August 15 and November 15.  Schrader soils average 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and do not have volcanic glass in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Conway soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and they are associated with springs, seeps, and riparian water courses.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic and mixed sources influenced by volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 8,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 16 inches, much of it as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 150 days."
