  "OVERVIEW": "The Chill series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from granitic rock. Chill soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
