  "OVERVIEW": "The Catamount series consists of shallow, excessively or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Catamount soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

(all mineral horizons)\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 23 inches.\nThe contact with weathered granite (grus) may be more accurately described as a densic contact; clods of this material were described during sampling as very fragile hence are probably not cemented."

Surface type indicated is a loam, but clay and coarse fragments are minimal in the sampled pedon.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
