(all mineral horizons)\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 23 inches.\nThe contact with weathered granite (grus) may be more accurately described as a densic contact; clods of this material were described during sampling as very fragile hence are probably not cemented.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil sampled in 1981 in El Paso County as lab sample number S82CO-041-001 and in Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest as lab sample number S91CO-069-005. Surface type indicated is a loam, but clay and coarse fragments are minimal in the sampled pedon.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
