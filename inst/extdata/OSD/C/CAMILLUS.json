(7 to 11 inches thick.)\nBw -- 10 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure breaking to weak fine and medium granular structure; friable, slightly sticky; many fine roots; many medium and large pores; 1 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (1 to 19 inches thick.)\nBC -- 16 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) in the upper part grading to grayish brown (10YR 5/2) in the lower part (inherited from parent material), silt loam; very weak very coarse platy structure breaking to fine and medium angular and subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky; many fine roots; many medium and large pores; few partially weathered fine shale fragments; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 18 through 30 inches. Depth to soft shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Fine, partially weathered shale fragments are common in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon. Hard rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. The fine-earth fraction contains between 15 through 25 percent coarser than very fine sand, and also has 18 through 24 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is dominantly silt loam, but is loam or very fine sandy loam in some pedons. Structure ranges from weak coarse blocky through moderate fine granular.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y. In some pedons, redoximorphic concentrations occur below depths of 16 inches. Structure is dominantly moderate, medium or coarse, subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon, with properties similar to those of the Bw and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon contains soft calcareous shale in various stages of weathering and extends to depths of up to 8 feet, and has colors similar to those of the C horizon. Below that depth the bedrock grades into hard unweathered shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Gardenisle and Hennepin series were in the same family. Gardenisle soils have more than 20 percent rock fragment content in the substratum and are underlain by argillite and limestone bedrock. Hennepin soils do not have a paralithic or lithic contact within 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Camillus soils are commonly on short gently undulating slopes of 2 through 8 percent on till plains, but some are on slopes as much as 25 percent. The soil formed mainly in material weathered from the underlying shale and in part in till. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 40 inches, mean annual temperature from 46 degrees through 50 degrees F. The mean annual frost-free period ranges from 140 through 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Common associates are Honeoye, Ontario, and Lairdsville soils, all of which have argillic horizons. Also, the Palatine soils that have more than 35 percent coarse fragments and the shallow to bedrock Benson soils."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is typically very low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral soil. A perched water table may be present for less than one month."
