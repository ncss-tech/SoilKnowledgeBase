Thickness of the upper outwash sediments ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap  horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam but includes loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Rock fragments make up 1 to 10 percent, by volume, mostly of gravel size.  The reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have an E horizon as much as 6 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Included are subhorizons that are sandy clay loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loam, or their gravelly analogues.  The Bt horizon averages between 8 to 18 percent clay and 55 to 75 sand.  Rock fragments make up 5 to 35 percent, by volume, mostly gravel in size.  The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragments make up 10 to 35 percent, by volume, mostly gravel in size.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Langola, Linveldt, Nereson, and Oylen series.  Langola soils have dense till in the lower third of the series control section with a bulk density exceeding 1.80 g/cc.  Linveldt soils are underlain by glacial till that averages more than 18 percent clay.  Nereson soils do not have sandy textures in the series control section.  Oylen soils do not have loamy textures in the lower third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in 40 to 60 inches of outwash sediments and underlying loamy glacial till.  These materials are of Late Wisconsinan age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.   Frost-free days range from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation is 1200 to 1550 feet above sea level."

Brandsvold soils are poorly drained and are in deeper concave positions.  Dorset and Verndale soils are well drained and are not underlain by glacial till on similar positions in the landscape.  Kandota and Knute soils formed entirely in glacial till.  Nitche soils are higher lying and are well drained.  Oylen soils have similar positions but do not have loamy glacial till underlying material."
