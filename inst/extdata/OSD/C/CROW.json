  "OVERVIEW": "The Crow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till from Tertiary age sediment.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, mountains, hills, and glacial moraines. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
