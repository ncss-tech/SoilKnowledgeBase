Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the A and Bt horizons and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the Btg or 2Btg and 2Cg horizons.  Content of plinthite ranges from none to 4 percent and content of ironstone nodules ranges from 0 to 10 percent, by volume, in the subsoil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Content of quartz pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent, by volume.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  It is 6 to 15 inches thick where it occurs.  Some pedons have a thin BA horizon with similar colors as the E horizon.  Textures of the BA horizon are sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and gray.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Angie, Chrysler, Mena, and Subran soils in the same family.  These soils are all moderately well drained.  In addition, Chrysler soils are on stream terraces.  Mena soils are forming in old alluvium and pedisediments and are underlain by sandstone and shale.  Subran soils occur on transitional landscapes of the Coastal Plain and Blackland Prairie."

The climate is humid semitropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches."

Atmore, Escambia and Poarch soils have coarse-loamy control sections and have subsoil horizons with 5 percent or more plinthite.  In addition, the poorly drained Atmore soils are on lower positions.  Escambia soils are on similar to slightly lower positions.  The moderately well drained Poarch soils are on higher positions.  The somewhat poorly to poorly drained Pinebarren and Tibbie soils are on lower positions.  They have a coarse-loamy and fine-loamy particle-size control section, respectively."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 4 to 85 inches (Bt, Btg and 2Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons).\nCowpen soils occur on landforms that were formerly mapped as Susquehanna in older soil surveys.  Cowpen soils differ from Susquehanna in having mixed rather than smectitic mineralogy.  In addition, Cowpen soils have a base saturation lower than 35 percent (by sum of cations) at a depth of 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.\nCowpen soils are saturated within a depth of 1.0 to 3.0 feet of the surface for short periods during the winter and spring.\nCowpen soils are in MLRA 133A.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization Sample S07AL-129-003 (1-6).  Sample analyzed by NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
