  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowpen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on ridges, knolls, and side slopes on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in clayey Miocene-age sediments.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 58 inches. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.",

In addition, Chrysler soils are on stream terraces.  Mena soils are forming in old alluvium and pedisediments and are underlain by sandstone and shale.  Subran soils occur on transitional landscapes of the Coastal Plain and Blackland Prairie."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 4 to 85 inches (Bt, Btg and 2Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons).\nCowpen soils occur on landforms that were formerly mapped as Susquehanna in older soil surveys.  Cowpen soils differ from Susquehanna in having mixed rather than smectitic mineralogy.  In addition, Cowpen soils have a base saturation lower than 35 percent (by sum of cations) at a depth of 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.\nCowpen soils are saturated within a depth of 1.0 to 3.0 feet of the surface for short periods during the winter and spring.\nCowpen soils are in MLRA 133A."
