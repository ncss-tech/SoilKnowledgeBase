  "OVERVIEW": "The Chicken series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slide deposits derived from mixed igneous and interbedded sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on hills, mountain slopes, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
