  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Ducor series surveyed in previous soil surveys is now recognized as Centerville series. This soil originally was described as having a paralithic contact. In re-examining the type location, it was found that no paralithic contact existed. It is likely that there is a paralithic contact in this soil where mapped in Tulare Central Part Soil Survey on slopes greater than 15 percent (hill landforms) with granitic parent material. This will need to be re-evaluated in Tulare Central Part Soil Survey at a later date.\nSeries reclassified on July, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
