  "OVERVIEW": "The Centerville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, mainly from granitic sources.  Centerville soils are on alluvial fans and dissected stream terraces, and slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Ducor series surveyed in previous soil surveys is now recognized as Centerville series. This soil originally was described as having a paralithic contact. In re-examining the type location, it was found that no paralithic contact existed. It is likely that there is a paralithic contact in this soil where mapped in Tulare Central Part Soil Survey on slopes greater than 15 percent (hill landforms) with granitic parent material. This will need to be re-evaluated in Tulare Central Part Soil Survey at a later date.\nSeries reclassified on July, 1998."
