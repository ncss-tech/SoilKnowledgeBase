  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Castalia series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in beach or eolian deposits mixed with glacially displaced limestone or dolostone fragments of local origin. These soils are on reefs on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Castalia soils are on reefs on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. The soils formed in beach or eolian deposits mixed with glacially displaced limestone or dolostone fragments of Silurian or Devonian age. Glacial ice fractured the solid limestone or dolostone and transported the fragments short distances. Subsequent wave erosion from Glacial Lake Maumee removed the thin till cap leaving behind glacial erratics and locally displaced limestone or dolostone on the surface. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 238 meters (600 and 780 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dunbridge, Marblehead, Milton, and Millsdale soils. Dunbridge soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent rock fragments. They are on positions on reefs where loamy sediments have accumulated. The Marblehead soils formed in 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) of loamy glacial drift over limestone or dolostone and are on summits or north-facing slopes of relict reefs. Milton soils have an argillic horizon formed in till. They are on positions on the relict reefs that have till deposits. Millsdale soils are very poorly drained and have an argillic horizon formed in till. They are on level areas adjacent to reefs."
