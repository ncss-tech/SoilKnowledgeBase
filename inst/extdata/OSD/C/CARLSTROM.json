  "OVERVIEW": "The Carlstrom series consists of soils formed in moderately thin noncalcareous moderately fine to fine tetured materials weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Carlstrom soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Typically, Carlstrom soils have brown very friable granular noncalcareous A1 horizons and pale brown noncalcareous clay C horizons over shale bedrock at a depth of 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout except that very thin, discontinuous, weakly calcareous subhorizons occur immediately above the shale in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam or light clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR but subhorizons redder than 75YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
