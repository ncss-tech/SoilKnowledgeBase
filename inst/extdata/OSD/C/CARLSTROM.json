  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout except that very thin, discontinuous, weakly calcareous subhorizons occur immediately above the shale in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam or light clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR but subhorizons redder than 75YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carlstrom soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes typically range from 2 to about 60 percent.  The soil formed in moderately thin noncalcareous moderately fine to fine textured materials weathered from sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
