  "OVERVIEW": "The Carlshend series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy till over sandstone bedrock.  These soils are on sandstone benches.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the weathered bedrock.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
