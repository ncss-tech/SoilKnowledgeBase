  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 5 to 20 inches.  Solution holes up to 50 inches deep and spaced at intervals of 1 to 3 meters may be present.  Cobbles or stones, up to 15 percent, by volume, are present in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the A and Bw horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nA thin layer, commonly 2 inches thick and composed of soft limestone mixed with fine sand, is present in some pedons.\nThe R horizon is composed of limestone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Citronelle soils are on slightly elevated limestone ridges on young marine terraces and on the better drained crests of flats of the Gulf coastal lowlands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in sandy marine deposits over limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 52 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 71 to 73 degrees F."

In addition, Adamsville soils very deep and are uncoated in the control section.  Broward soils are moderately deep to limestone and are uncoated.  Redlevel soils are deep to limestone and are coated.  The very poorly or poorly drained Boca and Hallandale soils are on adjacent lower flats and depressions.  In addition, Boca soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness, are moderately deep to limestone, and have argillic horizons."

The vegetation consists of cabbage palm and scattered slash pine and the understory is composed of pineland threeawn, fetterbush, grassleaf goldaster, chalky bluestem, creeping bluestem, panicum, lopsided indiangrass, switchgrass, and saw palmetto."
