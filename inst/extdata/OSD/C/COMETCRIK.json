  "OVERVIEW": "The Cometcrik series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
