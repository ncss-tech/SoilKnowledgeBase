Horizons having mollic colors lack the thickness for a mollic epipedon.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6. It is cobbly loam and gravelly loam. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent with O to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, or very cobbly loamy coarse sand. Rock fragments range from 50 to 70 percent, 5 to 25 percent cobbles and 35 to 65 percent pebble. The C horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous and moderately or strongly alkaline."
