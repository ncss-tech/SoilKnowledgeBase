The moderately well drained Ava soils have a fragipan horizon and are on adjacent or nearby similar or steeper slopes in the uplands. Banlic soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on adjacent or nearby low terraces or elevated positions on flood plains typically at lower elevations than Creal soils. Belknap soils are on flood plains below Creal soils. Bluford soils contain more clay in the control section and are on broad upland ridges and knolls typically above Creal soils. The well drained Parke soils contain more sand in the lower part of the solum and typically are above Creal soils on loess-mantled ridges nearby. The poorly drained Racoon soils are on low terraces or elevated positions on the flood plains below Creal soils."
