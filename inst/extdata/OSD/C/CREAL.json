Belknap soils are on flood plains below Creal soils. Bluford soils contain more clay in the control section and are on broad upland ridges and knolls typically above Creal soils. The well drained Parke soils contain more sand in the lower part of the solum and typically are above Creal soils on loess-mantled ridges nearby. The poorly drained Racoon soils are on low terraces or elevated positions on the flood plains below Creal soils."
