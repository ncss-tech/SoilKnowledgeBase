    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coal Palace soils are on slopes of hills and valleys constructed after strip mining operations. Reclamation operations resulted in landforms similar to pre-mining contours. Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. The soils were excavated and replaced with loamy and clayey material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 875 to 1000 mm (34 to 39 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 230 days. Elevation is 100 to 305 meters above mean sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThese soils are the result of pre-1994 strip mining. The landscape was returned to its original elevation and contour, and topsoil was created by incorporating organic matter into the reshaped mine spoil. The subsurface is formed in replaced soil and pararock fragments from loess, till, shale and sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. The substratum is a mixture of shale and sandstone overburden moved during mining. Any redox features present in the profile are not indicators of modern drainage conditions.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 25 to 40 cm.\nSeries control section: the zone from 0 to a depth of 65 cm.\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 12 cm.\nDensic contact: at a depth of 40 cm.\nThe name is from the Coal Palace Exhibition center that stood in Ottumwa, Iowa from 1890 until 1892.\nTaxonomy version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, thirteenth edition, 2022."
