    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise stated depth ranges in the paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface. The thickness of the eolian mantle ranges from 16 to 24 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 24 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 70 inches.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A, E, and B horizons and from 5 to 35 percent in the 2B and 2C horizons.  Cobble and stone content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A, E, and B horizons and from 0 to 15 percent in the 2B and 2C horizons.  Stone cover ranges from less than 0.01 percent to 0.3 percent of the surface.\nThe 0 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 and and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2.\nThe A and E horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or cobbly analogues of these textures.  The A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma  of 3 or 4. A Bs3 horizon is in some pedons.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  The B horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nSome pedons have a 2Ex and/or a 2(B/E)x horizon. The 2Ex horizon and and E part of the 2(B/E)x horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2.\nThe 2Bx horizon and B part of the the 2(B/E)x horizons horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The 2Ex, 2(B/E)x and 2Bx horizons are gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly loamy fine sand.   The lower 2B does not have enough clay to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly loamy fine sand with pockets and lenses of gravelly sand in some pedons.  The material contains abundant dark slates and schists.  The 2C horizon averages less than 12 percent clay."

Trimountain soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the substratum, and formed in till containing basalt and andesite amygdaloids and conglomerates. Worth soils are underlain by dense slowly permeable till (Cd horizons) within 40 to 65 inches. The Kallio soil has an argillic horizon and from 12 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  The Net soil has mottles in the upper part of the B horizon and has a stony surface."
