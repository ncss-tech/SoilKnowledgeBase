  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chilimol series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium derived from igneous rock. Chilimol soils occur on piedmont slopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hathaway (AZ), Pinery (TX) and the Tascosa (TX) series. Hathaway soils average less than 20 percent clay content in the particle-size control section. Pinery soils formed in gravelly alluvial sediments from limestone sources, are slightly more moist in the soil moisture control section, and support pinyon, juniper, and oak. Tascosa soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and are typical of the Ogallala Formation in the Southern High Plains."
