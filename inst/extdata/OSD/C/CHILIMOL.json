  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hathaway (AZ), Pinery (TX) and the Tascosa (TX) series. Hathaway soils average less than 20 percent clay content in the particle-size control section. Pinery soils formed in gravelly alluvial sediments from limestone sources, are slightly more moist in the soil moisture control section, and support pinyon, juniper, and oak. Tascosa soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and are typical of the Ogallala Formation in the Southern High Plains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chilimol soils occur on piedmont slopes and fan remnants at elevations of 4,500 to 6,695 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium derived from igneous rock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."
