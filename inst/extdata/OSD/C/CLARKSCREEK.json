  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarkscreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on glaciated mountain slopes.  Clarkscreek soils formed in till from mixed rocks, mixed with volcanic ash and loess in surface horizons. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature about 36 degrees F.",
