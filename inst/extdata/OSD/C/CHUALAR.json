  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F., and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures is less than 19 degrees F.  The soil from about 6 to 20 inches usually is dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Coarse and very coarse angular sand particles make up 20 to 30 percent of the A and C horizons and 20 to 25 percent of the  Bt horizon.  Rock fragments, mostly fine angular gravel, range from 1 to 2 percent to about 25 percent, but most pedons have less than 15 percent gravel.  Also there are numerous mica particles throughout the profile.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2, 4/4, 4/2 or 3/2.  Moist colors have values or chromas of 3 or less.  It is sandy loam or loam and it is slightly acid or neutral.  In some pedons, the A horizon is slightly alkaline because of soil amendments, irrigation water or other cultural measures.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure and is slightly hard or hard. Organic matter content is 1 to 4 percent to a depth of more than 10 inches and decrease regularly and is less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  The lower boundary is diffuse or there is a transitional AB or BA horizon. Note: reaction of the A horizon and possibly of the BA horizon is alkaline because of fertilizers or amendments.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/2, 5/4; 10YR 4/2, 5/3, 5/4.  It is heavy sandy loam or sandy clay loam and average 18 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon is massive or has weak to moderate angular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and is moderately alkaline in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6.  It is somewhat stratified loamy sand, sandy loam, or light sandy clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ballard, Bohna, Chuloak (T), Franciscan, Gilroy, Pinto, Sagaser, Shimmon, Soper and Tehachapi series.   Ballard soils have less than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand particles and have weakly developed (minimal) Bt horizons.  Bohna and Sagaser soils have a paralithic contact at depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Chuloak soils have temperatures in which the difference between mean summer and mean winter is greater then 30 degrees F.  Franciscan soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Gilroy, Shimmon and Soper soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Pinto soils have an abrupt A/B horizon boundary and lack a transitional AB or BA horizon.  Tehachapi soils have a Bt horizon with 25 to 35 percent clay and a slow permeability."

The climate is dry with 12 to 25 inches of precipitation.  The average January temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.; average July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 175 to 300 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils mapped in Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys are now the new tentative Chuloak series.  These soils have temperatures difference between mean summer and mean winter of 30 degrees F. or more.   The soils  mapped near King City are considered taxadjuncts to the series because of slight temperatures differences.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nLast revised by the state on 4/86.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Riverside Laboratory, Pedon No. S64-Calif-27-13\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
