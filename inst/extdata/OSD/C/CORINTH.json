  "OVERVIEW": "The Corinth series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly and moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous clayey shales. These nearly level to moderately steep hills formed on ridgetops and side slopes primarily in the Rolling Plains and Breaks (MLRA 73).  Slope gradients range from 1 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.",
