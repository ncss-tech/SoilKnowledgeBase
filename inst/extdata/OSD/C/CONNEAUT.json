  "OVERVIEW": "The Conneaut series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying low-lime till on Wisconsinan age lake plains. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the subsoil and slow in the lower part and in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Thickness of the silty glaciolacustrine sediments or loess ranges from 16 to 36 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 4 percent in the A and B horizons, 2 to 10 percent in the 2B horizons, and 3 to 10 percent in the 2C horizons. Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to 80 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral. Unplowed areas have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 3 to 6 inches thick that has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.\nThe B and 2B horizons above 30 inches commonly have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 (except one or more subhorizons have chroma of 3 or 4). Below 30 inches they have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Surfaces of peds throughout the B and 2B horizons have chroma of 2 or less. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure of the B horizons are weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky, angular blocky or prismatic. Structure of the 2B horizons are weak or moderate, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky, prismatic or platy. Iron depletions and accumulations are common to many. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part, and slightly acid in the lower part grading to neutral with depth.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 4, and few to many mottles. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. During the period of glacial lakes the till part of this soil was leveled and modified by wave action. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 39 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F. A lake influence moderates spring and fall temperatures. The frost free period is 160 to 198 days, and elevation ranges from 570 to 760 feet above msl."

The moderately well drained Elnora and Harbor soils are on higher landscape positions. The Hornell soils are moderately deep to shale bedrock on nearby landscapes. The excessively drained Otisville and Tyner soils are on nearby beach ridges. The Painesville and Stafford soils have more than 15 percent sand in the control section and are on nearby landscapes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly and somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. In poorly drained areas, frequent brief ponding occurs on depressional landscape positions during periods of heavy rainfall and during spring snowmelt. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the subsoil and slow in the lower part and in the substratum. In poorly drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from +0.5 to 0.5 foot from November to June in most years. In somewhat poorly drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 foot from November to May in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions - begin at a depth of 9 inches.\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 9 to 44 inches (Bg1, Bg2, 2Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons).\nUdic moisture regime.\nThis revision reflects a reversion in drainage class from somewhat poorly drained to its earlier definition as poorly and somewhat poorly drained.\nThe shale substratum phase mapped in the Soil Survey of Lake County, Ohio, published 1979, has shale bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. This phase does not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be correlated as a new series at a future time.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon AB-S14 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sample numbers 15261 to 15269 from Ashtabula County, Ohio; sample analysis by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
