  "OVERVIEW": "The Conneaut series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying low-lime till on Wisconsinan age lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the upper part of the subsoil and low in the lower part and in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 865 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 4 percent in the A and B horizons, 2 to 10 percent in the 2B horizons, and 3 to 10 percent in the 2C horizons. Depth to carbonates ranges from 100 to 200 centimeters.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral. Unplowed areas have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 7 to 15 centimeters thick that has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.\nThe B and 2B horizons above 30 inches commonly have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 (except one or more subhorizons have chroma of 3 or 4). Below 30 inches they have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Surfaces of peds throughout the B and 2B horizons have chroma of 2 or less. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure of the B horizons are weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky, angular blocky or prismatic. Structure of the 2B horizons are weak or moderate, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky, prismatic or platy. Iron depletions and accumulations are common to many. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part, and slightly acid in the lower part grading to neutral with depth.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 4, and few to many mottles. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Conneaut soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying low-lime till and are on slight rises, broad convex flats, depressions and short side slopes along drainageways on Wisconsinan age lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. During the period of glacial lakes the till part of this soil was leveled and modified by wave action. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 735 to 1050 millimeters, and mean annual temperature ranges from 9.5 to 11 degrees C. A lake influence moderates spring and fall temperatures. The frost free period is 160 to 198 days, and elevation ranges from 175 to 260 meters above msl, although this increases a few millimeters each year due to isostatic rebound along Lake Erie."

The excessively drained Harborcreek and Tyner soils are on nearby beach ridges. The Painesville and Stafford soils have more than 15 percent sand in the control section and are on nearby landscapes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly and somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. In poorly drained areas, frequent brief ponding occurs on depressional landscape positions during periods of heavy rainfall and during spring snowmelt. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the upper part of the subsoil and low in the lower part and in the substratum. In poorly drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from +30 centimeters to 30 centimeters from November to June in most years. In somewhat poorly drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 30 centimeters from November to May in most years."

This phase does not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be correlated as a new series at a future time."
