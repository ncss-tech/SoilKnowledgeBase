Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is humid with cold, wet winters and warm, relatively dry summers. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Natural vegetation indicates udic moisture regime.  Classification changed to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Hapludalfs in 1998 due to eighth edition of Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 9 inches (A1, A2, and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
