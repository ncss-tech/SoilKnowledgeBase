  "OVERVIEW": "The Crash series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terrace escarpments.  They formed in silty calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
