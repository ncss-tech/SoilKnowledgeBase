  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weakly consolidated bedrock and the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick and typically includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist in April, May, and early June.  It is dry for 90 cumulative days from mid June to mid October, and 60 consecutive days during this same period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is typically loam or clay loam but silt loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam substrata occur in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nBedrock consists of weakly consolidated calcareous fine grained sandstone interbedded in some areas with thin to moderately thick beds of shale."

The Ascalon, Asparas, Bresser, Capulin, Critchell, Datil, Featherlegs, Harlan, Lavate, Loarc, Moskee, Noden, Palmer Canyon, Recluse, Satanta, Shalona, Sugardee, Wages, and Wolf soils are deep. Chacuaco,  Dagflat and Ryegate soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Hargreave soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Hemingford soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Hiarc and Rosebud soils are not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 consecutive days in the four months following July 15 in most years.  Hiarc soils also have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 52 degrees F.  Kirtley soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cedak soils are on hills, alluvial fans, hillslopes and valley floors. These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from fine grained calcareous sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent and are typically simple. Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 19 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June. The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is estimated to range from 110 to 120 days."
