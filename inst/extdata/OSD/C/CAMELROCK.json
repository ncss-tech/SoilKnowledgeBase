    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Camelrock soils are on treads of high stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, schist, and from Tertiary micaceous sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

El Rancho soils are fine-silty, have ochric epipedons and cambic horizons, and occur on fan remnants. Innacutt soils are coarse-loamy, lack diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons, and occur on inset fans and narrow flood plains of gulches.  Walkibout soils are coarse-silty, have ochric epipedons, and occur on side slopes of gulches."
