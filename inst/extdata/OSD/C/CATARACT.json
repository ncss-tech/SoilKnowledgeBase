  "OVERVIEW": "The Cataract series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvium weathered mainly from sandstone and shale. Cataract soils are on lowland benches terraces and fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
