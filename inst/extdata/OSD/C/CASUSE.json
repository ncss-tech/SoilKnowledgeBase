  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of solum are 8 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 to 44 degrees F.  The soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F from February 15 to December 15.  It exceeds 47 degrees F from April 1 to November 15.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to November 15.  It is moist in some or all parts when above 47 degrees F in the 4- to 12-inch zone or to the top of the paralithic contact from April 1 to June 15.  These soils are too thin, too low in organic matter, or have too high moist value or chroma to quality for a mollic epipedon.  They have amorphous materials and ash but are not dominated by these materials.  Cobbles are present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is brown or grayish brown dry and dark brown or very dark brown moist in 10YR or 7.5YR hue.  It is sandy loam or loam and has very weak subangular blocky, or platy structure or is massive.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 4 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with less than 35 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure, is slightly hard or hard, and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is calcareous along fracture seams in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adelanto, Bieber, Cuyama, Delma, McQuarrie, and Tejon series.  Adelanto, Cuyama, and Tejon soils have thermic soil temperature regime and lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  Bieber soils have a clayey control section and have a duripan at depths of less than 20 inches.  Delma soils have a mollic epipedon and have clayey control section.  McQuarrie soils have a mollic epipedon and have a loamy control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Casuse soils are undulating to steep and occur on terraces and highly dissected escarpments at elevations of 4,000 to 4,700 feet.  They formed from weakly cemented tuffs that are high in ash and pumice.  The climate is semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 degrees F; average July temperature is 67 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to100 days."

Karcal soils have cracks that open and close once each year and have slickensides.  Ninekar soils have clayey B2t horizons and are 20 to 40 inches deep over basalt.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY;  Well-drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability."
