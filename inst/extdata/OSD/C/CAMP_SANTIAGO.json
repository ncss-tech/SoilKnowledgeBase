Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and Bt horizons, and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the C and 2C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam,  clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.   Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma 2 to 4.

Arenales and Guamani soils are in adjacent lower flood plains.  In additions, the excessively drained Arenales soils are sandy throughout and Guamani soils are fine-loamy over beds of gravelly and cobbly material.  Coamo soils are on slightly lower positions and have clayey subsoils.  Jacana soils are on similar to lower positions, are moderately deep to semi-consolidated bedrock, and have clayey subsoils."
