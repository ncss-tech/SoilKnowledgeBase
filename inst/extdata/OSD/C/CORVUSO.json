  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Corvuso series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in a fine textured mantle over underlying firm till. These soils are on glacial moraines and till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches). 25 to 102 cm (The 10 to 40 inch) particle size control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay and 5 to 20 percent fine sand and coarser. The lower part of the profile that formed in firm glacial till has 30 to 55 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent sand with a bulk density of 1.6 to 1.8 gm/cc. Rock fragments typically make up 0 to 2 percent of the upper mantle and 2 to 10 percent of the underlying material. Shale is a common component of the gravel size fraction.\nThe A, Ap and Ak horizons have hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.

Corvuso soils formed in a fine textured mantle over underlying firm till. The glacial till in Minnesota is thought to be pre-Wisconsin in age and referred to as Kandiyohi till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is 660 to 813 mm (24 to 32 inches). The frost free days range from 155 to 200days. Elevation above sea level is from 320 to 381 m (1050 to 1250 feet)."

Cosmos, Kandiyohi, Lura and Strout soils form a hydrosequence associated with Corvuso soils. The moderately well drained Arkton and Newlondon soils are calcareous throughout and are on shoulder slopes. The moderately well drained Strout soils are on summits, shoulders slopes, and back slopes. The somewhat poorly drained Kandiyohi soils are on summits and low rises. The poorly drained Cosmos soils do not have carbonates in the upper part of the profile. The poorly drained Danielson soils are on foot slopes and have a thicker mollic epipedon. The very poorly drained Lura soils are in closed depressions."
