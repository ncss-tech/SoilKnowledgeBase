    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The upper mantle is discontinuous over short distances but ranges up to127 cm (50 inches) in thickness. The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches). 25 to 102 cm (The 10 to 40 inch) particle size control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay and 5 to 20 percent fine sand and coarser. The lower part of the profile that formed in firm glacial till has 30 to 55 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent sand with a bulk density of 1.6 to 1.8 gm/cc. Rock fragments typically make up 0 to 2 percent of the upper mantle and 2 to 10 percent of the underlying material. Shale is a common component of the gravel size fraction.\nThe A, Ap and Ak horizons have hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is silty clay loam, clay, silty clay or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nThe AB horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, clay, silty clay or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Ped exteriors have common to many coatings of organic matter that commonly are 1 value darker than ped interiors. Calcium carbonate is disseminated throughout or is in the form of threads and masses. Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Calcium carbonate is disseminated throughout or is in the form of threads and masses. Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is typically clay loam but includes clay or silty clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Corvuso soils are on plane and slightly convex positions on rims of closed depressions. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Corvuso soils formed in a fine textured mantle over underlying firm till. The glacial till in Minnesota is thought to be pre-Wisconsin in age and referred to as Kandiyohi till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is 660 to 813 mm (24 to 32 inches). The frost free days range from 155 to 200days. Elevation above sea level is from 320 to 381 m (1050 to 1250 feet)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arkton, Cosmos , Danielson , Kandiyohi , Lura, Newlondon , and Strout soils. Cosmos, Kandiyohi, Lura and Strout soils form a hydrosequence associated with Corvuso soils. The moderately well drained Arkton and Newlondon soils are calcareous throughout and are on shoulder slopes. The moderately well drained Strout soils are on summits, shoulders slopes, and back slopes. The somewhat poorly drained Kandiyohi soils are on summits and low rises. The poorly drained Cosmos soils do not have carbonates in the upper part of the profile. The poorly drained Danielson soils are on foot slopes and have a thicker mollic epipedon. The very poorly drained Lura soils are in closed depressions."

The saturated hydraulic conductivity is .42 to 1.41 micrometers per second (.06 to .2 inches per hour).  Perched and apparent saturation is as high as 15 cm (0.5 foot) at some time from November through June in normal years. Perched conditions typically exist early in spring and/or during periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt."
