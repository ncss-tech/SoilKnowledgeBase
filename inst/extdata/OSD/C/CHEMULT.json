  "OVERVIEW": "The Chemult series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on flood plains of a lava plateau. These soils formed in grassy organic material over diatomaceous earth over alluvium from pumice. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
