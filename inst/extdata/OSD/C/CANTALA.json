  "OVERVIEW": "The Cantala series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed loess and ash over stratified alluvium.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soil is usually moist but is dry for 80 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 4-month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick and depth to bedrock is 40 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Organic matter decreases to less than 1 percent above a depth of 20 inches and commonly between 10 and 15 inches.  The solum is neutral but the soil ranges to mildly or moderately alkaline below depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 thru 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has weak to moderate structure.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam.\nStratified sandy or silty materials are below depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

Summers are warm and dry with a mean summer temperature of 62 to 66 degrees F.  Winters are cool and moist with a mean winter temperature of 31 to 35 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches annually.  The frost-free period is 100 to 165 days."
