  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 100 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Fragments of siliceous pebbles and sandstone conglomerate or sandstone cover 2 to 20 percent of the soil surface.  These fragments range from about 3 to 48 inches across the long axis.  Most of the fragments are 10 to about 30 inches across.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has colors with 1 to 2 units of value or chroma greater than the A horizon.  Siliceous and sandstone pebbles range from a few to 35 percent by volume.  Also, fragments of conglomerate and sandstone that range from 3 to 48 inches across make up 5 to 30 percent by volume of these horizons.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The Bt2 or lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled with these colors in some pedons.  Grayish fragments of weathered shaley materials are also in the lower part of some pedons.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Siliceous or sandstone pebbles, cobbles, and stones range from none to 12 percent by volume.  However, the upper part of the Bt1 horizon contains up to 35 percent by volume pebbles and cobbles in some pedons.  The reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BCt and C horizons are in shades of yellow, brown, or gray with or without mottles of these colors or reddish mottles.  Texture is clay, or sandy clay or is shale with or without strata of loamy materials.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from none to a few in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Callisburg, Chigley, Edge, Hamby, Margie, Minwells, Truce, Voca and Windthorst soils in the same family.  Callisburg soils have sola thicker than 60 inches and lack colors with hue 5YR or redder.  Chigley soils typically have a gravelly Bt horizon and are underlain by a lithic contact of conglomerate. Hamby soils are more alkaline in the upper Bt horizon and have a thicker sola.  Margie soils have sola more than 60 inches thick and lack stony surface layers.   Minwells soils are underlain by beds of sand and gravel. They also lack stony surfaces.  Truce soils are more alkaline in the upper Bt horizons and typically have calcareous lower layers.  Voca soils developed in residuum from weathered granite and have a paralithic contact of granitic materials at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Edge and Windthorst soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick and lack stony surface layers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cona soils are on erosional uplands.  Soil areas are convex, with slope gradients of 3 to 25 percent but are dominantly 5 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in sediments such as that of the basal Trinity Formation which includes clays, shales, and quartz conglomerates of Lower Cretaceous age.  The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 66 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 28 to 32 inches.  Frost free period is 220 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 900 to 1200 feet.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 44 to 50."

Bonti soils are underlain by a lithic contact of sandstone.  Chaney and Selden soils are members of an Aquic subgroup.  Bonti soils are on higher positions.  The other soils are below the Cona soils.  However, Windthorst soils are also on similar positions."
