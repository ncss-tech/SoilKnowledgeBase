  "OVERVIEW": "The Collegecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on toeslopes, fans and terraces of dissected plateaus. Collegecreek soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvial and alluvial material derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
