  "OVERVIEW": "The Chimrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Chimrock soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, and plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
