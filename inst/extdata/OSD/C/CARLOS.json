  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material including one or more layers of marl with an aggregate thickness of 2 to about 18 inches, extends to depths of more than 51 inches, typically 51 to 100 inches.  In some pedons the marl forms a continuous relatively thick layer below the organic soil materials.  The organic materials are primarily herbaceous, but in some pedons they are partly derived from Hypnum moss.  Woody fibers and fragments typically are lacking, but a small amount are in the upper tier of some pedons.  Snail shells or fragments or both commonly comprise as much as 10 percent of the volume.  The organic soil material contains 15 to 50 percent mineral material.  Typically the organic soil material has free carbonates in all parts with a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 35 percent.  However, pedons that lack free carbonates in some layers are not excluded from the series.  The organic soil materials range from neutral to mildly alkaline in 0.01 molar calcium chloride.  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 38 to 47 degrees F.  These soils commonly are saturated with water during most of the year unless artificially drained.\nHemic material is dominant in the control section.  The broken face of this material has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Value or chroma or both decrease as much as one unit after rubbing in some pedons.  Fiber content typically ranges from 35 to 55 percent and from 15 to 30 percent after rubbing.  This material is massive or has weak platy structure.  Some pedons have layers of sapric soil material in the surface tier that have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 on the broken face.  Value or chroma or both commonly decrease by one unit after rubbing.  This material is massive or has a weak granular or blocky structure.\nThe Lca horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is relatively low in bulk density and feels like a silt loam.  It is massive.  Mineral content ranges from 65 to 95 percent and the calcium carbonate equivalent is 30 to more than 50 percent.  It commonly contains snail shells with some marl layers containing as much as 20 percent by volume.  In some Lca horizons plant detritus comprises up to 20 percent of the volume.  It ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline in 0.01 molar calcium chloride."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in this family.  Closely related series are the Brophy, Millerville, Rifle, and Rondeau series.  The Brophy soils have fibric organic soil materials consisting mostly of Hypnum moss in the subsurface tier.  The Millerville soils have layers of coprogenous earth in the control section and lack layers of marl.  The Rifle soils lack limnic layers above depths of 51 inches.  The Rondeau soils are dominated by sapric soil materials in the organic portion of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carlos soils are on plane level positions in bogs primarily in wide sluggish, low gradient drainageways within glacial moraines, outwash plains, and valley trains.  Sufficient gradient exists in these areas to cause significant lateral movement of water.  These soils formed in organic soil material derived from herbaceous plants and layers of marl 2 inches or more thick within a depth of 51 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 36 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 35 inches or more."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was classified as a Bog or Half-Bog soil in the former system.  Further consideration needs to bee given as to whether this series should be restricted to soils consisting only of thin marly strata between layers of organic soil material or whether it also should include soils consisting of organic soil materials over rather thick continuous layers of marl.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES No. 69-21-11-1 for results of some laboratory analysis of the typifying pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
