    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cortez soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.   Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (A1, A2, and BAtn horizons).\nAbrupt textural change -The boundary at 25 cm (Between the BAtn and 2Btnss horizons).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 25 to 56 cm (2Btnss and 2Btnk horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 38 to 122 cm (2Btnk and 2Bqkm horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 56 to 122 cm (2Bqkm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 56 cm (2Btnss and 2Btnk horizons).\nThe revision of November 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Natridurids based on the parent material for the eolian mantle and laboratory data on sand mineralogy for adjacent soils.  Volcanic glass contents and oxalate extractable aluminum and iron values in the A horizons are estimated.\nThe BAtn horizon does not qualify as an argillic horizon nor is it part of the natric horizon because it lacks the required increase in clay content.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Riverside, CA as soil survey sample number S66NV-011-002 (pedon # 40A3167).  The data is published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23 on pages 38-39.  Soil pH values in the typical pedon were determined in a soil-water (1:10) solution.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
