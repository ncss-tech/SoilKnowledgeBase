  "OVERVIEW": "The Cortez series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Cortez soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Volcanic glass contents and oxalate extractable aluminum and iron values in the A horizons are estimated.\nThe BAtn horizon does not qualify as an argillic horizon nor is it part of the natric horizon because it lacks the required increase in clay content."
