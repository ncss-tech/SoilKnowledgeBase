  "OVERVIEW": "The Chapel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playa basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 millimeters (19 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
