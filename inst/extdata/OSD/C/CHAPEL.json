It includes western wheatgrass, buffalograss, blue grama, vine mesquite, Texas blueweed, kochia, western ragweed, cocklebur, sunflower, and mares-tail. Bur ragweed, sedges, spike rush, bushy knotweed, frog-fruit, and saltmarsh aster may occur in wetter areas. This soil has been correlated to the Playa (077CY027TX) range site in MLRA-77."
