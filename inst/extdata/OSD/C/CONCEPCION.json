  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 58 degrees to 60 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean winter soil temperature is about 58 degrees F.  Soil between depths of about 5 to 15 inches is usually moist in some part after the first of November until sometime in May and is dry all the rest of the year. The base saturation exceeds 50 percent in all parts.\nThe A1 horizon is grayish brown or dark grayish brown in 10YR hue. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and has 1 to 3 percent organic matter. This horizon is strongly or medium acid and usually has weak granular or weak subangular blocky structure. Some cultivated pedons are massive.\nThe A2 horizon is light brownish gray, light gray, light grayish brown or very pale brown in 10YR hue. Small (1 to 5 mm) manganese concretions that make up 1 to 5 percent of the A2 horizon are present in the profiles with loamy sand textures. This horizon has the same texture as the A1 horizon. Organic matter is less than 1 percent. Some pedons have common distinct mottles in the A2 horizon.\nThe B2t horizon is mottled and has yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown, dark brown, brown, brownish yellow, pale brown, light brownish gray, dark grayish brown, dark reddish brown, dark gray or gray colors in 10YR or 5YR hue and reddish brown, dark reddish brown in 5YR or 2.5YR hue. It is clay, heavy clay loam or sandy clay. This horizon has medium or strong medium or coarse angular blocky structure in the lower part. It is typically strongly or medium acid but ranges to moderately alkaline in some pedons. The sodium absorption ratio is greater than 6."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation is 40 to 200 feet. The soils formed on weakly consolidated stratified alluvium or wind-deposited sandy material blown form nearby beaches. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool, rainless, but foggy summers, and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches. Average January temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F., average July temperature is 63 degrees to 68 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 56 degrees to 62 degrees F. The average frost-free season is 300 to 330 days."

Botella soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have 2 to 6 percent organic matter to depths greater than 20 inches. Diablo soils are clayey throughout.  Lopez soils are shaly and have a lithic contact at depths of 6 to 20 inches. Milpitas, Positas and Tierra soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Santa Lucia soils are shaly and have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
