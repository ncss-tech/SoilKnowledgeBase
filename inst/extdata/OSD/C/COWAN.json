    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cowan soils are on flood plains and low terraces at elevations of 2,200 to 4,500 feet. Dominant slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The climate is warm arid and semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 70 degrees F. The freeze-free period ranges from 160 to 260 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches. In some areas the precipitation is as low as 10 inches."
