  "OVERVIEW": "The Clark series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Clark soils are on paleoterraces on river valleys in the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",

Revised the Geographically Association Soils paragraph.\n12/2012 DJK - Edited climate data in intro and geographic setting. Added clay, sand, and rock fragments to horizons in RIC. Updated geographically associated soils (deleted Avans, Bethany, Blanket, Case, Farnum, Naron, and Penalosa and added Kanza, Ninniscah, and Shellabarger). Edited runoff to actual classes. Added cambic horizon to remarks.  Removed central Oklahoma from Distribution and Extent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
