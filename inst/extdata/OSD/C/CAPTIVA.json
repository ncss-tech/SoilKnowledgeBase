  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Captiva series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very rapidly permeable soils on broad, low flats near the Gulf Coast.  They formed in thick marine deposits of sand and shell fragments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

Texture is to depths of 80 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of shell fragments ranges from about 10 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is a mixture of fine sand, sand, or coarse sand and multicolored shells or shell fragments.  Shell fragments greater than 2 mm in size comprise less than 35 percent, by volume.  Redoximorphic features and streaks in shades of gray or brown range from few to common.  Texture is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic great group - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon).\nInternal drainage is impeded by a shallow water table.  The water table is within depths of 10 inches for 1 to 2 months during the normal summer rainy season and other periods of high rainfall.  It is within depths of 10 to 40 inches for 10 months during most years.  In some years the soil is covered by standing water for several days.\nThese soils were formerly included in the Canaveral series."
