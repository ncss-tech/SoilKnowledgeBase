Texture is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is a mixture of fine sand, sand, or coarse sand and multicolored shells or shell fragments.  Shell fragments greater than 2 mm in size comprise less than 35 percent, by volume.  Redoximorphic features and streaks in shades of gray or brown range from few to common.  Texture is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic great group - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon).\nInternal drainage is impeded by a shallow water table.  The water table is within depths of 10 inches for 1 to 2 months during the normal summer rainy season and other periods of high rainfall.  It is within depths of 10 to 40 inches for 10 months during most years.  In some years the soil is covered by standing water for several days.\nThese soils were formerly included in the Canaveral series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
