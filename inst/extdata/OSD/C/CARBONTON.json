  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to paralithic contact with weathered bedrock (Cr) ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to a lithic contact with unweathered bedrock (R) is 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments are less than 35 percent by volume in the A or Ap horizon, less than 15 percent by volume in the E, BE, Bt, and BCt horizons, and less than 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. Exchangeable aluminum is high (greater than 10 meq/100g). Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some subhorizons may have a value of 3. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in the lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam. The particle size control section averages more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BCt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons may contain mottles in shades of yellow or brown. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, highly fractured, Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale.\nThe R horizon, where present, is unweathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brickhaven and Capshaw series in the same family. Brickhaven soils have Cr horizons within 40 to 60 inches of the surface. Capshaw soils have a solum thickness ranging from 40 to 60 inches, formed in old clayey alluvium and lack the high aluminum concentrations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carbonton soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on ridges and hill slopes in the Triassic Basins of the thermic Southern Piedmont. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 53 inches."

The well drained to moderately well drained Hallison soils are fine-silty, deep to Cr, and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. The moderately well drained Mooshaunee soils are fine-silty and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. The well drained Peakin soils are very deep and are on ridges and sideslopes. The well\ndrained Pinoka soils are fine-loamy and are on ridges and shoulder slopes. The well drained Mayodan and moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Creedmoor soils do not have a Cr horizon within 60 inches and are on ridges and hill slopes. The moderately well drained Polkton and White Store soils and the somewhat poorly drained Green Level soils have a very high shrink-swell potential and are on ridges and hill slopes. In addition, White Store soils are deep to a Cr horizon and Green Level soils are very deep."
