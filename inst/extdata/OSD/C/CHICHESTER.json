The soils formed in a loamy mantle underlain by sandy supraglacial till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from granitic, and gneissic rocks but includes schist, quartzite and amphibolite.  The till typically contains stones and/or boulders.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 through 7 degress C. (40 through 45 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 125 cm.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days."

Becket and Skerry soils have spodic horizons, formed in dense till and are at higher latitudes and elevations.  Henniker and the moderately well drained Metacomet soils formed in dense till on nearby landscapes.  The poorly drained Pillsbury and very poorly drained Peacham soils are along drainageways and depressions in the landscape.  Millsite and Woodstock soils, moderately deep and shallow to bedrock respectively, are on nearby bedrock controlled landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The Chichester series was proposed to recognize frigid Typic Dystrudepts formed in a loamy mantle overlying sandy, friable till. The spodosol analogue is the Monadnock series.  The mesic analogue is the Canton series.\n2.  The series name originates from a town in southern New Hampshire, just east of Concord. The town was named to honor Thomas Pelham Holles, Duke of Newcastle and Earl of Chichester, England, an influential politician during the 18th century who was immersed in the interactions between England and the American colonies.\n3. The source of reaction documented for the type location is NSSL characterization; pH in water.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Oe, A and Ap horizons).  After mixing the upper 18 cm of mineral material, dry color is light brownish gray  (10YR 6/2).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 50 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\n3. Contrasting particle size: upper part; coarse-loamy 25 to 50 cm, lower part; sandy or sandy skeletal: 50 to 100 cm\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type location was sampled for characterization, National Soil Survey Laboratory, Pedon ID 00MA-011-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
