Rock fragments are dominantly granite and gneiss gravel and cobbles.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe 0 horizon, where present, consists of fibric, hemic or sapric material. It has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe A horizon where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium granular, or weak fine subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon (5 cm thick or less) that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak fine granular or weak medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and value and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Structure is weak medium or fine subangular blocky and some pedons have horizons that are massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak medium subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family.  Abenecki, Monadnock and Canton soils are in closely related families.  Abenecki soils formed in alluvial deposits underlain by water deposited sands and gravel.  Canton soils have a higher mean annual temperature.  Monadnock soils have a spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chichester soils are gently sloping to very steep soils on glaciated upland plains, hills, ridges, footslopes and valley walls.  Slope ranges from 3 to 50 percent. The soils formed in a loamy mantle underlain by sandy supraglacial till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from granitic, and gneissic rocks but includes schist, quartzite and amphibolite.  The till typically contains stones and/or boulders.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 through 7 degress C. (40 through 45 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 125 cm.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days."

Becket and Skerry soils have spodic horizons, formed in dense till and are at higher latitudes and elevations.  Henniker and the moderately well drained Metacomet soils formed in dense till on nearby landscapes.  The poorly drained Pillsbury and very poorly drained Peacham soils are along drainageways and depressions in the landscape.  Millsite and Woodstock soils, moderately deep and shallow to bedrock respectively, are on nearby bedrock controlled landscapes."

Principle species include red maple, sugar maple, white oak, red oak, yellow birch, paper birch, American Beech, eastern white pine and eastern hemlock.  Areas cleared of trees and stones are used primarily for crops, hay and pasture.  Small areas are used for residential development."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The Chichester series was proposed to recognize frigid Typic Dystrudepts formed in a loamy mantle overlying sandy, friable till. The spodosol analogue is the Monadnock series.  The mesic analogue is the Canton series.\n2.  The series name originates from a town in southern New Hampshire, just east of Concord. The town was named to honor Thomas Pelham Holles, Duke of Newcastle and Earl of Chichester, England, an influential politician during the 18th century who was immersed in the interactions between England and the American colonies.\n3. The source of reaction documented for the type location is NSSL characterization; pH in water.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Oe, A and Ap horizons).  After mixing the upper 18 cm of mineral material, dry color is light brownish gray  (10YR 6/2).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 50 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\n3. Contrasting particle size: upper part; coarse-loamy 25 to 50 cm, lower part; sandy or sandy skeletal: 50 to 100 cm\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type location was sampled for characterization, National Soil Survey Laboratory, Pedon ID 00MA-011-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
