  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuyamaca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and other igneous sources. Cuyamaca soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
