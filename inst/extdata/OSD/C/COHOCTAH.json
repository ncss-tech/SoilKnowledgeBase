  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils are the Ceresco, Gilford, Glendora, Lyles, and Sloan series. Ceresco soils do not have dominant gray colors just below the mollic epipedon. Gilford and Lyles soils have a regular decrease in organic matter content with increasing depth. Glendora soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Sloan soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.1 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 351 meters (580 feet to 1,150 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Ceresco soils and the well drained Landes soils are in a drainage sequence with the Cohoctah soils. The moderately well drained Abscota soils are on higher rises, the somewhat poorly drained Algansee soils are on slightly higher rises, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Glendora soils are on similar landforms and are commonly on the same flood plain but have a sandy particle-size control sections. The somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils are on slightly higher positions and the very poorly drained Sloan soils are on similar landforms; both have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and commonly are on the same flood plain."

The depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from near the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface from September to May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. The soil is commonly flooded for brief to long periods of time from November to May."

The main part is in permanent pasture, woodland, or brush. Native vegetation is red maple, white ash, swamp white oak, American elm, alder, and quaking aspen."
