  "OVERVIEW": "The Cohoctah series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvial deposits on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils are on slightly higher positions and the very poorly drained Sloan soils are on similar landforms; both have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and commonly are on the same flood plain."
