Cleavmor soils contain a Btk horizon with few to many filaments of lime. Cropper and Gaciba soils have a mollic epipedon that includes the upper part of the Bt horizon. Horsetrack soils are less than 36 cm to bedrock.  Mascamp soils have a mollic epipedon that includes all or part of the argillic horizon and has segregated lime in the lower part of the argillic horizon or coating bedrock.  Pernty soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon. Shalper and Slater soils are less than 30 cm deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cleavage soils are on plateaus, hills or mountain crests, summits, shoulders, ridges and sideslopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite, welded tuffs, chert, shale, quartzite, sandstone or conglomerate and other shallow igneous and sedimentary rocks with some colluvial influence from mixed rocks.   Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are normally 1,615 to 2,680 meters and range to 1,460 meters on north aspects in Idaho and 1,158 meters in Oregon.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm; mean annual air temperature is normally 6 to 7 degrees C. and ranges down to 3 degrees C. The frost free season is typically 80 to 100 and ranges to 60 days in parts of Idaho and 40 days in parts of Oregon."
