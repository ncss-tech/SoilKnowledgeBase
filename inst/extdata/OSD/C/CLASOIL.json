  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clasoil series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash derived from granitic and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills, fan remnants, alluvial fans, stream terraces and outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
