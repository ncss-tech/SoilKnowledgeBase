    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches). The mollic epipedon ranges from 61 to 91 centimeters (24 to 36 inches) in thickness. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 46 to 152 centimeters (18 to 60 inches) or more. The control section has between 18 and 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent of fine sand and coarser. A small amount of gypsum is in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. It has redoximorphic features in some pedons. It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. It typically is neutral or slightly alkaline but ranges to moderately acid in subhorizons in some pedons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral;value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BCg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. They have faint through distinct redoximorphic features in some to all parts. They typically are loam or clay loam, but have subhorizons of silt loam or silty clay loam in some pedons. Also, they have coarser textured subhorizons below depths of 40 inches in some pedons. They are neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part and slightly or moderately alkaline in the lower part. Rock fragment content is less than 15 percent."

Coland soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and have free carbonates beginning at greater depths. Delft and Glencoe soils have more coarse fragments and are on upland. James Canyon, Kimmerling, McClave, Peoh, and Wenas are in drier climates. Konner soils are in a drier climate and lack free carbonates within a depth of 60 inches. Romnell soils have gypsum throughout their sola. Shandep soils have a coarse-textured substratum. Excello and Cielow soils have a mean annual soil temperature of greater than 12 degrees C. Gus and Keddie soils do not have carbonates in the series control section. Lundlake soils have rock fragments in the series control section."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 560 to 810 millimeters (22 to 32 inches). Annual frost free days are 150 to 180. Elevation ranges from 350 to 549 meters (1150 to 1800 feet) above sea level."
