  "OVERVIEW": "The Crestvale series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained saline soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvium.  Crestvale soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Calcium sulfate in the salic and gypsic horizons ranges from 10 to about 20 percent more than the underlying material.  Soluble salts in the salic horizon range from 2 to 8 percent.  Clay content in the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent, and sand coarser than very fine sand ranges from 15 to 50 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.\nThe Ayz horizon has hue of 10YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It commonly is loam or light clay loam.\nThe Byz horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is usually loam or clay loam.\nThe Ckg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It commonly is clay loam to a depth of about 40 inches and sandy loam or light sandy loam below depths of 40 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Cambic Gypsiorthid to be compatible with the 1994 revisions to National Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:  an ochric epipedon; a salic horizon from 0 to 21 inches; a gypsic horizon from 0 to 21 inches; watertable at 2.5 to 3.5 feet during the growing season; redox features from 30 to 60 inches; visible gypsum as crystals in the Ayz and Byz horizons; visible carbonates in the Ck horizon; an aquic moisture regime; and a frigid temperature regime.  Last updated by the state 6/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
