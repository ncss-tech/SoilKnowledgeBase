  "OVERVIEW": "The Cliffhouse series consists of well to moderately well drained soils formed in thin silty eolian or alluvial materials overlying fine textured materials weathered residually from sedimentary bedrocks.  Cliffhouse soils are on nearly level to gently sloping mesa tops and ridge crests.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Typically, Cliffhouse soils have grayish brown very friable granular noncalcareous A horizons, brown noncalcareous very fine sandy clay loam B21t horizons have prismatic and blocky structure, and light yellowish brown clay IIB22t horizons over soft sedimentary rock at a depth of 30 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are normally noncalcareous throughout but have thin weakly calcareous discontinuous subhorizons just above the bedrock in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  A majority of subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the lithological discontinuity and from 0 to 15 percent in the lower solum and C horizons.  These are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 though 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically loam, clay loam, or very fine sandy clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt 5 to 65 percent, and sand 5 to 70 percent with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe IIB2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically clay or sandy clay but clay ranges from 35 to 55 percent, silt 5 to 65 percent, and sand 5 to 70 percent with at least 20 percent more clay than in the overlying horizon.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Chapin soils lack a lithologic discontinuity above the bedrock and are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  Falfa soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches and have solums more than 50 inches thick.  Roubideau soils have an ochric epipedon and are moderately fine textured."
