  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are normally noncalcareous throughout but have thin weakly calcareous discontinuous subhorizons just above the bedrock in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  A majority of subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the lithological discontinuity and from 0 to 15 percent in the lower solum and C horizons.  These are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 though 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically loam, clay loam, or very fine sandy clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt 5 to 65 percent, and sand 5 to 70 percent with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe IIB2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically clay or sandy clay but clay ranges from 35 to 55 percent, silt 5 to 65 percent, and sand 5 to 70 percent with at least 20 percent more clay than in the overlying horizon.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chapin, Falfa, and Roubideau series.  Chapin soils lack a lithologic discontinuity above the bedrock and are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  Falfa soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches and have solums more than 50 inches thick.  Roubideau soils have an ochric epipedon and are moderately fine textured."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cliffhouse soils are on nearly level to gently sloping mesa tops and hill and ridge crests.  Slopes typically range from about 0 to 12 percent or more.  The soil formed in thin silty eolian or alluvial materials overlying fine textured materials weathered residually from sedimentary bedrocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches with nearly equal amounts in all months.  Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F."
