  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chacuaco series consists of moderately deep to sandtone bedrock, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments, slope alluvium, and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. Chacuaco soils are on ridges and interfluves of plains and on valley sides of plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
