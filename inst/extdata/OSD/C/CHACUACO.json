(Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 20 to 30 inches. (Bk horizon)\nLithic contact: bedrock at 30 inches. (top of R layer)\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe soil was previously mapped within the Ryegate soil, but was determined to average less than 45 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section. This soil is pronounced Cha-kwock.
