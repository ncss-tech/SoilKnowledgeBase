Rock fragments are mostly subrounded and rounded sandstone and chert graveland range from 0 to 5 percent in the A horizon, from 0 to 30 percent in the B horizon, and from 0 to 40 percent below the solum. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some profiles may have a buried argillic horizon below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is  loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Mottles and redoximorphic features are in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray and range from few to many. Texture is silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Mottles and redoximorphic features are in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray and range from few to many. Texture is sandy loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam. Below 50 inches texture may include their gravelly analogues."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families include Atkins, Holderton, and Wehadkee series. Atkins soils are in a fine-loamy, acid family, are the mesic temperature regime, and formed in alluvium washed from acid shale and sandstone. Holderton soils are in a mesic temperature regime and formed in alluvium from glacial drift.  Wehadkee soils are in a fine loamy family and formed in alluvium from the Blue Ridge and Southern Peidmont MLRA's."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cranmore soils are on nearly level flood plains, and in depressions. They also occur occasionally in small drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The typical pedon is located in a valley that receives alluvium from both the Cumberland Plateau and Mountains and the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys MLRA's. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, shales, siltstone and limestone. The mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 55 inches near the type location."

Allen soils, on adjacent uplands and footslopes, are deep, well drained, and have an argillic horizon. Shady soils, on adjacent terraces, are well drained and have an argillic horizon. Hamblen soils, on flood plains at slightly higher elevations, are moderately well drained. Pettyjon soils, on flood plains at slightly higher elevations, are well drained."
