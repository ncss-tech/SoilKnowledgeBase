It is strongly acid or slighty acid.  It has 3 to 6 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the upper part and 10YR or 2.5Y in the lower part, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay; clay content increases with depth.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Base saturation by sum is 50 to 75 percent."

Cornutt soils have a Ca/Mg ratio of more than 1, have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the subsoil, and depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Freezener soils have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR throughout, and formed over basic igneous rock.  Greengulch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and formed over granodiorite.  Jumpoff soils are moderately well drained, and are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section during the summer.  Mildred soils are 20 to 40 inches to soft bedrock and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days in the moisture control section during the summer.  Oak Grove soils have an umbric epipedon, and lack hue more yellow than 7.5YR in the subsoil.  Oakland soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Rainier soils are moderately well drained, and are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Sweetbriar soils have a mollic epipedon, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section during the summer.  Veneta soils are moderately well drained, and have 60 percent or more clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nArgillic horizon - from 14 to 60 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)\nUltic intergrade - base saturation is assumed to be less than 75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nMollic intergrade - color value moist of 3 in the A horizon with more than 0.7 percent organic carbon.\nParticle-size control section - from 14 to 34 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and part of the Bt3 horizons); estimated average clay content is about 40 percent.\nThis does not qualify as a \"Pale\" because the lower part of the argillic does not have a hue redder than 10YR.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the classification in 10/2005. The competing series section was not updated at that time. Last revision 3/1995.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
