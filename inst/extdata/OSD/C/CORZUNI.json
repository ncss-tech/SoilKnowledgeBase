  "REVDATE": "07/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Corzuni series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian and fan alluvium derived from sandstone. Corzuni soils are on dipslopes of cuestas and fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
