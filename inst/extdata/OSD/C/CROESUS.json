Bagerton, Behanin, Boydhollow, Bullrey, Busterback, Dressel, Gateview, Harcany, Hobacker, Lionhead, Lolon, Marcetta, Mundos, Nazaton, Papaspila, Parkcity, Povey, Snagcreek and Snopoc soils are very deep.  Behanco, Tonigut, and Warshod soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Belsac soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Hapgood and Poleline soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Namela soils have cambic horizons. Goodski soils have a mean annual summer temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C and lack significant summer moisture from convection storms. Nagitsy soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Nevtah soils do not have horizons with secondary carbonates and have pararock fragments of tuff in the particle-size control section.  Splitbutte soils have mean annual soil temperature of 4 to 5 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Croesus soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope, shoulder, and summit positions.  Some of these positions are concave on north aspects and are locally known as \"snow pockets\".  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone, quartzite, conglomerate, rhyolite, or dacite with minor amounts of limestone in some areas.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,050 to 3,235 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
