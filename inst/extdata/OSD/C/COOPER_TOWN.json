In natural conditions, flooding occurs for very long duration of 9 to 11 months. Tree Islands are occasionally flooded for brief periods during periods of heavy rainfall, severe storms, and hurricanes. Currently flooding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.\nPonding frequency and duration: depressions on flatwoods areas are covered by water (ponded) very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months."
