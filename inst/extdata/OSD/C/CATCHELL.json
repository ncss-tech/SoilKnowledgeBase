  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on plug domes (buttes), lava flow lobes, pressure ridges and tumuli on shield volcanoes and lava plains, and on structural benches, mesas, buttes, and foothills with slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,800 to 5,300 feet.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt or welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry.  The average annual temperature is about 45 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit,  and the average annual precipitation is about 8 to l3 inches, including up to 3 feet of snow.  The frost-free period is about 90 to l50 days."
