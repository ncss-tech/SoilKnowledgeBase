  "OVERVIEW": "The Catchell series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess over silty alluvium from loess and weathered of volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt or welded rhyolitic tuff.  They are on lava plains, structural benches, mesas, buttes, and foothills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and average annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Elevation ranges from 850 to 1625 meters.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt or welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry.  The average annual temperature is about 7 to 12 degrees C,  and the average annual precipitation is about 200 to 330 mm, including up to 910 mm of snow.  The frost-free period is about 90 to 150 days."
