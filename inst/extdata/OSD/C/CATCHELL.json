  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Catchell series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess over silty alluvium from loess and weathered of volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt or welded rhyolitic tuff.  They are on lava plains, structural benches, mesas, buttes, and foothills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  Average annual precipitation is about l0 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Elevation ranges from 2,800 to 5,300 feet.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt or welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry.  The average annual temperature is about 45 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit,  and the average annual precipitation is about 8 to l3 inches, including up to 3 feet of snow.  The frost-free period is about 90 to l50 days."
