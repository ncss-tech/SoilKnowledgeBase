  "OVERVIEW": "The Coalkiln series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from limestone.  Coalkiln soils are on mountainsides.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
