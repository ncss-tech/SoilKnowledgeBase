  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Capsus series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, and tuff.  Capsus soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
