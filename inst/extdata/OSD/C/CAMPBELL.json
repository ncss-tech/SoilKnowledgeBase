  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Campbell soils occur on nearly level areas on floodplains, the toe of alluvial fans and are marginal to basins. The soils develop in alluvium derived primarily from sedimentary formations. Elevations range from 10 to 400 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool moist winters, warm dry summers and a mean annual rainfall of 14 to 18 inches. The average annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F, with a January mean of 48 degrees F, and a July mean of 65 degrees F, the frost-free season is about 260 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Originally these soils were somewhat poorly drained under natural conditions. Pumping and general lowering of water tables, and levees has made most areas the equivalent of moderately well drained based on depth to water. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderately slow and slow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Original classification of Humaquepts and later classification to Xerochrepts was based on an epipedon that is usually massive and hard under cropland, new data does not support this. Classification changed 11/2009 to Haploxerolls. Despite some wetness, mottles are too deep, below 20 inches, for an aquic suborder and chromas are too bright for an aquic extragrade. Major revision of description resulting from moving the type location during mapping of the Santa Clara Valley in 2006-2008 because the old type location was lost to urbanization.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
