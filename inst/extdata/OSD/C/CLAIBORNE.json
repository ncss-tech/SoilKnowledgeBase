  "OVERVIEW": "The Claiborne series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from limestone.  These soils are on foot slopes, benches and the colluvial portions of side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 100 or more inches.  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from about 6 to 20 or more feet.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil is less acid where limed.  Fragments of chert range from 0 to 25 percent except some subhorizons below the control section ranges up to 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow in the lower part of the Bt horizon. The fine earth fraction is  silty clay loam or clay loam and ranges to clay in the lower part.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon below the Bt horizon."
