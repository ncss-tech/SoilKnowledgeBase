  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 100 or more inches.  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from about 6 to 20 or more feet.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil is less acid where limed.  Fragments of chert range from 0 to 25 percent except some subhorizons below the control section ranges up to 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow in the lower part of the Bt horizon. The fine earth fraction is  silty clay loam or clay loam and ranges to clay in the lower part.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon below the Bt horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from limestone.  Average annual temperature is 54.7 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 60 inches at a station about 20 miles from the type location."

Dunmore soils have clayey subsoils and Clarksville soils are loamy skeletal.  The well drained Huntington soils, moderately well drained Sensabaugh soils  and the somewhat poorly drained Newark soils are on adjacent floodplains and do not have an argillic horizon."
