  "OVERVIEW": "The Combate series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in fan alluvium from granite.  Combate soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
