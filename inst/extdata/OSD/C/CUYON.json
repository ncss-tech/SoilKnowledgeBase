    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of A horizon and depth to the coarse materials range from 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm).  The A horizons are very dark grayish brown, (10YR 3/2) or dark brown (10YR 3/3).  Loam is the dominant type.  Structure is weak fine or moderate medium granular.\nThe C horizons have varying amounts of sand and gravel and less than 10 percent silt.  These soils are neutral or mildly alkaline.  The percent of gravel ranges from 50 to 80 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jacaguas, Mokuleia, Reilly, San Anton, and San German series.  The Jacaguas soils have more clay in the control section and have cambic horizons.  The Mokuleia soils lack the gravel and have carbonatic mineralogy.  The Reilly soils are acid and occur in the more humid areas.  The San Anton soils are moderately fine textures.  The San German soils are calcareous and are underlain by hard limestone at depths of 20 inches or less."

The soil formed in stratified coarse textures sediments of mixed origin.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges for 25 to 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 to 80 degrees F."
