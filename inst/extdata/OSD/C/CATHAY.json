  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It is absent in some cultivated pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and typically averages between 22 and 30 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  It has moderate or strong prismatic structure which parts easily to moderate or strong blocky.  Tonguing or interfingering of E horizon extends into the Bt horizon 1 inch or more, and coats sides of prisms and blocks.  Some pedons have a BE, E/B or B/E horizons.\nThe Bky, Bk, or By horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam or clay loam.  The Bky and Bk horizons commonly contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate.  Accumulations of salts occur below 16 inches in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, less commonly 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam.  Some pedons have pockets of silt, fine sand, and pebbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cathay soils commonly are on level to strongly sloping ground moraines on till plains.  Slope gradients commonly are less than 3 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in till commonly low in clay and containing pockets of silt, fine sands, and other sorted materials.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 20 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cavour, Cresbard, Emrick, Fram, Heimdal, Larson, Letcher, Miranda, Parnell and Tonka soils.  Cavour, Cresbard and Letcher soils are on nearby till and outwash plains.  Cavour soils are fine and do not have tonguing or interfingering of E material. Cresbard soils have a fine textured Bt horizon and formed in fine-loamy till.  Letcher soils are coarse-loamy.  Larson and Miranda soils are in complex with Cathay soils in places.  Larson soils do not have tonguing or interfingering of E material.  Miranda soils have visible gypsum crystals within depths of 16 inches of the surface.  Emrick, Fram and Heimdal soils are on the same till plains.   They do not have natric horizons.  Parnell and Tonka soils are in closed, low-lying depressions and are very poorly drained and poorly drained, respectively.  They do not have natric horizons."
