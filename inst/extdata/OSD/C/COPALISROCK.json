  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Copalisrock series consists of moderately deep to dense glacial till, very poorly drained soils on glacial outwash terraces on till plains. These soils are formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits over gravelly glacial outwash. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevation is 100 to 500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the average frost-free season is 180 to 220 days.",
