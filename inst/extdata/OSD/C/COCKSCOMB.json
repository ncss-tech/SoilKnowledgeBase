  "OVERVIEW": "The Cockscomb series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in basaltic alluvium overlying older mixed alluvium.  Cockscomb soils are on mesas and hills and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
