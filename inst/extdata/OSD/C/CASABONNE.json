  "OVERVIEW": "The Casabonne series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone or shale.  Casabonne soils are deep to lithic or paralithic material with spacing between cracks of less than 10 centimeters apart. Casabonne soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
