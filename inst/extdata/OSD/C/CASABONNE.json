Beal, Dalig, Gunn, Hood, Latourell, Pishpishee, and Rosehaven soils are very deep and do not have lithic material within 100 to 150 centimeters. Boardburn, Boomer, Cherryhill, Cohasset, Crozier, Fives, Fong, Fordcreek, Lettia, Norling, Para, and Tigit soils formed from igneous materials. Cle Elum soils have a paralithic contact at depths within 50 to 100 centimeters. Varelum soils have a paralithic contact at depths within 100 to 150 centimeters. Wohly soils have paralithic materials between 50 and 100 centimeters.  Sanhedrin soils have a mean January temperature less than 7 degrees C."

Elevations are 150 to 1220 meters (500 to 4,000 feet).  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone or shale.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 900 to 2030 millimeters (35 to 80 inches).  Mean January temperature is 9 degrees C (48 degrees F), mean July temperature is 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).  The frost-free period is 150 to 290 days.  Occasional snowfall occurs above 2,500 feet."

The activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. - ET\nThis soil was revised in February 2008 due to the presence of bedrock with cracks mostly closer together than 10 centimeters and coatings on the rock fragments.  The soil lacks a lithic contact - ET.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (O and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon -- the zone from 25 to 127 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3)\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Pedon S80CA-045-020 (Type Location)\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
