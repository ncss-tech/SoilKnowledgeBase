    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Not continuously moist in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days, primarily between February and May. The moisture control section is usually moist from July through December. A water table is present at between 20 to 36 inches during these months unless drained.\nSoil temperature - 77 to 86 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F.  variation between summer and winter.\nDepth to bedrock - 60 to over 80 inches.\nDepth to paralithic contact - 40 to 50 inches.\nPercent clay - 60 to 90 percent in the argillic horizon.\nA horizon - Color:  7.5YR 3/2, 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4.\nTexture:  Texture is silty clay or clay. In uncultivated pedons a thin clay loam or silty clay loam A1 horizon is present.\nReaction:  Medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nRock fragments:  0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nOther features:  In some pedons the A horizon material extends into the B horizon along pores, cracks, and wormholes.\nB horizon - Color:  Dominantly 7.5YR 4/4, 5/6, 5/8, with subordinate colors of 2.5YR 3/6, 4/3, 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 5YR 4/4, 4/6, 4/8 in irregular patches, more abundant with depth.\nStructure:  Angular or subangular blocky.\nReaction:  Strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nOther features:  Manganese concretions, nodules and staining are present in all pedons, but range from 10 to about 40 percent by volume in individual horizons.\nCr horizon - Color:  Matrix is roughly half 7.5YR hues and half 2.5YR and 5YR hues, with values and chroma as in the B horizons. Thin, less than one-half inch thick, seams or joints occupy 5 to 30 percent of the horizon, and are 10YR 5/6, 6/6, 7/2, 7/4, 7/6, 8/l, 2.5YR 7/2, 7/4.  Manganese concretions, nodules, and stainings are common.\nReaction:  Strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level to rolling limestone plateaus, in concave or basin positions. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in sediments derived mostly from argillaceous coralline limestone that overlie volcanic saprolite. Elevation is 200 to 400 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches, most of which falls between June and November. Mean annual temperature is 79 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter."

Kagman soils are moderately well drained, have little or no manganese concretions and do not have volcanic saprolite. Saipan soils have less than 60 percent clay in the B horizons and are well drained."
