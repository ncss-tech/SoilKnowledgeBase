  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Chaseville soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches, and are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches in all pedons.  The upper part of the control section is gravelly or very gravelly coarse sandy loam and has 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  A large part of the sand fraction is medium, coarse, or very coarse angular sand.  The upper part of the control section is 10 to about 25 inches thick.  The lower part of the control section is very gravelly loamy coarse sand or sand thick enough to control the family placement.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter, but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  In some pedons surface horizons are 7.5YR or yellower but a major part of The control section above depth of 50 inches has hue of 5YR or redder.  the mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 5YR through 10R but subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Columbine and Dix series.  Columbine soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and lack a moderately coarse textured layer in the upper part of the control section.  Dix soils have small amounts of coarse and very coarse sand, lack hard-setting properties, and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chaseville soils are on alluvial fans or small stream valleys.  Slope gradients usually range from 1 to 50 percent but range to 70 percent in some areas.  The soils formed in alluvial materials derived from arkose beds.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 125 to 150 days."
