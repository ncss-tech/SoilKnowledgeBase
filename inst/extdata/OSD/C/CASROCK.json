Burnscreek, Frantz, Oland, Schiller and Woolstalf series have mean annual air temperatures ranging from 45 to 54 degrees F. Burnscreek soils occur on valley fans and terraces. Franz soils are developed from olivine gabbro. Oland soils are very deep and were developed from granitic rocks. Schiller soils are very deep. Woolstalf soils are deep to a paralithic contact of sedimentary rocks and occur in the southern Sierra Nevada at elevations of 5000 to 8300 feet."
