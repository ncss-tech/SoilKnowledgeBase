  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chiara soils are summits, shoulders and side slopes fan remnants and plateaus. These soils formed in a loess mantle high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent, but dominantly 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,100 to 2,130 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
