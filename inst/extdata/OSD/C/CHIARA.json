  "OVERVIEW": "The Chiara series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash. The Chiara soils are on summits shoulders and side slopes of fan remnants and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
