  "OVERVIEW": "The Claprych series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately and moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on terraces, hills, and benches.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation is 4,600 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.",
