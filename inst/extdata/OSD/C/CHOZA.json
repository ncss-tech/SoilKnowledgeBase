  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Choza series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in gravelly fan alluvium. Choza soils are on moderately sloping to moderately steep dissected alluvial fan remnants. Slopes are 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 411 mm (16 in).",
