  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinati series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate. Chinati soils occur on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
