These soils formed in gravelly alluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."
