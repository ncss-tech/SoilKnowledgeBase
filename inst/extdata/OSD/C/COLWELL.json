  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the profile, except for surface layers that have been limed. Fine, rounded pebbles of quartzite occur in most pedons, but range from 0 to 15 percent throughout. Soft black masses or coatings and/or concretions of iron and manganese oxides are few to common throughout the profile. Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic by sum of cations is more than 15 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nA thin AB or BA horizon occurs in some pedons. It has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 to 6. The lower part, below a depth of 30 inches from the upper boundary of the argillic horizon, has a similar range in color as the upper part and in addition includes value of 4. The particle-size control section averages 20 to 40 percent silt and more than 20 percent sand. Texture is clay or clay loam in the upper part and clay, clay loam, or sandy clay in the lower part. Redox accumulations or depletions in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common and are assumed to be relict redoximorphic features."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anniston, Beckham, and Decatur series in the same family and the Davidson and Greenville series in a closely related family. Anniston soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and quartzite and commonly have angular fragments of sandstone in the profile. Beckham soils formed in residuum from marble and have less than 15 percent base saturation by sum of cations at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon. Decatur soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone and have less than 20 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Davidson and Greenville soils have a kandic horizon. Davidson soils formed in residuum weathered from dark-colored rocks of the Piedmont. Greenville soils have less than 20 percent silt in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colwell soils are on uplands and ancient, high terraces of the Gulf coastal plain. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent, but commonly are less than 8 percent. These soils formed in clayey marine or fluvial sediments. The average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches. The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bama, Brantley, Lucedale, Luverne, Smithdale, and Subran soils. Bama and Lucedale soils are in positions similar to those of the Colwell soil on summits of high terraces and are fine-loamy. Brantley, Luverne, and Smithdale soils are on side slopes and do not have rhodic colors in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Additionally, Brantley and Luverne soils have mixed clay mineralogy and Smithdale soils are fine-loamy."
