Depth to water table varies from 36 to 60 inches after drainage.\nColors of the A horizon have hues of 10YR, values of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1.  May have gray and greenish gray mottles in the A horizon.\nThe B horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4 and chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe C horizons are dominantly gley colors with mottles of dark gray, dark yellowish brown, olive brown, and red.  The B horizons range from medium to coarse subangular blocky structure.  These soils have sticky and plastic solum and slightly sticky and plastic C horizons.  Effervescence varies from strong to violent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Castro, Constancia, Kaloko, Magna, Salt Lake, and Sunnyvale series.  The Constancia soils are better drained and have colors of higher chromas in the A and B horizons.  The Kaloko soils have a carbonatic mineralogy.  The other soils are cooler and have greater fluctuations of soil temperatures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cintrona soils occupy concave slope positions in the level floodplains with slope gradients with less than 1 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous fine textured sediments derived from volcanic and limestone rocks.  Climate is semiarid.  The average annual rainfall averages 25 to 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 to 80 degrees F."

The Cortada and San Anton soils have loamy unmottled profiles.  The Jacaguas soils have loamy profiles, are noncalcareous and are underlain by coarse gravelly fragments at shallow depth.  The Machuelo soils have lighter colored surface horizons."
