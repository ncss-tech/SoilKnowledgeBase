  "OVERVIEW": "The Coser series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Coser soils are on hills, mountains, pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
