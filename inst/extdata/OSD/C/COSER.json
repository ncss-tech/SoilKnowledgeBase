The paralithic materials below the contact are tuff, tuffaceous siltstone, or tuffaceous shale.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: averages 40 to 60 percent.\nRock fragments: averages 5 to 20 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are tuff.\nA horizon\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nClay content: 20 to 35 percent.\nOrganic matter content:  2 or 3 percent.\nBt horizons\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Clay or gravelly clay.\nClay content:  40 to 60 percent.\nStructure:  Moderate or strong angular blocky or prismatic.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\n2Bt horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Silty clay, clay, or gravelly clay loam.\nClay content:  35 to 55 percent.\nStructure:  Weak to strong angular blocky or prismatic.\nReaction:  Neutral or moderately alkaline.\nOther features:  These horizons are residual and commonly have rock structure in 10 to 40 percent by volume of the matrix.
