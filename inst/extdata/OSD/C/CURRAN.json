  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argilic horizon and to sandy outwash ranges from 43 to 60 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 40 to 55 inches. The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 27 percent clay. Rock fragments typically are absent throughout the soil but volume of gravel ranges up to 5 percent in the 2Bt and 3C horizons. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the soil but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Redox features are throughout the soil below a depth of 10 inches and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less make up 50 percent or more of the matrix within the upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon. Saturation occurs within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nBelow the upper 5 inches of the Btg horizon, some pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Btg horizon except that chroma is 3 or more.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is stratified sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with bands or pockets of sand or fine sand.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand and is stratified in some pedons."

Atterberry, Bethalto, Canoe, Emery, Franklin, Koszta, and Millbrook soils are not sandy in the lower part of the series control section at a depth of 43 to 60 inches. Mulvey soils have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Virgil and Wauconda soils have average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in loess or other silty deposits, or both, and in a mostly loamy transition layer underlain by sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to about 35 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F."

Curran soils are associated geographically with the higher-lying, well drained Bertrand and the moderately well drained Jackson soils and the lower-lying, poorly drained Ettrick soils.  Dells soils are on similar positions in the landscape where the thickness of the silty layer is less than 40 inches.  Stronghurst soils are on adjacent areas of similar drainage where the silty deposits are sufficiently thick to accommodate the entire solum."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Curran soils are subject to occasional flooding. These soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 feet for some time in most years."
