    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crackerneck soils are on ridge tops. Slopes are convex and the gradients range from 1 to 35 percent. These soils formed in cherty and silty colluvium, hillslope sediments and residuum from cherty limestone in  Mississippian geology. The mean annual temperature varies from 55 to 59 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches."

Jollymill soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock. Aslinger soils have a fine-loamy particle size class. Noark soils have a clayey-skeletal particle size class. Clarksville soils are somewhat excessively drained and Hailey soils are excessively drained. Bendavis and Jollymill soils are on ridge tops and side slopes. Aslinger soils are on high stream terraces. Hailey soils are on shoulder slopes and side slopes. Clarksville and Noark soils are on ridge tops."
