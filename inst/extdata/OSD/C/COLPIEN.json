  "OVERVIEW": "The Colpien series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on terraces that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks. These soils are artificially drained.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
