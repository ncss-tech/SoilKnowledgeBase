  "OVERVIEW": "The Cosely series consists of very deep, excessively drained that formed in volcanic ash over alluvium, outwash, colluvium and till from mixed metasedimentary sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, outwash terraces, lateral moraines and glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,225 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
