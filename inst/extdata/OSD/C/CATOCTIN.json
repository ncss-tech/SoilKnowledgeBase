  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons, from 15 to 55 percent in the B horizon and from 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  These primarily consist of greenstone or other dark colored rock fragments.  Except where limed, the soil is strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, E, and B horizons, and moderately acid to neutral in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or lOYR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 are less than 10 inches thick.  The A horizon is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or lOYR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the B horizon or it is multicolored 1oamy material mixed with from 35 to 80 percent partially weathered rock fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Webbtown is the only other series in the same family.   Webbtown soils contain rock fragments or porous shale, silt stone, or finegrain sandstone.  Similar soils in closely related families include the Brandywine, Cardiff, Highfield, Lew, Litz, and Myersville series.  Brandywine and Cardiff soils do not have an orgillic horizon in any part of the pedon and they have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Highfield and Myersville soils have a continous argillic horizon and less than 35 percent weighted average of rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Lew soils have a continuous argillic horizon and base saturation less than 35 percent. Litz soils have less than 35 percent base saturation and rock fragments that are shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Catoctin soils are on ridges and side slopes in the Northern Piedmont plateau and Blue Ridge Mountains.  The soils nearly level to very steep with slope gradients ranging from about 0 to 80 percent.  Catoctin soils formed in material weathered from greenstone and other dark colored rocks.  The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 41 inches."
