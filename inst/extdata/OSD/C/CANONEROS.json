  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canoneros series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and slope alluvium over residuum derived from basalt. Canoneros soils are on lava plateaus and cinder cones. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
