  "STATES": "CO,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Colona series consists of well drained soils formed in thick calcareous fine textured transported material derived from silty sedimentary rocks, volcanic flow rocks, and tuffs.  Colona soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 49 degres F.  Typically Colona soils have grayish brown, very friable, granular, noncalcareous A horizons, pale brown, calcareous silty clay B2 horizons, and light olive gray, heavy silty clay Cca horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 10 inches and is not deeper than the upper 2 inches of the B2 horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section.  Gypsum content of the control section ranges from 0 to 15 percent by weight.  The control section is normally silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent silt, and 5 to 40 percent sand, with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent in most COLONA subhorizons of the control section and are mainly 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above 40 inches has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent which decreases with increasing depth."

Stutzman soils have a total extensibility of less than 2.4 inches and do not develop wide cracks when dry."

At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer in Colorado and in winter and spring in Nevada.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F."
