  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 10 inches and is not deeper than the upper 2 inches of the B2 horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section.  Gypsum content of the control section ranges from 0 to 15 percent by weight.  The control section is normally silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent silt, and 5 to 40 percent sand, with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent in most COLONA subhorizons of the control section and are mainly 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above 40 inches has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent which decreases with increasing depth."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Heldt soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than one- fourth the time soil temperature is 41 degrees F, or higher.  Stutzman soils have a total extensibility of less than 2.4 inches and do not develop wide cracks when dry."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Colona soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from about 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in thick calcareous fine textured transported materials derived from silty sedimentary rocks, volcanic flow rocks, and tuffs.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer in Colorado and in winter and spring in Nevada.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F."
