  "OVERVIEW": "The Claunch series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and gypsum rock on fan terraces, bajadas and knolls.  Slopes range from 2 to 7 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
