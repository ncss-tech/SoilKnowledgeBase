  "OVERVIEW": "The Chalkford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soil that formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
