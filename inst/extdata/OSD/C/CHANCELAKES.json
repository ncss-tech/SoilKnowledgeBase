  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chancelakes soils are on depressions and drainageways on plateaus. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff with an influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,325 to 1,550 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250  to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Oatmanflat and Silverash soils. Oatmanflat soils are ashy, average 12 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section, do not have aquic conditions, and occur on stream terraces. Swalesilver soils do not have cracks to the soil surface, have shorter periods of surface ponding, and are on slightly higher parts of depressions."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; very slow permeability; low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Episaturation is present with a perched seasonal high water table above 30 cm (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) between January and May. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from January through May with water depths up to 30 cm. Endosaturation is also present in horizons below 74 cm between March and June."
