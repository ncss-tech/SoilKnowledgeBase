  "OVERVIEW": "The Countshill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from siltstone and sandstone. Countshill soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
