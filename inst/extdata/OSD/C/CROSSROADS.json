  "OVERVIEW": "The Crossroads series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian and lacustrine deposits derived from the Tahoka and Blackwater Draw Formations of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on plains, playa slopes, and draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 15.0 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
