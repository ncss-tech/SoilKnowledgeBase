  "OVERVIEW": "The Cambert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
