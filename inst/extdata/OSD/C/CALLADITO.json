Curtis Siding soils are inactive. Dwyer, Karval, Orpha, Valent, and Wigton soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Mido soils have hues redder than 7.5YR and a higher precipitation range. Pensom soils are deep to sandstone. Tullock soils are moderately deep. Pinavetes soils have soil temperatures of 53 to 57 degrees F., 10 to 14 inches precipitation, and are effervescent in the control section."

Calladito soils form dunes on stream terraces, fan remnants, and on dipslopes and summits of cuestas and mesas. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6,300 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches. The frost free period is 100 to 145 days."
