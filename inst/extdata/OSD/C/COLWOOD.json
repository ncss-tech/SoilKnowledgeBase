The well drained Sisson, moderately well drained Tuscola, and somewhat poorly drained Kibbie soils formed in similar materials and are part of the toposequence with Colwood soils. Del Rey and Lenawee soils are associated on lake plains. Del Rey soils are somewhat poorly drained. Lenawee soils do not have a mollic epipedon."

A small part, including areas that lack adequate drainage, is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is chiefly red maple, American elm, quaking aspen, alder, and marsh grasses."
