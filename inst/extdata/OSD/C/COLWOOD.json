  "OVERVIEW": "The Colwood series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty and loamy glaciolacustrine deposits or outwash. These soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, moraines, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
