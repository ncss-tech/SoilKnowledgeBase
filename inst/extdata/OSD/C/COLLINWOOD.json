Kandiyohi and Nameoke soils have moist bulk density less than 1.6 g/cc in the lower third of the series control section. The  Ocheda soils have 40 to 60 inches of lacustrine sediment over glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Collinwood soils are on plane to convex slopes on glacial lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 18 percent. Collinwood soils formed in fine textured lacustrine sediments that are over 60 inches thick. These sediments are late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 25 to 30 inches."

In the past this soil included the concept of the Ocheda series.\nThe type location was moved as of this revision to better reflect the landscape and material representative of this series. 1/21/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 507 and 508 for results of some laboratory analyses and to Lincoln Laboratory S69Minn-7-9.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
