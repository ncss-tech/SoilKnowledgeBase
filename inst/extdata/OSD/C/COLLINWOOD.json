  "OVERVIEW": "The Collinwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey, calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. The permeability is moderately slow or slow. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

In the past this soil included the concept of the Ocheda series.\nThe type location was moved as of this revision to better reflect the landscape and material representative of this series. 1/21/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 507 and 508 for results of some laboratory analyses and to Lincoln Laboratory S69Minn-7-9.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
