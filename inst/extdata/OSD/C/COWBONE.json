  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowbone series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and rapid in the substratum.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
