Cinderspring, Coutis, Earcree, Foxvire, Gardners Fork, Moonlight, Razorba, Naz, and Taral soils are very deep.  Grayhead soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Hailman soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Skyway soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Tosp soils are very deep and deep to lithic contacts and average 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coffepot soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granite.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,980to 2,590feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
