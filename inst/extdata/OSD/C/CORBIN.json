  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from about 40 to 70 inches or more.  The A horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The Bt horizon is slightly acid or neutral, and the lower 2Bt and C horizons are neutral or mildly alkaline.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from about 40 to 70 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically silt loam and less commonly loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon average between 27 and 35 percent clay and contain less than 15 percent of fine or coarser sand.  Faint mottles are above the 2Bt horizon in some pedons but are at depths greater than 20 inches.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay or silty clay.  The top of the 2Bt horizon is within depths of 40 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay."

Pond Creek, Grant, Norge, Teller, and Westview soils lack clay or silty clay lower Bt horizons.  St. Paul soils have formed in residuum from silt beds and have redder hue.  The Bethany, Kirkland and Tabler soils are fine.  The Farnum soils are fine-loamy.  Vanoss soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick."
