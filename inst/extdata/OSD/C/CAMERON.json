  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to a contrasting loamy horizon ranges from 22 to 36 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges\nfrom 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  The upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control section is clayey with a clay range of 38 to about 60 percent, and a COLE value of 0.10 to 0.15.  The lower part of the control section is loamy with 25 to 35 percent less clay than the upper part.  The electrical conductivity is typically less than 2 millimhos but ranges up to 12 millimhos or more in some saline pedons.\nThe A horizon is gray (10YR 5/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or brown (7.5YR 5/2; 10YR 5/2).  Moist value is less than 3.5.  This horizon is silty clay loam, silty\nclay, or clay.\nThe B horizon is gray (10YR 5/1 6/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2),\nlight brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or brown (7.5YR 5/2; 10YR 5/3).\nIt is silty clay or clay.  Structure ranges from weak to moderate subangular and angular blocky.\nThe IIC horizons range from brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4), or light brown, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), to very\npale brown (10YR 7/3).  Clay content of the IIC horizons ranges\nfrom 16 to about 26 percent.  They are silt loam or loam with thin sandy or clayey strata.  Secondary carbonates range from a few to about 4 percent by volume of weakly cemented concretions and soft masses.  The calcium carbonate equivalent exceeds 15 percent in\nall horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Denton, Krum, Laredo, Miller, Raymondville, and Saneli series.  All of these have mean annual\nsoil temperature less than 72 degrees F., except the Laredo and Raymondville series.  Laredo soils have a fine-silty control\nsection.  Raymondville soils have a fine control section and\nbecome more clayey with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cameron soils occur on nearly level terraces above overflow.  Surfaces are plane to weakly concave with\ngradients mainly less than 1 percent.  The soil formed in\ncalcareous clayey and loamy alluvial sediments, somewhat\nstratified and many feet thick.  The climate is dry subhumid to semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28\ninches, the mean annual air temperature ranges from 74 degrees to\n76 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 22 to\nabout 34."

Olmito soils have a fine 10 to 40 inch control section and lack contrasting textures within 40 inches.  The soils occur on adjacent flood plains."
