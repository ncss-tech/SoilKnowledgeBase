  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The climate is one of long, dry summers and short, mild winters.  Depth to weathered rock may range from 18 to 46 inches.\nThe Cajalco soils have yellowish brown, slightly acid, moderately coarse textured A horizons.  The A horizons range from brown to dark brown to yellowish brown, with hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 3 or 4, from sandy loam to loam, and neutral to slightly acid.\nThe Cajalco soils have brown, slightly acid, medium textured Bt horizons.  The B2t horizon ranges from brown to reddish brown, with hues of 7.5YR to 5YR, and values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, from sandy loam to clay loam, and neutral to slightly acid.\nThe subsurface horizons commonly are higher in reaction than the surface, although there is no consistent trend in reaction with depth.  They developed in deeply weathered gabbro.  Small soft masses or seams of lime sometimes occur in the weathered gabbro."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Cajalco soils resemble those of the Escondido, Fallbrook, Las Posas, Soper, and Tivy series.  The Escondido soils are developed on metasedimentary rocks, and lack argillic horizons.  The Fallbrook soils are developed on deeply weathered acid igneous rocks, and have reddish brown to strong brown Bt horizons.  The Las Posas soils have red to dark reddish brown Bt horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  The Soper soils are developed in gravelly marine sediments, and have brown to reddish brown Bt horizons.  The Tivy soils have brown to dark brown Bt horizons in hues of 10YR."

The climate is one of long, dry summers and short, mild winters, with 9 to 16 inches average annual rainfall.  The average January temperature is 50 degrees F, the average July temperature 72 degrees F, and the average annual temperature 62 degrees F."

The Auld soils are fine textured throughout the solum; the Buren soils are developed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks, and have weak duripans in the lower part of the solum; the Vina soils are developed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks, have dark colored surface horizons, and lack diagnostic subsurface horizons.  The Wyman soils are also developed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks."
