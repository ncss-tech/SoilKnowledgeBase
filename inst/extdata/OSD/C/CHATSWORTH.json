    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches). The depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches). The particle-size control section typically averages between 50 and 60 percent clay and less than 10 percent sand. Gravel content throughout the series control section is less than 3 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. In pedons that have value of 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches (18 cm) thick. The A or Ap horizon commonly is silty clay, but the range includes silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, and clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay or clay, or less commonly silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Reaction commonly is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates. Some pedons have subhorizons that are slightly acid or neutral and do not contain carbonates. Some pedons contain clay films.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. It commonly is silty clay, but some pedons are clay or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges between 35 and 50 percent and sand content between 5 and 15 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates. Bulk density ranges from 1.7 to 1.9 gm/cc."

Blount, Morley, Nappanee, Ozaukee, and St. Clair soils have an argillic horizon and solum thicker than 61 cm (24 inches). Blount and Nappanee are on less sloping positions nearby. The moderately well drained Morley, Ozaukee, and St. Clair soils are on similar positions nearby. Bryce, Clarence, Swygert, and Varna soils have a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained Bryce soils are on lower lying nearly level parts. Clarence, Swygert, and the moderately well drained Varna soils are on nearby slopes at either higher or lower elevations. Frankfort soils have a darker colored surface layer and form a biosequence on nearby similar landforms."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Characteristics associated with wetness are difficult to determine in these soils because the colors in the solum are largely the same as those in the underlying materials. They are considered to be relic colors. In some pedons the cambic horizon is weakly expressed and in others, it contains clay films. Some areas of these soils may be due to minimal expression of soil forming processes, but most areas are considered to be the result of truncation of diagnostic horizons of more highly developed soils. These soils are treated as having a udic rather than an aquic moisture regime; therefore, taxonomic placement cannot be based solely on colors in the solum. These soils are classified as being moderately well drained because of the very high runoff potential and very slow permeability, not because they contain a free water table during the growing season.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 cm (2 inches) (Ap horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 5 to 56 cm (2 to 22 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
