  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chazos series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping stream terraces on river valleys on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 939.8 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
