  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout the soil profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay ranging typically from 27 to 35 percent, some horizons range to 20 percent clay. Coarse fragments average less than 15 percent and are mainly pebbles.\nThe Bt2, when present, has the same color values of the Bt1 but consists of a textural matrix of sandy clay loam or clay loam mixed with channers of sandstone from the fractured bedrock. Channers range from 60 to 85 percent and flagstones from 0 to 5 percent. Clay skins cover the surfaces of many channers."

Joebas soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon. Seedskadee soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 percent or more of the time the soil temperture is above 5 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 7,000 to 7,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, of which about half falls as snow and rain in April, May and early June. Mean annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
