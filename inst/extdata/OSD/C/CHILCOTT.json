  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Catchell, Lookout, Lovejoy, Novacan, Pigtail and Reno series. Catchell soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inchesLookout soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the solum. Lovejoy soils are slightly to moderately acid above the duripan. Novacan soils have strongly cemented duripans, greater than 10 percent rock fragments in the control section, and lack E horizons. Pigtail soils have a transitional silty clay loam A2 horizon above the abrupt textural change, a duripan with laminations of very strong or indurated plates greater than 20 inches thick, and lack E horizons. Reno soils have discontinuous silica laminae in the duripan and have less than 30 percent silt in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chilcott soils are nearly level to moderately steep on high terraces, mesas, calderas, shield volcanos and basalt plains at elevations of 2,300 to 5,300 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy or sandy and gravelly alluvium from igneous materials. The climate is cool, moist in the winter and hot, dry in the summer. Average annual precipitation is dominantly 8 to 12 inches, but ranges to 15 inches in the Boise Front (Ada County, Idaho). Average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 170 days."

Vickery soils are fine-loamy and lack an argillic horizon. Virtue soils are fine-silty. These soils are on similar landscape positions."

Crops grown include corn and small grains. The dominant natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The original concept of this series is a soil with a duripan formed at a sand and gravel discontinuity. The expansion to include phases with duripans over basalt would not be allowed under new series criteria and should be considered outside the series concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone 0 to 8 inches (E horizon)\nAbrupt texture change - at 8 inches; est. 30 % clay increase within 1 inch (upper boundary of 2Bt horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone 8 to 30 inches (2Bt and 2Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - zone 24 to 30 inches (2Btk2 horizon)\nDuripan- zone 30 to 47 inches (2Bkqm1 horizon) with laminated very strongly cemented or indurated plates\nDuripan- zone 47 to 53 inches (3Bkqm2) with continuous weakly cemented sand and gravel\nParticle-size control section - zone 8 to 28 inches\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric\nThese soils in the Boise Front geographic area in Ada County, Idaho receive 13 to 15 inches of mean annual precipitation, however, due to early runoff and extended period of evapotranspiration are still considered aridic.\nThe presence of sodium and soluable salts in some pedons needs investigation to determine what is the typical range.\nGeographic setting terms used throughout MLRA 11 to identify the setting of this soil are quite varied although all equate to the same landscape. There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash soil mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
