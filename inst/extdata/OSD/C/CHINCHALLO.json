  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinchallo series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils formed in diatomaceous earth over pumice and ash. They are in marshes and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soils are wet throughout in spring and early summer. Depth to pumice and ash ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The silty upper part of the control section has estimated bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 gm/cc and is diatomaceous earth. The ashy lower part has 10 to 25 percent phosphate retention, 0.2 to 0.4 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and less than 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample. It has 50 to 90 percent glass. It is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have a thin O horizon up to 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of and 0 or 1 moist and dry. It is mucky diatomaceous silt or diatomaceous silt. The n value is assumed to be less than 0.7. It has 0 to 5 percent field estimated clay. It has 7 to 24 percent organic matter. Base saturation is 20 to 40 percent by ammonium acetate.\nThe Eg layers have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 0 through 4 moist and dry. Chroma is less than 2 to depths over 20 inches. The n value is assumed to be less than 0.7. It has 0 to 5 percent field estimated clay. Base saturation; is 20 to 40 percent by ammonium acetate. It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe 2C or 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, neutral, 10YR, 7.5YR and 5YR, value of 4 through 8 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 8 moist, 0 through 3 dry. It is ashy coarse sand, ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy coarse sand, ashy coarse sandy loam or ashy sandy loam with 5 to 60 percent gravel-size pumice and 0 to 30 percent cobble-size pumice. Base saturation is less than 50 percent by ammonium acetate. Redoximorphic features when present consist of common fine black (2.5Y 2/1) manganese nodules and few fine strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) iron and manganese nodules."
