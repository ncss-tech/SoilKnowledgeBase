    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F. The soils are wet throughout in spring and early summer. Depth to pumice and ash ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The silty upper part of the control section has estimated bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 gm/cc and is diatomaceous earth. The ashy lower part has 10 to 25 percent phosphate retention, 0.2 to 0.4 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and less than 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample. It has 50 to 90 percent glass. It is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have a thin O horizon up to 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of and 0 or 1 moist and dry. It is mucky diatomaceous silt or diatomaceous silt. The n value is assumed to be less than 0.7. It has 0 to 5 percent field estimated clay. It has 7 to 24 percent organic matter. Base saturation is 20 to 40 percent by ammonium acetate.\nThe Eg layers have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 0 through 4 moist and dry. Chroma is less than 2 to depths over 20 inches. The n value is assumed to be less than 0.7. It has 0 to 5 percent field estimated clay. Base saturation; is 20 to 40 percent by ammonium acetate. It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe 2C or 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, neutral, 10YR, 7.5YR and 5YR, value of 4 through 8 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 8 moist, 0 through 3 dry. It is ashy coarse sand, ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy coarse sand, ashy coarse sandy loam or ashy sandy loam with 5 to 60 percent gravel-size pumice and 0 to 30 percent cobble-size pumice. Base saturation is less than 50 percent by ammonium acetate. Redoximorphic features when present consist of common fine black (2.5Y 2/1) manganese nodules and few fine strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) iron and manganese nodules."

The soils formed in recent diatomaceous sediments overlying pumice and ash from dacitic pumice flows. The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 32 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 to 26 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 to 59 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

Moyina soils lack the ashy-pumiceous layer within the lower part of the particle-size control section and have an umbric epipedon.  Kirk soils are ashy-pumiceous. Yamsey soils are comprised of organic soil material and vegetation is dominated by tules."
