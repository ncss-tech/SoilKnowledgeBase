  "OVERVIEW": "The Coxpin series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Coxpin soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Aquapeak soils are shallow and have an argillic horizon above a duripan. Buzzardsprings soils have a calcic horizon and do not have a duripan. Dalelake soils are very deep, are formed in eolian materials and have no diagnostic horizons. Perurose soils are more than 50 centimeters deep to a duripan."
