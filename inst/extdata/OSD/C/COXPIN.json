    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coxpin soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Elevations range from 290 to 780 meters (951 to 2,560 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 26 degrees C (68 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Aquapeak and Buzzardsprings soils are on similar landscape positions, Dalelake soils are on adjacent sandsheets with Perurose soils on adjacent, steeper and well developed fan remnants. Aquapeak soils are shallow and have an argillic horizon above a duripan. Buzzardsprings soils have a calcic horizon and do not have a duripan. Dalelake soils are very deep, are formed in eolian materials and have no diagnostic horizons. Perurose soils are more than 50 centimeters deep to a duripan."
