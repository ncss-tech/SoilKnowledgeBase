  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caneek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of stratified, calcareous, silty alluvium and in the underlying silty alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (about 47 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (about 32 inches).",
