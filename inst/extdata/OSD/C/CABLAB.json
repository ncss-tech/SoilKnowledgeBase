Lithology of fragments is mixed.\nA1 horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 moist.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nA2 horizon and A3 horizon (when present)\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 moist.\nOrganic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.\nAC and C horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4 moist.\nRedoximorphic features: Redox concentrations are present as common to many distinct or prominent masses of iron accumulation; redox depletions may also be present as zones of iron depletion.\nOther features: Some pedons have buried A horizons between the AC and C horizons.\n2C horizon\nTexture: Stratified extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand to very gravelly loamy sand.\nClay content: 5 to 10 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cablab soils are on stream terraces in mountain landscapes. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,045 to 2,685 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cropper and Tierney soils. Cropper soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Tierney soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and have thick mollic epipedons.  In addition, both of these soils are well drained and have frigid temperature regimes."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part over rapid permeability in the lower part, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 60 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) during May and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for very brief periods between January and September."
