  "OVERVIEW": "The Cablab series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Cablab soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
