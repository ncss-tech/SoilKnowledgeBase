  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuerda series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Cuerda soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains and have slopes of about 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

Highly variable from subhorizon to subhorizon in some pedons.\nOrganic matter - Less than 1 percent; decreases irregularly with depth\nSalinity - nonsaline to strongly saline\nSodicity - nonsodic to strongly sodic\nCalcium carbonate - Slightly to violently effervescent throughout; secondary calcium carbonate as fillings and masses in the lower part.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 6 percent.\nA Horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  3 or 4 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist\nB Horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nTexture:  Very fine sandy loam, loam; some pedons have thin strata of finer or coarser textured material\nStratification -  Weakly stratified within and between horizons; usually more finely stratified in the upper part\nReaction -  Slightly to strongly alkaline\nBuried horizons -  Buried argillic horizons occur below 40 inches in some pedons"
