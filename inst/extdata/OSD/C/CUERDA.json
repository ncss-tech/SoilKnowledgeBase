Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nRock fragments - Averages less than 3 percent; some pedons have as much as 10 percent in any one subhorizon.  Highly variable from subhorizon to subhorizon in some pedons.\nOrganic matter - Less than 1 percent; decreases irregularly with depth\nSalinity - nonsaline to strongly saline\nSodicity - nonsodic to strongly sodic\nCalcium carbonate - Slightly to violently effervescent throughout; secondary calcium carbonate as fillings and masses in the lower part.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 6 percent.\nA Horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  3 or 4 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist\nB Horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nTexture:  Very fine sandy loam, loam; some pedons have thin strata of finer or coarser textured material\nStratification -  Weakly stratified within and between horizons; usually more finely stratified in the upper part\nReaction -  Slightly to strongly alkaline\nBuried horizons -  Buried argillic horizons occur below 40 inches in some pedons"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cuerda soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Elevations range from 300 to 2000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified and mixed alluvium that includes volcanic, granitic, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 69 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."

Coolidge, Gunsight, Laveen, Pinamt and Rillito soils have a calcic horizon.  Dateland soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic matter.  Gilman soils are stratified and do not have a cambic horizon."
