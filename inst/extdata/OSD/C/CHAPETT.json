    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic or to free carbonates is 14 to 22 inches, but ranges to 28 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches in thickness.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 2 to 10 percent by volume of the profile.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days per year in 6 out 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 to 2 moist. It is typically  fine sandy loam, but includes loam and sandy loam. The clay content averages between 8 and 20 percent, with a sand content of 45 to 65 percent. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin E or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist. Clean silt and sand grains occur on over 50 percent of ped faces in the upper part.  It is typically sandy clay loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam, loam and sandy loam. The non-carbonate clay content averages between 18 and 27 percent, with a sand content of 45 to 65 percent. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk or BCk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist. It is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam.  The non-carbonate clay content averages between 10 and 18 percent, with a sand content of 45 to 65 percent. Carbonate threads and masses are common to many. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist. Typically it is fine sandy loam but included are loam and sandy loam. The non-carbonate clay content averages between 8 and 18 percent, with a sand content of 45 to 65 percent. Carbonate coatings are few to many on geo-genetic fracture faces. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
