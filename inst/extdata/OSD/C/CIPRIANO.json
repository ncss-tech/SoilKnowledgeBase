  "OVERVIEW": "The Cipriano series consists of shallow and very shallow to a hardpan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from volcanic rock.  Cipriano soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

The climate is hot arid continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches.  Mean January air temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the average July air temperature is about 91 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 74 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 250 and 350 days."
