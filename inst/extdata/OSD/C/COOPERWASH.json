  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cooperwash soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite and some limestone. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
