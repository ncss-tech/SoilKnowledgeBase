  "OVERVIEW": "The Cooperwash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite and some limestone. Cooperwash soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite and some limestone. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
