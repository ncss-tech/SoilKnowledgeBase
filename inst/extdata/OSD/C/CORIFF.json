  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to loamy glacial till ranges   from 61 cm to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches). Free carbonates are in all parts of the pedon, but the upper 25 cm (10 inches) may be leached. The mollic epipedon ranges from 30 to 56 cm (12 to 22 inches) in thickness. Coarse fragments of mixed lithology typically comprise 0 to 10 percent of the upper mantle and 2 to 8 percent of the underlying material, by volume. A thin pebble band, less than 8 cm (3 inches) thick, may contain 15 to 60 percent coarse fragments and typically occurs at the contact between the two materials. The control section averages 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has few through many mottles with chroma of 2 through 6. It is stratified with textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the upper part and loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand in the lower part. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Rocksan soils have weathered sandstone in the lower third of the series control section.  Swede Grove soils average less than 18 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section, and formed entirely in coarse-loamy till."

These soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of outwash or detaic sediment overlying loamy glacial till of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature is7 degrees C (45 to 52) degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 585 to 711 cm (23 to 28 inches)."

The well drained Amiret and Clarion soils are higher on lying positions and lack the upper stratified mantle. The poorly drained Corunna soils are more acid. Lowlein, Nicollet, and Normania soils are moderately well drained and on higher lying positions."
