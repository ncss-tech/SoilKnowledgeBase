    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Carrolls soils are on low river terraces and bottomlands, and in swale areas along the Cowlitz and Toutle Rivers at elevations of 10 to 100 feet.  Carrolls soils formed in sandy dredge materials over mudflow from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  These deposits are more than 5 feet deep.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28F) is 200 to 240 days."
