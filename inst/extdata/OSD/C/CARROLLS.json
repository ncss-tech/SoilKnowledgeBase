  "OVERVIEW": "The Carrolls series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy dredge materials over a volcanic mudflow.  Carrolls soils are in swales, on low terraces, floodplains and bottomlands.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Textures are loamy sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sand with 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments from 10 to 40 inches below the surface."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Carrolls soils formed in sandy dredge materials over mudflow from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  These deposits are more than 5 feet deep.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28F) is 200 to 240 days."
