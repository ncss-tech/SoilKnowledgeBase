  "OVERVIEW": "The Crucitas series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Crucitas soils are on flood plain steps of valley floors. Slopes are 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
