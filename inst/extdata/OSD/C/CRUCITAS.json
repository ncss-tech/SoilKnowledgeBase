  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crucitas soils are on low stream terraces of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist. Slopes are 3 to 10 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons and have calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of erosional fan remnants. Levante soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on narrow flood plains of valley floors. Resolana soils are loamy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on north-facing backslopes of erosional fan remnants."
