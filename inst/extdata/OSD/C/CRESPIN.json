  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 54 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam or clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 45 percent sand.  COLE ranges from .05 to .15 and total extensibility exceeds 2.4 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR but subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crespin soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes typically range from 2 to about 15 percent.  The soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, fine textured deposits derived principally from noncalcareous shales.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
