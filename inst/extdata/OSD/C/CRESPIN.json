  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crespin series consists of well drained soils formed in thick noncalcareous, fine textured deposits derived principally from noncalcareous shale.  Crespin soils are on gently to moderately sloping fans and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  The Crespin soils have brown very friable, granular noncalcareous A1 horizons and brown noncalcareous clay C horizons.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 54 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam or clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 45 percent sand.  COLE ranges from .05 to .15 and total extensibility exceeds 2.4 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR but subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."
