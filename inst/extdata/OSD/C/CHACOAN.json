  "OVERVIEW": "The Chacoan series consists of moderately deep to sandstone bedrock, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that developed in eolian and alluvial materials. Chacoan soils are on mesas, cuestas, hills and ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
