  "OVERVIEW": "The Cobbra series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Cobbra soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
