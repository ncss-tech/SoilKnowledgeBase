A bench phase is recognized for soils on low bedrock controlled benches in Franklin and Jefferson Counties. A mine-sinks phase is recognized for soils in areas of Perry County that have subsided due to subsurface mine wall collapse."

Wynoose soils have a moist color value of 4 or more in the surface layer and are in similar nearby positions."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to low (0.01 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow or very slow. These soils have an apparent water table within 1 foot of the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. In areas of mine sinks, Cisne soils have a perched water table as much as 1.8 meters (6 feet) above the surface to 0.3 meters (1 foot) below the surface at some time between February and July in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils are in the area of Illinois known as the \"gray prairie clay pans\". The relatively high content of sand in the Ap and Eg horizons (predominantly loess derived) is thought to be due to a combination of erosion by wind and water of the finer silts and clays which tends to concentrate the remaining sand, mixing of underlying sediments by crayfish, and from deposition of sand in runon water.\nThe loamy sediments in the lower one-half of the series control section consist of reworked material derived from the upper horizons of the Sangamon paleosol mixed with an increment of early Wisconsinan loess. The materials are sometimes referred to by the general term \"Roxana silts\" or \"gritty loess\". In some pedons they include pebbles of the Illinoisan till concentrated by erosion.\nA bench phase is recognized for soils on low bedrock controlled benches in Franklin and Jefferson Counties. A mine-sinks phase is recognized for soils in areas of Perry County that have subsided due to subsurface mine wall collapse\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 43 cm (17 inches) (Ap, Eg1, and Eg2 horizons). The upper portion meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon except for thickness; the lower portion commonly has less than 50 percent base saturation.\nalbic horizon - the zone from approximately 20 to 43 cm (8 to 17 inches) (Eg1 and Eg2 horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 43 109 cm (17 to 43 inches) (B/E, Btg1, Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons);\nabrupt textural change from the Eg2 to Btg1 horizon;\naquic conditions - chroma of 1 or 2 and redox concentrations in all horizons below the Ap;\nAquic moisture regime;\nmesic temperature regime."
