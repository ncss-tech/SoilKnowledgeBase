Depth to segregated calcium carbonate in the form of threads, films, or masses ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 66 to 72 degrees F.\nThe A and Bt1 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, and the Bt1 horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon below the Bt1 has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay contents of 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and the lower part is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe Bk horizon is firm loamy calcareous earths containing fragments of calcareous sandstone.  The calcium carbonate equivalent of the Bk horizon ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe C horizon is variable and ranges from weakly cemented calcareous sandstone to massive calcareous loamy or sandy earths."

Altus soils contain less than 28 percent clay in the particle size control section and occur in regions with mean annual temperatures of less than 66 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 22 to 28 inches.  Hackey and Uvas soils have mean annual soil temperatures from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Smithville soils have mollic epipedons more than 26 inches thick.  Texroy soils are in the typic/ustic moisture regime. Tipton soils do not have calcium carbonate segregations within 36 inches of the surface and occur in regions with mean annual temperatures of less than 64 degrees F.
