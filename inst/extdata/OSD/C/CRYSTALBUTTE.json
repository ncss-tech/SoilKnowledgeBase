Bachus, Benteen, Cambern, Echemoore, Gordo, Harmehl, Senchert, Squawval, Stubbs, Vadnais, and Winu soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at a depth shallower than 40 inches.  Clayburn soils have less than 20 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.  Davtone and Gordo soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt and C horizons and lack skeletal materials in the C horizon.  Decross and Millerlake soils have a layer of CaCO3 accumulation.  Dehana and Demast soils have a mollic epipedon that is greater than 30 inches thick.  Demast soils also are medium to slightly acid.    Dranyon soils have an O horizon and are 4 to 10 inches to the top of the araillic horizon.  Hagenbarth and Southmount soils have less than 25 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Thulepah soils have an argillic horizon at a depth of 3 to 12 inches and the argillic horizon extends to a depth of 60 or more inches and they have average annual soil temperature warmer than 41 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crystalbutte soils are on basalt plains at elevations of 6,240 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in valley side alluvium derived from loess and basalt cinders and cobbles.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  Most of this precipitation  comes in the winter and spring months.  The average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."

Pinebutte soils are deep and have a layer of calcium carbonate in the substratum and are on nearly level to rolling basalt flows.  Vadnais soils are on nearly level to rolling basalt plains."
