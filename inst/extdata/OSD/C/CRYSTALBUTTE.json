  "OVERVIEW": "The Crystalbutte series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in valley side alluvium derived from loess, and basalt cinders and cobbles.  Crystalbutte soils are on basalt plains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.",

Clayburn soils have less than 20 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.  Davtone and Gordo soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt and C horizons and lack skeletal materials in the C horizon.  Decross and Millerlake soils have a layer of CaCO3 accumulation.  Dehana and Demast soils have a mollic epipedon that is greater than 30 inches thick.  Demast soils also are medium to slightly acid.    Dranyon soils have an O horizon and are 4 to 10 inches to the top of the araillic horizon.  Hagenbarth and Southmount soils have less than 25 percent coarse fragments in the control section.
