  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinkmin series consists of moderately deep to cemented glacial till, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial till, volcanic ash, and pumice overlying dense glacial till.  Chinkmin soils are in cirques, valleys, on lateral moraines and drift plains in mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

These soils formed in colluvium from glacial till, volcanic ash, and pumice overlying cemented glacial till.  Source rock is predominantly andesite, granodiorite, metasediments, and metavolcanics. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is marine influenced with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 140 inches.  A considerable portion of the precipitation is in the form of snow.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 50 to 100 days."
