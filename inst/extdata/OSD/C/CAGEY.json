Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 18 to 30 inches from November to April.  Reaction is slightly  acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It lacks mottles in some pedons.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry, and is  mottled.  It is fine sand or sand."

Indianola soils lack a water table and mottles and are somewhat excessively drained.  McKenna soils are loamy-skeletal, have an aquic moisture regime and are moderately deep."
