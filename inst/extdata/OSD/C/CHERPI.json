  "OVERVIEW": "The Cherpi series consists of very deep, well drained soils occurring on sideslopes of foothills, mountains, and cinder cones. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from loess, rhyolitic tuff, and cinders. Slopes are 6 to 60 percent. Cherpi soils have moderately rapid permeability. Average annual precipitation is about 22 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
