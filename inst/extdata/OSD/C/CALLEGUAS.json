  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of shale and sandstone is 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches). The mean annual soil temperature is about 16 to 18 degrees C (60 to 65 degrees F). and the soil temperature usually is not below 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). at any time. The soil below a depth of about 13 centimeters (5 inches) is usually dry all of the time from May 1 until December 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Rock fragments are mainly angular and subangular pieces of shale 0.6 to 1 centimeters (0.25 to 0.5 inches) in diameter. Most fragments can be crushed by earthmoving machinery. Rock fragment average 5 to 35 percent of the soil volume and are usually most numerous just above the paralithic contact.  Distinct horizon differentiation is lacking.\nThe soil is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5YR 6/2. Moist value is 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, and 2.5 4/2. It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, channery loam, channery clay loam, or channery silty clay loam. The soil is slightly to violently effervescent throughout except in some pedons deeper than 25 centimeters (10 inches) the upper few inches are noneffervescent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone, shale, and mudstone. The climate is dry subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 254 to 508 millimeters (10 to 20 inches). Average January temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F); average July temperature is 19 to 23 degrees C (67 to 73 degrees F); mean annual temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C (58 to 62 degrees F). The frost-free season is 175 to 330 days."

Arnold soils are sandy and lack a paralithic contact within 100 centimeters (40 inches) of the surface.  Balcom and Castaic soils have a cambic horizon.  Fontana and Linne soils have a mollic epipedon.  Saugus soils are deep and Arnold soils have sandy textures throughout"
