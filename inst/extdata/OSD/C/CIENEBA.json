  "OVERVIEW": "The Cieneba series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  Cieneba soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation is 305 to 890 mm (12 to 35 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 14 to 18 degrees C (57 degrees to 65 degrees F).; average January temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C (45 degrees to 50 degrees F).; average July temperature is 20 to 27 degrees C (68 degrees to 80 degrees F).
