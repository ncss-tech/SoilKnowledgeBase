  "OVERVIEW": "The Conical series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to weathered schist bedrock.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slope wash materials derived from chlorite schist and amphibolite.  Conical soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 10 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

The Angostura, Cadotte, Cundiyo, Duchesne, Frisco, Gambler, Granile, Helmville, Hollandlake Larand, Leadville, MacFarlane, Needleton, Presa, Redondo, Tenrag, Tigeron, Tolvar, and Worock soils are deep or very deep.  Guffey soils are similar but formed in grus, lack the mica derived from schist, contain from 50 to 70 percent coarse and medium granitic sand and occur in areas of 430 mm of precipitation.  Tamarron soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and shale."
