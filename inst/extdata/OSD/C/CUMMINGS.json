  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cummings soils are on lake terraces and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent, but slopes less than 1 percent are most typical. They formed in lacustrine sediments that were derived primarily from volcanic ash and tuff with admixtures from andesite and basalt. Elevations range from 5,000 to 5,500 feet. The climate is cold, continental with mean annual precipitation of about 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 70 to 100 days."

Jesayno soils have ochric epipedons and are well drained. Nevadash soils are well drained. Weimer soils have clay control sections that contain slickensides."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. These soils were developed under very poorly drained conditions but the drainage has been improved by providing an outlet for Cow Head Lake and a protective dike to divert runoff waters. The water table is normally about 12 inches below the soil surface during the spring months and drops during the summer months. Surface runoff is negligible or very low during years of normal or heavy runoff when the water may stand on the soil surface for as long as 4 to 6 months. Seasonal flooding occurs on some phases of this soil. Drainage ditches and pumping has reduced the ponding and lowered the water table. Permeability is moderately slow."
