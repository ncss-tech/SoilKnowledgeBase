  "OVERVIEW": "The Cummings series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments that were derived primarily from volcanic ash and tuffs with admixtures from andesite and basalt. Cummings soils are on floodplains and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The climate is cold, continental with mean annual precipitation of about 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 70 to 100 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. These soils were developed under very poorly drained conditions but the drainage has been improved by providing an outlet for Cow Head Lake and a protective dike to divert runoff waters. The water table is normally about 12 inches below the soil surface during the spring months and drops during the summer months. Surface runoff is negligible or very low during years of normal or heavy runoff when the water may stand on the soil surface for as long as 4 to 6 months. Seasonal flooding occurs on some phases of this soil. Drainage ditches and pumping has reduced the ponding and lowered the water table. Permeability is moderately slow."
