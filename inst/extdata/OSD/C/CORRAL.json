  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Corral soils are on rock pediments and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions on rock pediments or summit, backslope, and footslope positions on plateaus.  These soils formed in pedisediment or in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffaceous sandstone, tuff, or diatomite.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm with a mean annual snowfall of 250 to 750 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 130 days."
