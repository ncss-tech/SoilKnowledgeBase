    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but irregular tongues of the Bt horizon extend to 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Flakes of mica range from few to common in the upper part of the solum and from few to many in the lower part.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, 5, or 6 and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  It is stony sandy loam or stony fine sandy loam or their bouldery analogues.  Coarse fragments including stones and boulders range from 15 to 25 percent by volume with 30 to 60 percent of the rock fragments 10 to 48 inches long.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4, 6, or 8.  The fine earth fraction of the Bt1 horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam; the Bt2 horizon is clay or clay loam and the Bt3 horizon is clay, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Coarse fragments including gravels, stones, and boulders range from 15 to 35 percent by volume with about 30 to 60 percent of the rock fragments 10 to 48 inches long.\nThe C horizon is granite and gneiss saprolite.  Colors are reddish, brownish, yellowish and grayish depending on the degree of weathering and kind of rock.  Crushed, it is sandy loam, loam, or coarse sandy loam."

All of the competing series lack a significant amount of stones throughout the solum.  In addition, Appling, Cecil, Georgeville, Herndon, and Mayodan soils have sola more than 40 inches thick.  Aragon soils contain chert fragments but do not have mica flakes.  Cataula soils have a B horizon with brittle properties.  Evard, Hayesville, and Saluda have annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Hulett and Madison soils contain more mica.  Kolomoki soils occur on coastal plain terraces and Nankin soils occur on coastal plain uplands.  Nectar soils have sola more than 40 inches over sandstone.  Spotsylvania soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Tallapoosa soils have sola less than 20 inches thick.  Vance soils have mixed mineralogy.  Wedowee soils generally have browner Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chestatee soils are sloping to steep and occur on sloping areas of the Piedmont.  Slopes are commonly 15 to 25 percent but range from 10 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in loamy materials weathered from granites, gneisses, schists, and quartzite.  Average annual temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F., average annual precipitation is about 48 to 55 inches."
