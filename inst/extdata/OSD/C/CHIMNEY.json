  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chimney soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on north-facing backslope and toeslope positions.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
