  "OVERVIEW": "The Chimney series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Chimney soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
