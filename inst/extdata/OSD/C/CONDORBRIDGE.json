    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 12 to 60 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A, BA, Bw1, and part of the Bw2 horizons)\nAndic subgroup feature - from a depth of 0 to 12 inches (Ap and A horizons) with the zone from 0 to 5 inches qualifying for andic soil properties (assumed).\nA proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
