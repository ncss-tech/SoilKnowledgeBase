  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 26 to 50 inches.  Thickness of the loamy mantle, depth to the base of the cambic horizon,  and depth to stratified sandy outwash ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The coarse-loamy mantle contains more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  Volume of rock fragments is less than 35 percent as a weighted average in the particle-size control section.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology, but mostly of igneous origin. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 15 to 45 percent in the sandy outwash as a weighted average, but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Some of the gravel in the sandy outwash is more than 0.5 cm in diameter and 15 percent (25 percent by weight) or more is retained on the #4 sieve as a weighted average.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. Bw horizons with spodic colors have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon or do not meet the acid oxalate extract criteria.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 6.  It is stratified sandy outwash. Strata are dominantly gravelly or very gravelly analogs of sand or coarse sand, but strata of sand, or coarse sand are in most pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in 10 to 24 inches of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy outwash of Late Wisconsinan Age.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."
