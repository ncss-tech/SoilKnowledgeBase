  "OVERVIEW": "The Calcree series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  Calcree soils are on stream bottoms and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
