  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Accumulations of salt or gypsum typically are below 16 inches. SAR and ESP range from 13 to 30.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam or very fine sandy loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have an A horizon.\nThe Btn1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam and is neutral to moderately alkaline. It has light gray coatings or a silt loam cap less than 1 inch thick on top of columns in some pedons.\nThe Btn2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is clay or silty clay and is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk and Btkn horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. They are clay, silty clay or silty clay loam. They have few to many fine or very fine accumulations of carbonates. They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have C horizons which have color and texture of the Bk horizons.\nThe 2C horizon when present occurs below a depth of 40 inches. It is multicolored shale and/or gravelly sand. It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Soils formed in clayey sediments or clayey residuum. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from about 12 to 18 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Hisle soils and the Larvie, Metre, and Orella soils. Hisle soils are on similar positions as the Cedar Butte soils. Larvie and Metre soils do not have a natric horizon and are underlain by shale between depths of 20 and 40 inches. They are on slightly higher slopes. Orella soils have steeper slopes, are shallow to shale, and have high sodium content."
