  "OVERVIEW": "The Cassenai series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from granodiorite. The Cassenai soils are on sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
