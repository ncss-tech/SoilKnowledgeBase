About 25 to 40 percent of the horizon is stone; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual boundary.  4 to 15 inches thick.\nBt--14 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very stony clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm; about 55 percent of the horizon is stone; there are thin continuous clay films on peds and coating the stone fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear boundary.  12 to 37 inches thick.\nR--28 to 30 inches; limestone bedrock weakly fractured with streamers of Bt horizon extending into the rock."
