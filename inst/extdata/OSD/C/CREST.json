  "OVERVIEW": "The Crest series consists of well drained, light colored, gravelly, fine textured, neutral to slightly alkaline soils developing on steep mountain slopes in stony, moderately fine to fine textured, neutral to slightly alkaline residuum from limestone.  At their type location the average annual precipitation is 27 inches, average annual temperature is 40 degrees, and an average summer temperature is 65 degrees.",
