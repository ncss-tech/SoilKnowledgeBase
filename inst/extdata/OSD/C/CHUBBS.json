  "OVERVIEW": "The Chubbs series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Chubbs soils are on crests and side slopes of hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
