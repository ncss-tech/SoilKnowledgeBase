    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically carbonates are at the surface, but in some pedons the surface layer is leached.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. The particle size control section contains 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  It dominantly is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It typically has common or many accumulations of carbonate, but is disseminated in some pedons.  Some pedons do not have an ABk horizon.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 5 (5 to 7 dry); and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate is commonly disseminated throughout the Bk horizon but accumulations may be visible.  It contains 15 to more than 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons the C horizon extends to a depth greater than 60 inches.  Mottles range from few to many.  Some pedons do not have mottles in the upper part of the C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 6 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Mottles range from few to many.  It has about 1 to 5 percent gravel by volume.  In some pedons the 2C horizon is not present."

Bearden soils are laminated within a depth of 40 inches or varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cubden soils are on low rises and rims slightly above depressions on uplands.  Slope gradients are 0 to 6 percent and are plane to slightly convex.  The soils formed in silty glacial till, or in silty materials over loamy glacial till on uplands.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 48 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2900."

Brookings soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and are in slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Colvin soils do not have chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches and are on slightly lower positions on the landscape.  Kranzburg soils have a cambic horizon, do not have a calcic horizon, and are on convex slopes above the Cubden soils.   McIntosh soils are on similar positions on the landscape.  Badger soils are in lower swale positions and have an argillic horizon.  The very poorly or poorly drained Oldham, Parnell, and Tonka soils have a fine textured series control section and are in depressions.  The well drained Poinsett soils do not have mottles above 30 inches, have a cambic horizon, and are on plane slopes above the Cubden soils.  Waubay soils do not have calcic horizons within 16 inches, have a cambic horizon, and are in similar or slightly higher positions on the landscape."
