  "OVERVIEW": "The Cubden series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty glacial till, or in silty material over loamy glacial till. These soils are on low rises and rims slightly above depressions on uplands.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. The particle size control section contains 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  It dominantly is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It typically has common or many accumulations of carbonate, but is disseminated in some pedons.  Some pedons do not have an ABk horizon.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 5 (5 to 7 dry); and chroma of 1 to 4.

It contains 15 to more than 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons the C horizon extends to a depth greater than 60 inches.  Mottles range from few to many.  Some pedons do not have mottles in the upper part of the C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 6 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Mottles range from few to many.  It has about 1 to 5 percent gravel by volume.  In some pedons the 2C horizon is not present."

Colvin soils do not have chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches and are on slightly lower positions on the landscape.  Kranzburg soils have a cambic horizon, do not have a calcic horizon, and are on convex slopes above the Cubden soils.   McIntosh soils are on similar positions on the landscape.  Badger soils are in lower swale positions and have an argillic horizon.  The very poorly or poorly drained Oldham, Parnell, and Tonka soils have a fine textured series control section and are in depressions.  The well drained Poinsett soils do not have mottles above 30 inches, have a cambic horizon, and are on plane slopes above the Cubden soils.  Waubay soils do not have calcic horizons within 16 inches, have a cambic horizon, and are in similar or slightly higher positions on the landscape."
