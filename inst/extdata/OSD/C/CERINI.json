It is usually dry from March or April to December or January. The soil is low in organic matter and is less than 1 percent. The organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is calcareous throughout with 1 to 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Gypsum crystals are present in some pedons. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 18 to 34 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/3, 6/2 or 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously mapped as Panoche series in the soil survey of Mendota Area, California, Series 1940, No. 18 and Coalinga Area, California, Series 1944, No. 1. The classification of Cerini Series was proposed as Typic Torrifluvents. This was changed to Fluventic Haplocambids when a cambic horizon was recognized in the Cerini profile. The presence of a cambic horizon is based on the following characteristic:\n1. Soil structure in the cambic horizon (unless moist from irrigation or rainfall or drastically modified by deep ripping).\n2. Removal of carbonates from the cambic horizon.\n3. Accumulation of carbonates below the cambic horizon which supports loss of carbonates from overlying horizons.\n4. Higher chroma in the cambic horizon in some pedons.\n5. Most areas of Cerini soil are irrigated with 2 to 3 feet of water per year applied for crop production. Previous to irrigation, only about 7 inches of precipitation coupled with flood water, was available for soil development. Movement of carbonates, fertilizers, and salt through the soil profile has created more pronounced cambic horizons because of application of irrigation water.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1.  Ochric Epipedon--0 to 5 inches (Ap).\n2.  Cambic Horizon--5 to 25 inches (Bw).\n2.1 Removal of carbonates from the cambic horizon.\n3.  Zone of redistribution--25 to 62 inches (Bk)."
