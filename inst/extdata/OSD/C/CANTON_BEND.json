  "OVERVIEW": "The Canton Bend series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on level to gently undulating low stream terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A). They formed in stratified marine or stream sediments. Near the type location the average annual temperature is about     degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about    inches. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 40 to more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile, except where the surface has been limed. Depth to rock is more than 8 feet.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, usually mottled with shades of brown, yellow, and red.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has similar colors and mottles but also includes strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8) matrix color.\nThe B2t horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the B2t horizon ranges from 35 to 45 percent, and averages about 37 percent.  Silt content ranges from 30 to 55 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, usually mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and red or is mottled in shades of red, brown, and yellow. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has the same range of colors as the BC horizon. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is commonly stratified in these textures. Gravelly strata may occur in some pedons."

The mean annual temperature of 65 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 53 inches near the type location."

Annemaine and Lenoir soils are on lower positions.  In addition, Annemaine soils are moderately well drained and the somewhat poorly drained Lenoir soils have yellower and thicker subsoils. Wickham soils are on higher positions and have fine-loamy control sections."
