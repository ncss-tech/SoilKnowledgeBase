The well drained Owosso soils and the somewhat poorly drained Metamora soils form a closely associated drainage sequence with Corunna soils. Corunna soils are associated with the poorly drained or very poorly drained, stratified Lenawee and Toledo soils on lake plains. Brookston and Barry soils are wet associates in the moraines, and the moderately well drained Miami and well drained Metea soils commonly are on the ridgetops and slopes in some morainic areas."
