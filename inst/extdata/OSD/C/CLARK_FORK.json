  "OVERVIEW": "The Clark Fork series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in very gravelly and cobbly alluvium derived mainly from granite.  These soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches (635 mm), and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F (6.5 deg. C).",
