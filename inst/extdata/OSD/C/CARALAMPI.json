  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caralampi series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan and slope alluvium from granitic and volcanic rock.  Caralampi soils are on fan terraces and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
