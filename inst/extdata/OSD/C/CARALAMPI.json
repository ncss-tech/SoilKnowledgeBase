  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in fan and slope alluvium derived from granite, rhyolite, andesite, dacite, and related tuff, and agglomerates.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 68 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 180 to 260 days."
