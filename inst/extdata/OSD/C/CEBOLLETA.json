  "OVERVIEW": "The Cebolleta series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in windblown sediments and alluvium over basalt.  Cebolleta soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
