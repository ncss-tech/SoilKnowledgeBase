  "OVERVIEW": "The Cades series consists of very deep, well drained soils on old stream terraces and alluvial fans in the lower coves in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). They formed in alluvium derived from materals weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phylite and metasandstone. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent.",

They range from channers to flagstones with size increasing with depth.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.

Allegheny soils are on lower stream terraces and do not have a discontinuity.  Allenwood soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale and contain fragments of those rocks. Chetwynd soils formed in loamy outwash sediments and underlying sandy outwash capped by loess. Drapermill, Gilpin, and Gilwood soils formed in residuum and have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Frankstown, Leck Kill, Rhodhiss, Ungers, and Whiteford soils formed in residuum and do not have a discontinuity. Glenelg soils formed in residuum weathered from micaceous schist and contain fragments of those rocks. Lonon soils are on higher colluvial remnants, have redder Bt horizons, and lack a discontinuity. Murrill soils formed in colluvium from acid sandstone and shales and contain fragments of those rocks. Queponco soils formed in loamy fluvial and eolian deposits underlain by sandy and loamy fluvial and marine (fluviomarine) deposits at 15 to 40 inches. Reybold soils formed in silty eolian deposits underlain by sandy and loamy fluviomarine sediments at 12 to 30 inches. Tate soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from high grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks."
