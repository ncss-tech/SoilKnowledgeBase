Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent above the lithologic discontinuity and 35 to greater than 80 percent below the discontinuity. The depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 24 to 48 inches. Average rock fragment content in the particle-size control section is less than 35 percent. They range from channers to flagstones with size increasing with depth.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8. Texture is loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 to 8. Texture is loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has colors similar to the BC.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay loam."

Allegheny soils are on lower stream terraces and do not have a discontinuity.  Allenwood soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale and contain fragments of those rocks. Chetwynd soils formed in loamy outwash sediments and underlying sandy outwash capped by loess. Drapermill, Gilpin, and Gilwood soils formed in residuum and have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Frankstown, Leck Kill, Rhodhiss, Ungers, and Whiteford soils formed in residuum and do not have a discontinuity. Glenelg soils formed in residuum weathered from micaceous schist and contain fragments of those rocks. Lonon soils are on higher colluvial remnants, have redder Bt horizons, and lack a discontinuity. Murrill soils formed in colluvium from acid sandstone and shales and contain fragments of those rocks. Queponco soils formed in loamy fluvial and eolian deposits underlain by sandy and loamy fluvial and marine (fluviomarine) deposits at 15 to 40 inches. Reybold soils formed in silty eolian deposits underlain by sandy and loamy fluviomarine sediments at 12 to 30 inches. Tate soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from high grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks."

Elevation ranges from 1400 to 3000 feet. Cades soils are formed from alluvium weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite and metasandstone. Mean annual temperature 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 67 inches near the type location"

Dellwood, and Smokemont soils are on adjacent floodplains and are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Junaluska, Soco, Stecoah, and Tsali soils are on adjacent residual side slopes. Junaluska and Soco soils have paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Stecoah soils have paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Tsali soils have paralithic contact at less than 20 inches."
