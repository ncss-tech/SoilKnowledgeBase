    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cox soils are on basalt plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,300 to 5,000 feet.  The soil formed in aeolian material reworked by water over basalt bedrock.  The climate is semi-arid with annual precipitation of 10 to 13 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 125 days."
