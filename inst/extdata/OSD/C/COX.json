  "OVERVIEW": "The Cox series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in aeolian material reworked by water.  Cox soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
