  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick over dense clay or claystone bedrock.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 to 4. The E horizon is 1 to 3 units higher in value than the A horizon. However, the A and E horizons usually have been mixed by cultivation. The texture is fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam. Stony phases are also recognized.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Fragments of sandstone, chert, and ironstone from 1 to 60 cm across comprise 0 to 20 percent by volume and cover 0 to 10 percent of the soil surface.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 4 to 8. Most pedons have mottled horizons in these colors and in shades of gray or grayish brown. Texture is sandy clay or clay, with clay content ranging from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Fragments of sandstone, chert, and ironstone range from 0 to 3 percent by volume.\nThe BC horizons are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray. Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay. Some pedons have stratified layers of fine sandy loam, clay loam, or clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cd or C layers is in shades of red, brown, or gray. Texture is claystone bedrock, dense clay, or claystone bedrock that is stratified with sandstone bedrock or  loamy soil material. The texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay. Some pedons have weakly cemented layers of sandstone. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline and calcareous. Some pedons contain a few films, threads, or soft masses of calcium carbonate."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Chazos, Shiro  Straber, Axtell, Crosstell, Demona, Pedernales, Selden, Tabor, and Windthorst series in similar families. Chazos soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods. Shiro soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Straber soils lack red argillic horizons and have formed in citronelle geology. Axtell, Crosstell, and Tabor soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Demona soils have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick. Pedernales and Windthorst soils lack grayish mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Selden soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon and have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chaney soils occupy gently sloping to sloping plains with mixed concave and convex surfaces. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent but are dominantly from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed mainly in the basal sands and sandy clays of Cretaceous age and occupy a fringe or transition area between soils formed from Cretaceous age materials and those formed from Pennsylvanian age materials. Pennsylvanian sandstone and claystones are frequently encountered below 30 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches. Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges form 600 to 1,750. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 38 to 64."

Demona, Pedernales, and Windthorst soils are in positions similar to Chaney soils. Cisco, Duffau, Nimrod, and Seldon soils have fine loamy control sections, in addition, Nimrod soils have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick. Cisco and Duffau soils are below Chaney soils in concave positions. Nimrod soils are above on narrow stream divides or knolls. Selden soils occupy positions similar to Chaney soils. Hassee soils have thin albic horizons over grayish clayey argillic horizons and are below Chaney soils in low, slightly depressed positions. Patilo soils have sandy epipedons 40 to 72 inches thick and are above Chaney soils on narrow stream divides or knolls."
