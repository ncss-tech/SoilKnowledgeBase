  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Columbus Eunola, Mazarn, Mollicy, Whitwell and Yauhannah series in the same family and the Chatom and Slagle series in a related family. Columbus soils are on slightly lower terrace positions and are subject to flooding. Eunola and Yauhannah soils have less than 25 percent silt in control section. The somewhat poorly drained Mazarn soils are in small upland drains and intermittent streams in the Ouachita mountains of Arkansas. The somewhat poorly drained Mollicy soils are on lower positions and are subject to flooding. Whitwell soils are in the Southern Appalachian Valley and Highland Rim and have up to 15 percent cobblestones and commonly have stratified C horizons. Chatom soils are on upland positions. Slagle soils are on uplands of eastern Virginia."
