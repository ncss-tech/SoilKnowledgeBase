  "OVERVIEW": "The Cochran series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Cochran soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
