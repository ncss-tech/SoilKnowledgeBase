    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer within MLRA 2 but ranges to 90 days in MLRA 5. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and has base saturation of 50 to 75 percent. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The particle-size control section is 20 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is loam in the upper part and loam or clay loam in the lower part.  It has 18 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon and BC horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam. It has 3 to 20 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent gravel. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  This horizon may be absent in some pedons."

Eld soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in some parts of the solum, and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the summer. Nook soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days during the summer. McDoug soils have iron depletions within 40 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chapman soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains at elevations of 100 to 1,600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in mixed loamy alluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The summers are hot and dry and winters are warm and wet. The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but ranges to 70 inches in some areas. The average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Chehalis and Cloquato soils are on slightly lower flood plains. Malabon soils are fine. Salem soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Malabon and Salem soils are on higher stream terraces. McBee soils are moderately well drained and fine-silty. Wapato soil are poorly drained. Wapato soils are in depressions on flood plains. Newberg soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on lower flood plains."
