  "OVERVIEW": "The Cotharin series consists of very shallow or shallow to fractured bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from meta-volcanic rock. Cotharin soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
