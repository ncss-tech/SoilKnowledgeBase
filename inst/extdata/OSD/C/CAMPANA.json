  "OVERVIEW": "The Campana series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that have formed in alluvium derived from limestone, gypsum rock and other sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and siltstone.  Campana soils are on alluvial fan toes, alluvial flats, and in swales on bajadas.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
