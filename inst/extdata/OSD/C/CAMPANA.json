  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Campana soils are on alluvial fan toes, alluvial flats, and on the distal portions and slightly lower, more concave areas of bajadas.  Campana soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, gypsum rock, sandstone and siltstone.  The Permian Yeso and San Andres formations are the source of these rock types where Campana occurs.  The soil surface has been reworked by winds and is eolian in origin.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,350 to 5,810 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches and the average annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."

Yesum soils lack calcic horizons and have gypsic mineralogy."
