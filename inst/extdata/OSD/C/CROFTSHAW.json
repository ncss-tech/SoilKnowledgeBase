Coldsprings soils have a Bt horizon with a hue of 5YR or redder.  Croydon soils have an E horizon and mean annual soil temperature greater than 39 degrees F.  Gebson and Kittredge soils have more than 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Hourglass soils are dry during the late summer and average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Lyonman, Swede and Youga soils are dry more than 45 consecutive days in the summer.
