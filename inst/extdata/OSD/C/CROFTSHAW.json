  "REVDATE": "02/1999",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Croftshaw series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in colluvium from metamorphic rocks.  Croftshaw soils are on mountain sideslopes, rolling hills and valley sides.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
