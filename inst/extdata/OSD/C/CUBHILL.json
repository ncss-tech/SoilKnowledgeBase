These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 15 to 25 inches thick.  The upper 12 to 18 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 20 to 34 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has values of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2AB horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam or gravelly loam.  It has 20 to 30 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  It has 30 to 40 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral."

Lainand soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact.  McDaniel soils are dry for 75 to 95 consecutive days.  Setill soils are dry for 70 to 90 days.  Skooker soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact and are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes range from 15 to 35 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,900 to 4,500 feet.  Climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 24 to 28 degrees F.  The average July temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 52 F. and the frost free season ranges from 110 to 140 days."
