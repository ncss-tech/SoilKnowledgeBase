  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crowflats soils are in basin floors that receive run-on water from adjacent landscapes. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 3,500 to 4,500 feet. These soils formed in calcareous mixed alluvium. The climate is semiarid continental.  Annual precipitation is estimated to be 8 to 10 inches with over 1/2 of the total falling in June through September. The mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 220 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 4 inches (A1 horizon)\nEntisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nFluvial feature - Irregular decrease in organic carbon in the zone from 4 to 60 inches (C horizon)\nCharacterization data from Sample S74NM 35-6(1 to 12) support the classification. Field experience suggests that most Crowflats soils are fine-silty and behave like fine-silty soils.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the pedon description of this series. A field study of the type location is recommended to update the description.\nUpdated competing series section 4/10/2008, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
