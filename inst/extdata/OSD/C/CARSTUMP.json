  "OVERVIEW": "The Carstump series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks, chert and shale with minor additions of loess and ash.  Carstump soils are on summits, and side slopes of mountains, hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
