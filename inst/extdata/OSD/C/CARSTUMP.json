    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carstump soils are on summits and side slopes of mountains, hills and plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks, chert and shale with minor additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,140 meters.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
