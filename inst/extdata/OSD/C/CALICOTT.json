  "OVERVIEW": "The Calicott series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on foot slopes that formed predominantly in residuum and colluvium from granite and gneiss with surface accumulations of colluvial material derived from sandstone.  Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soils are noncalcareous throughout.  The particle-size control section is extremely gravelly sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.  The moisture control section is driestin May and June and is moist in some part from August through October.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, with chroma of 3 to 4.  Texture is very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 to 5 moist, with chroma of 3 through 6.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 50 percent.

Mathis soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches and have hues redder than 7.5YR.  Schamber soils do not have angular granite, and the gravel content is less than 50 percent by volume in all parts of the series control section.  Tsetaa soils are drier in the moisture control section and have rock fragment content in the particle-size control section that is mainly flagstones and channers derived from sandstone.
