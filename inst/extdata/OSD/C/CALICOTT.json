Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range 55 to 80 percent by volume.  They are dominantly gravel size, and the gravel is predominantly fine angular granite.  The soils are noncalcareous throughout.  The particle-size control section is extremely gravelly sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.  The moisture control section is driestin May and June and is moist in some part from August through October.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, with chroma of 3 to 4.  Texture is very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 to 5 moist, with chroma of 3 through 6.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 50 percent.  Texture is very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Clay ranges 16 to 25 percent.

Mathis soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches and have hues redder than 7.5YR.  Schamber soils do not have angular granite, and the gravel content is less than 50 percent by volume in all parts of the series control section.  Tsetaa soils are drier in the moisture control section and have rock fragment content in the particle-size control section that is mainly flagstones and channers derived from sandstone.  Walkover soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 55 to 59 degrees F."

The soils formed predominantly from residuum and colluvium from granite and gneiss with surface accumulations of colluvial material derived from sandstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,000 feet, and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
