    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 53 degrees to 58 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures is less than 9 F. The soil moisture control section is usually moist in all parts from mid-November to June. It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days. The soil is slightly acid or neutral and commonly becomes less acid with increasing depth. Organic matter is more than 1 percent to a depth of 20 inches or more. Base saturation is more than 50 percent throughout the profile and increases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3, and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe Bt horizon has variegated dry color of 10YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/8 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4. It is clay or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay. The upper boundary of the Bt horizon is abrupt with less than 15 percent absolute clay increase from the A horizon."
