  "OVERVIEW": "The Cronkhite series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. Cronkhite soils are on hills and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures is less than 9 F. The soil moisture control section is usually moist in all parts from mid-November to June. It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days. The soil is slightly acid or neutral and commonly becomes less acid with increasing depth. Organic matter is more than 1 percent to a depth of 20 inches or more. Base saturation is more than 50 percent throughout the profile and increases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3, and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe Bt horizon has variegated dry color of 10YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/8 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4. It is clay or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay. The upper boundary of the Bt horizon is abrupt with less than 15 percent absolute clay increase from the A horizon."
