Workers involved in recent Soil Survey updates believe this soil is derived from residuum.  Future MLRA update work on this series will include addressing Coshocton where historically mapped in colluvial landform positions.\nThe 06/2000 revison included numerous changes made to all parts of OSD.  Pedon description was updated to current redoximorphic feature terminology.\nPrevious revisions: 03/89-DRM; 06/2000-DRM,LER; 02/2005-DHK"
