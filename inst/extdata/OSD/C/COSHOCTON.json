    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 69 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nRedox depletions with chroma 2 or less--the zone from 36 to 147 cm\nThis revision eliminates colluvium as a parent material for the Coshocton series.  Workers involved in recent Soil Survey updates believe this soil is derived from residuum.  Future MLRA update work on this series will include addressing Coshocton where historically mapped in colluvial landform positions.\nThe 06/2000 revison included numerous changes made to all parts of OSD.  Pedon description was updated to current redoximorphic feature terminology.\nPrevious revisions: 03/89-DRM; 06/2000-DRM,LER; 02/2005-DHK\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to sample pedon CS-5 (OSD type location) for characterization data. Other sampled pedons include CS-6, CS-30, MS-S5, and TU-W8. These samples were analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
