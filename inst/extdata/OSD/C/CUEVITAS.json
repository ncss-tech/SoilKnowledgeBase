  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuevitas series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. These well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in non-calcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, low ridges on inland, dissected coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in).",

Classification change from Aridic Ustochrepts to Aridic Haplustepts based on application of the second edition of Soil Taxonomy, 1999. The soil would classify as Petrocalcidic Haplustepts were this subgroup provided in Soil Taxonomy.\nEdited 11/2016 (RFG-GWH): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (A horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (A horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: 23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in). (Bkkm horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis was performed at the local project office for 3 pedons from Duval County. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is estimated based on laboratory data from similar soils in the geographic area.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
