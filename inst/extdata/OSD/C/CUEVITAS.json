    "content": "REMARKS: Classification change from Ustic Petrocalcids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1998 was based on geographic distribution of the soil, analysis of rainfall patterns, and range species composition and production. Classification change from Aridic Ustochrepts to Aridic Haplustepts based on application of the second edition of Soil Taxonomy, 1999. The soil would classify as Petrocalcidic Haplustepts were this subgroup provided in Soil Taxonomy.\nEdited 11/2016 (RFG-GWH): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (A horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (A horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: 23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in). (Bkkm horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis was performed at the local project office for 3 pedons from Duval County. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is estimated based on laboratory data from similar soils in the geographic area.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
