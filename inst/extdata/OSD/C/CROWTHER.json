  "OVERVIEW": "The Crowther series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy over sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F) at the type location.",
