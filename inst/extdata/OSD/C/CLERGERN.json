    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Typically depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  The control section is usually fine sandy loam of about 15 percent clay, but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F.  The soil is calcareous but lacks consistent zones of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  The soils are mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4."

Burnt Lake, Coski, and Dinnen soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Sawcreek soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sula and Teoculli soils have 7.5YR or yellower hue."

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured parent materials weathered from reddish brown sandstone.  Elevation ranges from about 7,500 to 8,500 feet.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches, most of which falls during the spring and summer."
