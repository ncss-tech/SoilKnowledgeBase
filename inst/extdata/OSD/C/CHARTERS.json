  "OVERVIEW": "The Charters series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in mountains, canyons and intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
