Depth to the 2Bwb horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section consists of 90 to 95 percent pyroclastic material, mostly volcanic pumice from 2 mm to l inch in diameter.  The l5 bar water is less than 20 percent based on the whole soil in the control section.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon ranges from very dark grayish brown to black.  It ranges from 20 to 35 percent pumiceous cinders.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5, 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very cindery sandy loam or very cindery loamy sand.\nThe C horizon ranges from yellow to very pale brown, and from 60 to 95 percent pumiceous cinders.  The 2Bwb horizon, where present, ranges from dark yellowish brown to dark brown.  It is silt loam or loam with 0 to l0 percent hard gravel."
