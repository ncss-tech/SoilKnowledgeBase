    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  Chert, sandstone fragments and channers or pebbles range from 0 to 50 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 35 percent in the B and C horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is a silt loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nWhere present, the BA horizon has colors and textures transitional of the A and B horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common. Some pedons can have a thin upper subhorizon with hue of 7.5YR.  Some pedons have subhorizons which consist of a mixture of colors in shades of red, brown, and yellow.  Texture is silty clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  In pedons greater than 60 inches to bedrock, the percent clay decreases by more than 20 percent of its maximum within a depth of 60 inches.\nWhen present the BC or C horizon are similar in color and texture to the Bt horizon."

Boden soils are shallower to bedrock and contain less than 20 percent silt. Braddock, Clifton, Groseclose, and Muse soils have a thinner solum.  Howell soils have dominant hues of 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower Bt horizons.  Sequoia soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock. Unison soils contain coarse fragments of granodiorite or greenstone. Buffstat and Clover soils formed in Triassic Basin sediments."

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  0 to 6 inches (Ap)\nArgillic horizon:  6 to 72 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, Bt6)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  4 reference samples on earlier samples (S54KY-1-10, 11, 12, & 13) from Adair County, Kentucky confirmed the mineralogy as mixed rather than kaolinitic.  Based on data the classification is changed to mixed.  Characterization data for this pedon is S82KY-003-002.  Additional pedon sampled is S82KY-003-001 (NSSL).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
