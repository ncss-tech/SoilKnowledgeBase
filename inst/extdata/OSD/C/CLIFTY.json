  "REVDATE": "04/2001",
  "STATES": "KY,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Clifty series consists of very deep well-drained soils formed in mixed alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and moderately rapid or rapid in the substratum. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 inches, and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of alluvial deposits ranges from 4 to about 20 feet.  In the 10 to 40 inch control section gravel content ranges up to 50 percent in individual subhorizons but the weighted average is 15 to 35 percent.  Gravel content at depths below 4 feet is 20 to 80 percent by volume.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 2 through 4.  Textures are silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 3 through 6; a few lithochromic mottles with 2 or lower chroma may occur at depths of more than 24 inches.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam, and less commonly, sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, values of 4 to 7, and chromas of 1 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.  These textures are stratified below depths of 4 feet in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Clifty soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from acid siltstones, sandstones, shales, and loess.  The climate is temperate and humid.  Average annual precipitation is about 42 to 50 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees to 59 degrees F."

Cuba and Steff soils contain less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand; in addition Steff soils have redoximorphic depletions within 24 inches of the surface.  Gilpin and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons.  Weikert soils have cambic horizons with more than 35 percent coarse fragments, and depths to bedrock of less than 20 inches."

Clifty soils are subject to occasional flooding of short duration in winter and spring months.  Depth to a seasonal high water table is greater than 6 feet."
