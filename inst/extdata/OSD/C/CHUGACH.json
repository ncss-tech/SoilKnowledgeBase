    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The ash influenced loess mantle ranges in thickness from 8 to 11 inches and may be bisequal. Depth to very gravelly outwash is 8 to 11 inches The upper 4 inches of the combined spodic horizons have more than 6 percent organic carbon. The silty mantle formed in loess dominated by amorphous material. Total coarse fragments in the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Depth to substratum ranges from 7 to 10 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. The texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. The texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The texture is loamy sand or sand modified by 35 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 50 inches."
