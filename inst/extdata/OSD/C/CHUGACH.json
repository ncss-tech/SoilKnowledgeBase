  "OVERVIEW": "The Chugach series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of ash influenced loess overlying very gravelly glacial outwash. Chugach soils are on mountains and structural benches. Slopes range from 3 to 85 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

The silty mantle formed in loess dominated by amorphous material. Total coarse fragments in the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Depth to substratum ranges from 7 to 10 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. The texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. The texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The texture is loamy sand or sand modified by 35 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."
