  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 22 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash and from 5 to 35 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy outwash and from 0 to 10 percent in the till.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, but it ranges to neutral in the A or Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substrata.  Redox accumulations and saturation occur below the spodic horizon, but within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or it is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 ot 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the A or Ap horizon is loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  Bw horizons with spodic colors have reaction more than 5.9 or organic carbon less than 0.6 percent or both. Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is glacial till.  Texture straddles the sandy loam/loamy sand particle-size break and is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Croswell, Cublake, Gilchrist, Halfaday, Heintz, Manitowish, and Mattix series.  Croswell and Halfaday soils are sandy throughout the series control section.  Cublake soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have less than 5 percent rock fragments there.  Gilchrist and Heintz soils have carbonates within 40 inches.  Manitowish soils have a 10 to 20 inch thick loamy mantle in the upper part of the series control section.  Mattix soils have a loamy  mantle 5 to 15 inches thick; have an apparent water table at a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 feet; and have free carbonates within a depth of 25 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Croswood soils are in outwash-veneered areas of moraines and drumlins.  They formed in deep sandy deposits underlain by glacial till.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1700 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Augwood soils are in a drainage sequence with the Croswood soils.  The excessively drained Vilas soils, the moderately well drained Croswell soils, the somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils, and the poorly drained Kinross soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the sandy deposits are more than 60 inches deep."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderate in the underlying till.  Croswood soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Mature forests are mostly red maple, northern red oak, paper birch, eastern white pine, and red pine, but balsam fir and quaking aspen are in most stands.  Some areas have been cleared and are being used for cropland and pastureland.  Corn, small grain, and hay are the main crops.  Some areas formerly used as cropland are now idle or planted to pine trees."
