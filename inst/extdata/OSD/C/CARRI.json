  "OVERVIEW": "The Carri series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite.  Carri soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
