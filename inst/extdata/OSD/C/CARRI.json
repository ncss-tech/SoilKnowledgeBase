Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils receive most of the annual precipitation in the spring and fall and are in LRR-E or LRR-G.

Celacy soils have a paralithic contact at moderate depths.  Celavar soils are continuously moist in some part from November through March.  Evpark, Elwop, Gateson, Nyjack and Oldwolf soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Nyjack soils also have C horizons containing 5 to 30 percent gravel-size pumice.  Ribera soils have segregated calcium carbonate in the lower part of the solum."
