  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 56 to 114 cm (22 to 45 in). Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments, mainly channers and gravel of siltstone, shale and sandstone, make up 3 to 15 percent of the surface layer, 5 to 30 percent of the subsoil and 15 to 45 percent of the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, unless limed.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6 with few to common, fine to medium faint or distinct low and high chroma redoximorphic features at depths of 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in). It is silt loam or loam in fine earth fraction with more than 60 percent silt plus very fine sand. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction with more than 60 percent silt plus very fine sand. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the North Meadow, Pittstown, Pompton, Rainbow, Sutton, Wapping, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge. North Meadow has a loamy mantle of human transported material over till.  Pittstown, Rainbow, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge soils all have compact substrata (or horizon). In addition, Wilbraham soils have low chroma iron depletions throughout the B horizon. Pompton soils formed in outwash and have stratified sand and gravel C horizons. Sutton soils contain more sand throughout with less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. Also, rock fragments in Sutton soils are dominated by schist, gneiss and granite. Wapping soils have a lithologic discontinuity, having formed in a silty mantle that overlies till.\nLudlow, Montesa, and Watchaug series are in similar families. Ludlow soils have compact substrata (or horizon). Montesa soils formed in alluvium and receive 1778 to 2794 mm (70 to 110 in) of precipitation annually. Watchaug soils have 5YR or redder hues throughout. Langford, Mardin and Schuyler series are similar soils in related families. Langford and Mardin soils contain fragipans. Schuyler soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chautauqua soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on till plains, upland hilltops and valley side slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from siltstone, fine grained sandstone and smaller amounts of shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in.) and mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C. (42 to 50 degrees F.)"

Also associated are finer textured, wetter Fremont soils and finer textured Schuyler and Langford soils. Well drained coarser textured Chenango soils are on adjacent lower-lying outwash terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Chautauqua had previously been mapped as a coarse-loamy variant of the Schuyler series.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (7 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 86 cm (7 to 34 in) (Bw horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Chautauqua series can be found at the Cornell University Soils Laboratory Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
