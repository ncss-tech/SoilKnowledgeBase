  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks such as schist or gneiss.   Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,670 to 2,710 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
