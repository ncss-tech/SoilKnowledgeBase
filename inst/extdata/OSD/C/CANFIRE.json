  "OVERVIEW": "The Canfire series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks.  Canfire soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
