    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chehalem soils are on terraces and smooth, convex alluvial fans formed at the mouth of small, usually intermittent streams that have cut through sedimentary and volcanic rock hills. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Elevation ranges from 150 to 900 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average July temperature is 66 degrees F. and the average January temperature is 39 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."
