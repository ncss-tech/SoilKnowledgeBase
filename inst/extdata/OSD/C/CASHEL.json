  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically is silty clay or clay in the major part averaging between 50 and 60 percent clay, but ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay including silty clay loam with or without thin strata of silt loam.  The upper horizons are laminated or finely stratified.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  One or more Ab horizons are within depths of 60 inches in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It is finely stratified in uncultivated areas.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon below the Ap horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is laminated silty clay or silty clay loam but includes clay with or without thin strata of silt loam.  It contains 1 to 10 percent carbonates diffused throughout the soil; and some accumulations as threads or masses.  Some pedons have fragments of snail shells.  It does not have redoximorphic features in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cashel soils are on flood plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  Stream meanders and channels cut up the soil areas in places.  The soil formed in recent alluvium washed from fine-textured soils high in organic matter.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 22 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bearden, Colvin, Fairdale, Fargo, Hegne, La Prairie, Ludden, Nutley, Overly and Wahpeton soils.  Bearden, Colvin and Overly soils are on nearby lake plains higher on the landscape above the flood plain.  These soils are fine-silty and have regular decrease in organic matter.  Fairdale, La Prairie and Ludden soils are on the same flood plain as Cashel soils.  Fairdale and La Prairie soils are fine-loamy.  Ludden soils have mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and are poorly drained.  Fargo, Hegne and Nutley soils are on adjacent lake plains higher on the landscape.  Fargo soils have a regular decrease in organic matter and Bw horizons.  Hegne soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Nutley soils have a mollic epipedon and a regular decrease of organic carbon with depth.  Wahpeton soils are on levees and less frequently flooded areas on the flood plains.  They have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Moderately slow or slow permeability.  Runoff is negligible to very high depending on slope.  These soils are flooded early in the spring following snow melt and after severe summer storms.  They have a seasonal high water table at depths of 2 to 4 feet during and immediately after periods of flooding."
