Thickness of the solum is 14 to 24 inches.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 25 percent unweathered pebbles and 15 to 80 percent weathered pebbles by weighted average.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid throughout.  The A horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.\nThe Bs horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent unweathered pebbles and 0 to 20 percent weathered pebbles.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly silt loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Comar soils are on foothills and mountain backslopes and toeslopes at elevations of 300 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from siltstone slightly modified by glacial till with a surficial admixture of volcanic ash.  Comar soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 50 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is 35 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial over loamy, mixed, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 5 inches and a spodic horizon from 5 to 16 incheds.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does have the micro morphology, i.e. silt-sized pellets and cracked coatings.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
