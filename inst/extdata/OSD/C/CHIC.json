  "OVERVIEW": "The Chic series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and eolian materials from volcanic and sedimentary rock.  Chic soils are on cinder cones and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
