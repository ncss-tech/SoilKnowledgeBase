These soils are formed in colluvium and eolian materials derived dominantly from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.   Elevations range from 4000 to 5200 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 150 to 165 days."
