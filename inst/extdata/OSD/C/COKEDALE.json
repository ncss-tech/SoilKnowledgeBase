    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has from 8 to 16 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser material.  The lower part of the particle-size control section is sand or loamy sand and has 0 to 35 percent channers.  Depth to coarse-textured material ranges from 16 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5B, 5Y, 2.5Y or is neutral; value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma  of 0, 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5B, 5GY, 5Y or is neutral; value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 0, 1, or  2 moist and dry and is mottled.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y; value is 2 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2  moist and dry.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.  Soil reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.  Channer size rock fragments average from 0 to 35 percent above 40 inches. Below 40 inches the substratum is stratified loamy sand to very channery sand."
