The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for sample number S61NM7-7(1-12) (L.H. Gile and R.B. Grossman, 1979. The Desert Project Soil Monograph. Document PB80-135304. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
