  "OVERVIEW": "The Cruces series consists of very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvial and eolian sediments from mixed sources. Cruces soils are on broad basin floors with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
