  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Colts Neck soils were previously classified as Typic Rhodudults. They originally had a range in value (moist) of 3 or 4 in the argillic horizon and typically have hue of 5YR and value of 4, which does not qualify them for a Rhodic great group.  The Ap horizon typically has a value of 3 and is more than 7 inches thick, indicating a humic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 35 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(S):  NJ0029, NJ0089 (GRAVELLY)\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNJ0029 COLTS NECK  0- 40     -        -       -         -\nNJ0089 COLTS NECK  2- 40     -        -       -         -\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNJ0029 NONE             >6.0              -     >60\nNJ0089 NONE             >6.0              -     >60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNJ0029  0-10  LS                      0-  0  85-100  5-10    -\nNJ0029  0-10  SL L SIL                0-  0  98-100  5-20    -\nNJ0029 10-35  SL SCL GR-L             0-  0  75-100 10-30    -\nNJ0029 35-60  LS S SL                 0-  0  55-100  3-15    -\nNJ0089  0-10  GR-SL GR-L              0-  0  65-100 10-30    -\nNJ0089 10-35  SL SCL GR-L             0-  0  60-100 10-30    -\nNJ0089 35-60  LS S GR-SL              0-  0  55-100  3-15    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
