  "OVERVIEW": "The Chesbrook series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium on flood plains, stream terraces or lake terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
