  "OVERVIEW": "The Commissary series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C.",
