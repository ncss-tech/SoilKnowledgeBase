  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 90 inches.  Fine flakes of mica range from none to common in the B and C horizons.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The E horizon, where present, is 3 to 7 inches thick and has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Many pedons are mottled with varying shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8 or it is mottled in varying shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  Texture of the Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent and averages about 45 percent.  Silt content is more than 30 percent.\nThe C horizon is mottled red, gray, yellow, and brown.  Textures are sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay and are usually stratified."

The soils formed in clayey fluvial and alluvial sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual temperature is 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 59 inches near the type location."

Cahaba soils are on higher landscape positions and are well drained, have a thinner solum, and a fine-loamy control section.  Congaree soils are on adjacent flood plains, are well drained, have a fine-loamy control section, are non-acid, and do not have an argillic horizon.  Izagora soils are on similar landscape positions but have a fine-loamy control section.  Lenoir soils are on slightly lower landscape positions and are somewhat poorly drained.  Urbo soils are on adjacent flood plains, are somewhat poorly drained, and do not have an argillic horizon."
