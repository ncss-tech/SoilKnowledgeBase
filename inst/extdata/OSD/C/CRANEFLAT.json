  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Craneflat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium or till from granitoid rock. These soils are on mountainsides, mountain summits, moraines, landslides, and aprons. Slope is 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches (1,092 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F (8.3 degrees C).",
