  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy, and in addition the Cr horizon was changed to Cd.  The previous draft reflected a change in classification from medial-skeletal, frigid Typic Haplorthods to loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are andic soil properties from 0 to 34 inches, an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, and a spodic horizon from 2 to 18 inches.  The spodic horizon meets chemical criteria.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
