    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Cypress and Fausse series. The Cypress series is in MLRA 133B, at a higher elevation and in a shorter period of frost free days. The Fausse series is nonacid, has more clay and is associated with the Mississippi River system.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (Ag, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3 horizons)\nOchric  epipedon: 0 to 30  cm (0 to 12 in). (Ag horizon)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in)\nAdditional Comments: The mineralogy is assumed based on similar soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 5 pedons.
