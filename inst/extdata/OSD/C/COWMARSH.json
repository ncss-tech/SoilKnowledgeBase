  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowmarsh series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvial deposits of Holocene age.  These depressional soils are oxbows and relict channels of rivers.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1350 mm (53 in).",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Cypress and Fausse series. The Cypress series is in MLRA 133B, at a higher elevation and in a shorter period of frost free days. The Fausse series is nonacid, has more clay and is associated with the Mississippi River system.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (Ag, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3 horizons)\nOchric  epipedon: 0 to 30  cm (0 to 12 in). (Ag horizon)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in)\nAdditional Comments: The mineralogy is assumed based on similar soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 5 pedons.
