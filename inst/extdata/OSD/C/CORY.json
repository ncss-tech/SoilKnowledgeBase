Cory soils formed in loess that is 1.5 to 3 meters (5 to 10 feet) or more in thickness overlying Illinoian age drift, sandstone, limestone, shale, or siltstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1118 mm (40 to 44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 12.8 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Iva soils have a light colored surface layer on similar positions. Ragsdale soils are poorly drained soils in nearby depressions."
