The soils formed in very gravelly alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 10 to 13 inches. Most rainfall occurs during afternoon thunderstorms from July through September. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 68 to 72 degrees F. Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 4,295 feet. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."
