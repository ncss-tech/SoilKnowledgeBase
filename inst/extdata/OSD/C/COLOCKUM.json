These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 75 to 105 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches. Depth to bedrock and solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. The depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The argillic horizon is more than 20 inches thick. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section is averages 5 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have AB horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 6 dry or moist.

Colockum soils are on benches, foothills, hillslopes, canyon side slopes and lower mountain slopes. Elevation is 300 to 4,200 feet (Chelan Co. Area 1,000 to 3,200 feet; Kittitas and Yakima Co. Area 2,200 to 4,200 feet; Klickitat Co. Area 300 to 2,800 feet) depending upon latitude and aspect. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches. The average January temperature is 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 70 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 170 days."

Bakeoven soils are on uplands and are loamy-skeletal and are 4 to 12 inches deep to basalt. Conconully soils are on moraines and foothills and Timentwa soils are on uplands and both soils lack argillic horizons. Cowiche soils are on uplands and have an aridic moisture regime. Tronsen soils are on mountainsides and are clayey-skeletal. Zen soils are on plateaus and are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact and have an aridic moisture regime."
