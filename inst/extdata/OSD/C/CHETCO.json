  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated during the winter season.  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  Soil depth is greater than 60 inches, but rooting depth is limited by the seasonal water table that ranges in depth from 0 to 18 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  Redox features range from few to many and faint to prominent in the A and Bw horizons and from none to many and faint to distinct in the C horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  Soil reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or less moist and dry.  It is light silty clay loam in the upper part and silty clay and heavy silty clay loam in the lower part.  It is 27 to 50 percent clay.  Soil reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent clay.  Thin lenses of sandier material are below 40 inches in some pedons."

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in silty marine alluvium in tidal flats.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 44 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is 59 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 300 days.  Chetco soils are on the Ingram geomorphic surface (stream environment) or the Tenmile surface (marine enviroment)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coquille, Langlois, and Nestucca soils.  Coquille soils occur along tide-influenced flood plains, are fine-silty, and have moist chroma of 2 or more at a depth of 10 to 30 inches.  Langlois soils occur on old tidal flats and flood plains, lack a Bw horizon, and have gleyed C horizons.  Nestucca soils occur on flood plains above tidal overflow, are fine-silty, and are somewhat poorly drained."
