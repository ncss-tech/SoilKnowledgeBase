  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chesley series consists of deep, well drained soils on ridges, side slopes and shoulders of foothills and low mountains.  They formed in loess and material from fine grained quartzites and siltite of the Libby and Striped Peak formations of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 7 to 70 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",
