These soils formed in loess and fine grained quartzites or siltite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash at elevations of 2,800 to 4,200 feet (854 to 1280 meters).  The average annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 43 inches (635 to 1092 mm).  The frost free season is 85 to 120 days."
