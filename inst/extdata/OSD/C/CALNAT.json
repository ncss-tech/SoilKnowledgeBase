Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 4,010 feet in the Honey Lake valley and 5,330 to 5,350 feet on the Madeline Plains.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches in the Honey Lake Valley and 12 to 14 inches on the Madeline Plains.  Most areas receive 10 to 20 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 52 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F.and the mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days on the Madeline Plains and 100 to 130 days in the Honey Lake Valley."
