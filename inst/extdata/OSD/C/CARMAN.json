  "OVERVIEW": "The Carman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderate to moderately slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy, old alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping areas of old stream terraces along the western side of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 69 mm (27 in), and the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
