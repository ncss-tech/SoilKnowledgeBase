  "OVERVIEW": "The Condido series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  These well drained, very slowly permeable clayey soils formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous, weakly cemented siltstone sediments of the Catahoula Formation.  These soils are on nearly level uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

It is moderately or strongly cemented caliche interbedded with noncalcareous siltstone in the lower part.  It has a laminar cap that is 1/8 to 1-1/2 inches thick.   Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 7.5 YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 , and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is weakly cemented, calcareous siltstone of silt loam or loam texture.  This layer slakes in water.  Calcium carbonate films, threads, and soft masses range form 5 to 35 percent by volume; calcium carbonate films and threads range from thin films to 1/2 inch thick and are 1/2 to 8 inches apart and decrease in the lower part.

Some of the materials in the Bkm horizon slake in water, however, this horizon looks and acts like a petrocalcic.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from surface to 18 inches.\nPetrocalcic horizon - from 18 to 24 inches.\nCr feature- This is not a paralithic layer. Although it slakes in water, it has cracks less than 4 inches apart.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL S88TX-255-003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
