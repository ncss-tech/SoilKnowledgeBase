    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 10 to 20 inches over a petrocalcic horizon.\nThe A1 and A2 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or a neutral color of 2/0.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A3 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or a neutral color of 2/0.  Angular and platelike caliche fragments range from 15 to 25 percent by volume.  Fragments are 1/8 to 1 inch wide and 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick and 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches long.  Some of these fragments slake in water.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkm horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is moderately or strongly cemented caliche interbedded with noncalcareous siltstone in the lower part.  It has a laminar cap that is 1/8 to 1-1/2 inches thick.   Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 7.5 YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 , and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is weakly cemented, calcareous siltstone of silt loam or loam texture.  This layer slakes in water.  Calcium carbonate films, threads, and soft masses range form 5 to 35 percent by volume; calcium carbonate films and threads range from thin films to 1/2 inch thick and are 1/2 to 8 inches apart and decrease in the lower part.   Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 45 percent.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is weakly cemented siltstone with silt loam or loam texture.  This material slakes in water.  Some pedons have a few thin lenses of calcium carbonate mainly in the upper part of the horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Jardin, Quihi, Parrita, Pavelek and Yologo series.  Jardin soils have a loamy control section and mixed mineralogy.  The Quihi soils have a clayey-skeletal control section.  The Parrita soils have mixed mineralogy and an argillic horizon.  The Pavelek soils are calcareous in the solum.  The Yologo soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section."

The soil formed in clayey materials over thick beds of noncalcareous, weakly cemented siltstone of the Catahoula formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 degrees to 74 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 275 to 290 days.  Elevation ranges from 380 to 495 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 31 to 44."

Pavelek, Ecleto, Fashing, and Weigang soils occur on similar positions.  Eloso, Rosenbrock, and Tordia soils occur on similar to slightly lower positions in the landscape.  In addition, Fashing soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  Ecleto and Weigang soils have argillic horizons.  Also, Weigang soils have loamy control sections.  Eloso, Rosenbrock, and Tordia soils have a fine particle-size control section and are more than 20 inches deep."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Scattered areas are cultivated with small grains and grain sorghum.  Some areas are used as bermudagrass pasture and hayland.  Native grasses include Texas wintergrass, sideoats grama, bristlegrasses, Hall's panicum, Texas grama, threeawns, and red grama.  Woody vegetation is mainly agarito, prickly pear, lotebush, mesquite, spiny hackberry, persimmon, blackbrush, and live oak."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Fashing, Pettus, and Weigang series.  Some of the materials in the Bkm horizon slake in water, however, this horizon looks and acts like a petrocalcic.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from surface to 18 inches.\nPetrocalcic horizon - from 18 to 24 inches.\nCr feature- This is not a paralithic layer. Although it slakes in water, it has cracks less than 4 inches apart.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL S88TX-255-003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
