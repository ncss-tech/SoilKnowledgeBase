The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 40 inches in thickness and typically extends into or through the Bt horizons.  The solum contains less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam but is silty clay in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma of 1 is confined to the Btg1 horizon and does not extend to depths of more than 30 inches.  It typically is silty clay, but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It contains an estimated 35 to 55 percent clay.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate.  Accumulations of gypsum and other salts are few to many in most pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 2Bkg horizons of loam or clay loam below 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam, but some is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Accumulations of carbonates are few or common in most pedons.  Visible nests of gypsum are present in most pedons.  Some pedons have 2C horizons."

The Bremer, Edinburg, Haig, Taintor, and Winterset soils do not have free calcium carbonate within depths of 60 inches.  In addition, the Haig and Taintor soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick.  Crossplain soils contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Mazaska soils are more acid, have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick, and have 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments composed primarily of shale.  Minnetonka soils have thinner mollic epipedons and have a wetter soil moisture control section.  Virden soils have thinner mollic epipedons.  Worthing soils are more poorly drained and have chroma of 1 or less throughout the solum."

Egan and Wentworth soils are well drained and do not have an argillic horizon and are on landscapes above the Chancellor soils.  Tetonka soils have an E horizon and are in depressions.  The Trent and Viborg soils are fine-silty and in the shallower, better drained swales and drainageways.  Wakonda soils have a calcic horizon and are at edges of depressions and swales.  Whitewood soils are fine-silty and are in similar positions as the Chancellor soils.  Worthing soils are in depressions."
