  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. The depth to the first lamellae ranges from 14 to 48 inches. Typically, rock fragments are lacking, but some pedons contain up to 5 percent fine gravel above 48 inches, and up to 35 percent fine gravel below 48 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral in the solum, and strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon. Some pedons have carbonates below 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4, moist. Dry colors have value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sand to very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak granular, subangular blocky, or it is single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 in the upper part and 2 to 8 in the lower part. Texture is dominantly fine sand or loamy fine sand with some pedons containing thin very fine sand subhorizons. It is massive or single grain, or has weak granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe (E and Bt) horizon has properties similar to the E horizon and contains horizontal lamellae (Bt) that have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6, and are typically darker colored than the soil in the interlamellar areas. The lamellae are fine sand to fine sandy loam and are friable to firm. In some pedons, some of the lamellae do not have a distinct increase in clay content. Textures are for the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons may have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons have redoximorphic features below 40 inches. Texture is dominantly fine sand or loamy fine sand; however, some pedons have contrasting layers of finer textured deposits, or coarser deposits ranging to fine gravel, below depths of 48 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chelsea, Coloma, Grinter (T), Lakin, and Millrock series. None of these series allow free carbonates. Chelsea soils are in LRR M and to lesser extent in the western part of LRR L; they commonly contain more and thicker lamellae than Colonie soils. Coloma and Grinter (T) soils have less than 50 percent fine and very fine sand in the particle-size control section. Lakin soils are at elevations above 860 feet msl. Millrock soils have buried A horizons. (See remarks for additional information.)"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Colonie soils are on slight rises, summits, shoulders, back slopes and foot slopes of Wisconsin age lake plains, dunes, outwash plains, deltas, and beach ridges. Slopes are mostly nearly level to rolling, but some are moderately steep or steep and the gradient ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Colonie soils formed in glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial (outwash) materials and associated eolian deposits dominated by fine and very fine sand. Elevations range from 95 to 860 feet msl. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 40 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. The mean growing season ranges from 120 to 200 days."

Delaware and Unadilla are typically associated in the extreme southern portions of MLRA 144A. Amboy, Wallington, and Williamson soils have fragipans and formed in silty glaciolacustrine sediments. Arkport, Delaware, Galen, Lamson, and Minoa soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Collamer, Dunkirk, and Niagara soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and have argillic horizons. Elnora and Stafford are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils in a drainage sequence with Colonie soils. The well drained Unadilla soils are coarse-silty."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Some areas are in woodlots of sugar maple, red oak, and other hardwoods. About 1/4 to 1/2 of the acreage is cultivated. Large areas are idle and are covered with poverty grass, quack grass, annual weeds, and shrubs such as sumac. Locally, the soil is used intensively for growing vegetables and deciduous fruits, and less intensively in other places for growing corn and hay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The taxonomic classification was changed from Argic Udipsamments to Lamellic Udipsamments due to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nAdditional study is needed to provide more definitive differentiation from the Lakin and Chelsea series. Presently, these series are geographically separated. Continuing this approach is practical for now.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Lamellic Subgroup - as evidenced by lamellae within 200 cm of the mineral soil surface (E and Bt1, and E and Bt2 horizons).\nNew surface runoff class names are not comparable to or the same definitions as the old names.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available from NSSL for pedon sample numbers - S61NY37 9, S61NY37-4, and S57NY28-1. Also data from pedon AB-110, sample numbers 11845 to 11856, and pedon AB-117, sample numbers 15278 to 15289 from Ashtabula County, Ohio, and pedon LK-7, sample numbers 19567 to 19572 from Lake County, Ohio, analysis by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
