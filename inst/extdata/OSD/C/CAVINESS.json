    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon:  The zone from 3 to 21 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 32 to 51 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact:  Sandstone bedrock at 58 inches.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 32 to 51 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nThe base saturation by sum of cations is presumed to be greater than 35 percent in the argillic horizon and hence this soil is not an Ultisol. This needs further study.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
