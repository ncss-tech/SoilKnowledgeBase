  "OVERVIEW": "The Caviness series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone.  Caviness soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

(Bt horizon)\nLithic contact:  Sandstone bedrock at 58 inches.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 32 to 51 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nThe base saturation by sum of cations is presumed to be greater than 35 percent in the argillic horizon and hence this soil is not an Ultisol. This needs further study.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998"
