  "OVERVIEW": "The Clementsville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weatherd from rhyolite a with loess influence.  Clementsville soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 4 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
