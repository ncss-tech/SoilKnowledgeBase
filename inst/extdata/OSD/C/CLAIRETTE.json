  "OVERVIEW": "The Clairette series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey slope alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These very gently sloping to moderately sloping soils occur on base slopes and head slopes of ridges on hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm (31 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17.6 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
