However, this soil did not fit the proper classification of what is presently called Rasset. Also, most of the lamellae, identified previously as sandy loam and sandy clay loam, is now loamy sand or loamy fine sand due to reevaluation of texture of lamellae. 1/12/2011-TYPE LOCATION error corrected.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
