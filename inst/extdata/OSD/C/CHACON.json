A few areas are irrigated for producing cotton, corn, grain sorghum, small grain, truck crops, and introduced grasses.  The original plant community was open grassland dominated by mid-grasses with occasional mesquite trees and woody shrubs.  Bundleflower, bush sunflower and orange zexmania are important forbs.  In early stages of retrogression, such plants are pink pappusgrass and plains bristlegrass increase but decrease with further deterioration.  Other plants which increase or invade are hooded windmillgrass, Hall's panicum, tobosa grass, curley mesquitegrass, threeawns, red grama, mesquite, whitebrush, blackbrush, condalias, wolfberry, spiny hackberry, guyacan, guajillo, twisted acacia, Texas persimmon, and prickly pear cactus."
