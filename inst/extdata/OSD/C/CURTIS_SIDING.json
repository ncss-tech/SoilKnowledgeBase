  "OVERVIEW": "The Curtis Siding series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in noncalcareous sandy alluvium containing a moderate amount of gravel. Curtis Siding soils are on alluvial fans and margin of terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches and occurs mainly in the winter and spring. The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is about 65 degrees to 72 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
