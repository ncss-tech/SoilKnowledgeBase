  "OVERVIEW": "The Chippy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced slope alluvium and alluvium derived from non-calcareous sedimentary rock. Chippy soils are on hillslopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 16 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 650 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.",
