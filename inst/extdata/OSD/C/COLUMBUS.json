Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe B22t and B23t horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 with mottles in shades of brown, gray, or red, or the horizons are mottled in shades of brown, gray, and red.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 24 inches of the Bt horizon.  Total thickness of the Bt horizon is from 18 to 36 inches.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has clay content that ranges from 18 to 33 percent and has more than 25 percent silt.  Texture is clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe B3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 with mottles in shades of brown and red, or it is mottled in shades of gray, brown, and red.

Abell, Altavista, Bertie, and Tetotum soils have mixed mineralogy. Cahaba soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.  Eunola soils have less than 25 percent silt in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Johns soils have contrasting textures in the control section.  Pelion soils have common coarse flakes of mica and slightly brittle consistence in the lower B horizons.  Whitwell soils have up to 15 percent cobblestones and commonly have stratified C horizons."
