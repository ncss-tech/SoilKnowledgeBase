Abell, Altavista, Bertie, and Tetotum soils have mixed mineralogy. Cahaba soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.  Eunola soils have less than 25 percent silt in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Johns soils have contrasting textures in the control section.  Pelion soils have common coarse flakes of mica and slightly brittle consistence in the lower B horizons.  Whitwell soils have up to 15 percent cobblestones and commonly have stratified C horizons."
