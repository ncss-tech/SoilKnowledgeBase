  "OVERVIEW": "The Carryback series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff. Carryback soils are on tablelands and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
