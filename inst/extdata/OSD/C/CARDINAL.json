  "OVERVIEW": "The Cardinal series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments on dissected Wisconsin age lake plains and terraces. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 990 millimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
