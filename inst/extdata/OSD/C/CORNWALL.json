  "OVERVIEW": "The Cornwall series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in loess or silty sediments and valley fill materials.  These soils are on high terraces, valley footslopes, sinkholes, and intravalley ridge points.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

Aslinger and Britwater soils are fine-loamy and are on lower terrace levels. Bearthicket soils are well drained and are on lower terrace levels.  Clarksville soils are loamy-skeletal and are on adjacent side slopes.  Roselle soils are fine-loamy and are at higher elevations.  Marquand soils have a decrease in clay in the lower part of the control section, and are on similar landscape positions. Tilk soils are loamy-skeletal and are on flood plains. In addition, none of these soils except Aslinger have a brittle (2Btx) layer."
