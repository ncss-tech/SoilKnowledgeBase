  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cornwall soils are on high terraces, valley footslopes, intravalley ridge points, and in sinkholes.  These soils formed in loess or silty sediments and loamy valley fill materials. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 47 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aslinger, Bearthicket, Britwater, Clarksville, Marquand, Roselle, and Tilk soils. Aslinger and Britwater soils are fine-loamy and are on lower terrace levels. Bearthicket soils are well drained and are on lower terrace levels.  Clarksville soils are loamy-skeletal and are on adjacent side slopes.  Roselle soils are fine-loamy and are at higher elevations.  Marquand soils have a decrease in clay in the lower part of the control section, and are on similar landscape positions. Tilk soils are loamy-skeletal and are on flood plains. In addition, none of these soils except Aslinger have a brittle (2Btx) layer."
