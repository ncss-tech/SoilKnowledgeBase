In some areas, part of the natric horizon has a sodium-adsorption-ratio of less than 13.   The depth to the firm, brittle layer is 6 to 34 inches.  The soil from a depth of 8 to 22 inches is usually dry in all parts from April 15 until November 30 and is moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days the rest of the year.  Carbonates may or may not be present.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3; or 7.5YR 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.  It has 5 to 30 percent gravel and cobbles.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a dry color of 7.5YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4; or 5YR 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 3/4,  or 5YR 3/4.  It has an average clay content of 20 to 35 percent and 5 to 30 percent gravel and cobbles.  In some pedons, part of the Bt horizon is weakly cemented with silica.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/4 or 4/6 and moist color of 7.5YR 4/6 or 4/4.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent gravel.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  In most pedons, the BC horizon is weakly cemented with silica.  Some pedons do not have BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has a dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 8/2, 6/4, 6/2, 5/6, 5/4 or 4/6 and moist color of 10YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/4,; 7.5YR 6/4, 4/6, or 4/4.  It is stratified with sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, and loamy coarse sand with 1 to 8 percent clay and 5 to 55 percent gravel and cobbles.  In some or all parts, it is weakly cemented with silica.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cerrocoso soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Most areas are dissected by ephemeral channels and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed from alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks with sedimentary and metavolcanic rocks in some areas.   Elevation is 2,100 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and somewhat cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 6 inches, some occurs as snow in the winter.  The average January temperature is about  43 degrees F, and the  average July temperature is about 86 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.   The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:   When the soil was described on 11/20/84,  it was slightly moist from an unsually heavy rainstorm which delivered 1.6 inches of rain to the area on August 15, 1984.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nNatric horizon - the zone from 3 to 21 inches  (2Bt, 2Btkn1 and 2Btkn2 horizons).   Clay films are present and the increase in clay content is more than 10 percent.   The sodium-adsorption-ratio is more than 13 in at least part of the horizon.\nDuric layer - from 21 to 60 inches  (3BCqn, 4Ckq1 and 5Ckq2 horizons). This layer is firm and brittle even after prolonged soaking, and it does not slake in hydrochloric acid.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory samples (S84CA-029-019-1 through 7; 853201 through 8533207).\nSeries reclassified on September, 1994.  Competing series not reviewed at that time.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 8/1998.
