  "OVERVIEW": "The Consul series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments overlying alkaline shale.  They are on uplands of the Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas Blackland Prairie and the Southern Coastal Plain major land resource areas.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Ashford soils are very deep and formed in clayey alluvium on Pleistocene-age terraces.  Eutaw soils are very deep and overlie chalk or alkaline clays.  Mayhew soils have a fine particle-size control section."
