Texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where lime has been added.\nThe Bssg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown and red range from common to many.  Black or brown concretions and/or nodules (Fe & Mn oxides) range from few to common.  Texture is clay.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid in the upper part and ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered shale.  It has platy and conchoidal rock structure.  Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It can be dug with difficulty with hand tools and is rippable by heavy equipment."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Ashford and the Eutaw series in the same family and the Mayhew series in a closely similar family.  Ashford soils are very deep and formed in clayey alluvium on Pleistocene-age terraces.  Eutaw soils are very deep and overlie chalk or alkaline clays.  Mayhew soils have a fine particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Consul soils are on broad, nearly level ridgetops in uplands of the Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas Blackland Prairie and the Southern Coastal Plain MLRA's.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in clayey sediments overlying thick beds of alkaline shale.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."

Houlka soils are in flood plains and are subject to frequent flooding.  Oktibbeha and Vaiden soils are on similar positions as Consul soils but at slightly lower elevations.  They are underlain by chalk bedrock. Wilcox soils are on lower slopes and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the upper part of the solum."
