  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabreros series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to monzonite bedrock. Cabreros soils formed in slope alluvium and eolian material derived from monzonite on toeslopes of structural benches on sills.  Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
