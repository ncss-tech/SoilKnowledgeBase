  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric horizon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon: from a depth of 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 43 cm (8 to 17 inches) (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)\nOrtstein feature: cementation in 52 to 76 percent of the Bs3 and Bs4 horizons.\nThis soil was placed in an ortstein family although the ortstein is not in the spodic horizon. The assumed intent of the ortstein family class is to include Spodosols with greater than 50 percent cemented spodic materials, regardless of where that cemented material occurs in the pedon. The ortstein in this pedon would fit that criteria; it has the color and chemical properties of spodic materials, is cemented, and is more than 50 percent of the Bs3 and Bs4 horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record MI0752.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
