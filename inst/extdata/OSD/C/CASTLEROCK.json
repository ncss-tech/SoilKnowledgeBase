  "OVERVIEW": "The Castlerock series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium from tuff and volcaniclastic sediments. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
