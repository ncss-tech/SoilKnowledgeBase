  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Cedarsprings soils are in valleys and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
