  "OVERVIEW": "The Citypoint series consists of very poorly drained organic soils which are moderately deep or deep to a paralithic contact of interbedded sandstone and shale on pediments.  They formed in organic material 16 to 51 inches thick overlying a thin layer of residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic layers; slow to rapid in the C horizon; and very slow to moderately slow in the Cr horizon.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic layers and depth to the C horizon ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  Pedons with less than 20 inches of organic material, have a C horizon which extends to at least 20 inches.  Fibers are mostly of herbaceous origin.  The volume of wood fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid throughout (pH less than 5.1 in water 1:1).  Saturation occurs at or above the surface much of the year in most years.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 to 4 and chroma is 2 or 3.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers are dominantly muck (sapric material) but in some pedons they have thin layers of mucky peat (hemic material) or peat (fibric material).  The organic layers have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or are neutral in hue.  Value is 2 to 4 and chroma is 0 to 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or 5G; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.  The texture ranges from sand to clay, reflecting the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or 5G; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It consists of interbedded layers of sandstone and shale."

Loxley and Seelyeville soils have organic layers more than 51 inches thick and do not have bedrock within 60 inches. In addition, Seelyeville soils are euic.  Beseman and Cathro soils have 12 or more inches of loamy mineral soil material at depths of 16 to 51 inches.  In addition, Cathro soils are euic.  Dawsil, Dawson, and Markey soils have 12 or more inches of sandy mineral soil material at depths of 16 to 51 inches.  In addition, Markey soils are euic."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1400 feet."

The very poorly drained Loxley soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Citypoint soils where the organic layer is more than 51 inches thick.  The poorly drained Elm Lake soils and Veedum soils are in similar landscape positions where the organic layer is thin or absent.  The somewhat poorly drained Fairchild and Merrillan soils, and the moderately well drained Humbird and Ludington soils are nearby on higher lying, better drained sites."
