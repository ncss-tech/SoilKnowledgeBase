  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mineral solum and depth to densic materials from the mineral surface range from 25 to 50 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Texture is typically fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction, but includes sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, and loam. Some pedons have an E horizon that is commonly silt loam. The clay content in the particle-size control section averages less than 10 percent. Rock fragments are mostly gravel, channers, and cobbles with a few stones, and range from 5 to 30 percent throughout the mineral solum and 5 to 35 percent in the substratum. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Iron depletions in the solum are between depths of 18 to 41 cm from the mineral soil surface.\nThe O horizons, where present, consist of slightly, intermediately, and/or highly decomposed plant material. The Oa horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon that is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3. A horizons are 0 to 10 cm thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or less.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Aggregation of material into structural units in the Cd horizon is interpreted as geogenic and is inherited from the parent material. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Telos series is in the same family. Telos soils have an average clay content of 10 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe Daigle series is in a related family. Daigle soils have an average clay content of 18 to 27 percent in the particle-size control section, and have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colonel soils are on nearly level to moderately steep slopes in glaciated uplands. They are typically on slightly convex to concave parts of backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes, but they also occur on till plains. The soils formed in loamy lodgment till derived mainly from schist, gneiss, phyllite, and granite. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from about 2 to 800 meters above sea level."

Berkshire, Becket, Hermon, Marlow, Monadnock, Peru, and Skerry soils are better drained and occur in higher positions on the landscape. Brayton and Pillsbury soils are wetter and are in lower positions on the landscape. Lyman and Tunbridge soils are better drained, shallow and moderately deep to bedrock respectively, and occur in higher positions on the landscape."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 cm (Oa and E horizons).\nb. Albic horizon - the zone from 3 to 5 cm (E horizon).\nc. Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 23 cm (Bhs and Bs1 horizons).\nd. Aquic subgroup feature - redoximorphic features within 75 cm of the mineral soil surface (Bs2 and BC horizons and Cd layer).\ne. Densic materials - the zone from 45 to 165 cm (Cd layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for Colonel and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
