  "OVERVIEW": "The Ceboya series consists of deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fine-textured alluvial sediments of mixed origin. These soils are on broad, mountain valley flood plains and have slopes from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.",
