The slope commonly is less than 1 percent, but the range is 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in fine-textured alluvial sediments of mixed origin.  Elevations range from 7,200 to 8,500 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 110 days."
