  "OVERVIEW": "The Ceboya series consists of deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fine-textured alluvial sediments of mixed origin. These soils are on broad, mountain valley flood plains and have slopes from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about degrees C.",
