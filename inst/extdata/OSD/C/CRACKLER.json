    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is typically between 40 and 60 inches but may be greater than 60 inches in some pedons.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle and depth to the contrasting material is 14 to 25 inches.  The A and AB horizons are moderately to weakly smeary.  The ash mantle contains about 60 to 80 percent glass.  The surface has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It is silty clay loam, loam or clay loam, with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.  The lower part has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, loam and clay loam, with 18 to 35 percent clay, 40 to 70 percent gravel and 2 to 20 percent cobbles."

The soil formed in colluvium derived from argillite, with a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
