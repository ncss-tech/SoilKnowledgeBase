  "OVERVIEW": "The Crackler series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in colluvium derived from argillite, with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slope is 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle and depth to the contrasting material is 14 to 25 inches.  The A and AB horizons are moderately to weakly smeary.  The ash mantle contains about 60 to 80 percent glass.  The surface has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It is silty clay loam, loam or clay loam, with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.
