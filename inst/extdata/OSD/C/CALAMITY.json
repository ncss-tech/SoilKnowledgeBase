The coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 15 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 35 percent cobble.  Reaction throughout the profile is strongly or very strongly acid.  The organic layers consist of mucky peat or muck with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value moist of 2.5 through 3, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.   Hue is 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, values moist of 2 or 2.5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value moist from 2 to 4; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4."
