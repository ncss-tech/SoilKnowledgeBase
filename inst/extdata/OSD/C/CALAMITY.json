  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Calamity series consists of well and moderately well drained soils that are shallow to bedrock.  They formed in residuum from noncalcareous metamorphic rocks.  Calamity soils occur on upper backslopes of valley sides, headwalls of cirques, and summits and shoulders of ridges. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent, but are dominantly 60 to 75 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 130 to 220 inches.",

Reaction throughout the profile is strongly or very strongly acid.  The organic layers consist of mucky peat or muck with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value moist of 2.5 through 3, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.   Hue is 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, values moist of 2 or 2.5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value moist from 2 to 4; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4."
