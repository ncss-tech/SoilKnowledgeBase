Beavwan, Cortyzack, and Emlin soils have 25 percent decline in precipitation in July and August rather than an increase. Morval soils have a lithologic discontinuity and exhibit the soil forming factors of the High Intermountain Valleys (MLRA 51). Notter soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the Bk horizon. Nuley soils are deep, formed in material derived from metamorphic and igneous rock, and a lower MAP of 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 mm). Thunderhead soils have bedrock at depths of 22 to 40 inches (56 to 102 cm). Varney soils have a moist spring and a lower MAP of 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 mm) Villa Grove soils have a horizon of gypsum accumulation below 44 inches (112 cm), have exchangeable sodium percentage of 5 to 20 percent in the argillic horizon and a lower MAP of 7 inches (178 mm)."

Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches (355 to 432 mm) and mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F (5 to 7.2 degrees C).  Frost-free period is 100 to 119 days.  April, May and June are the driest months, with monsoonal pattern rainfall in August, September, and October.  Light to moderate rainfall and snowfall occur during the winter months."

The Foy soils are on shoulders of hillslopes and dissected fan remnants and are loamy-skeletal.  The Utecaloll soils are on summits and backslopes of hillslopes, usually higher in the landscape than the Countyline soils, and have lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  Whitesage soils are on backslopes and do not have a mollic epipedon."
