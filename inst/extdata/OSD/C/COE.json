  "OVERVIEW": "The Coe series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial sand and gravel containing appreciable amounts of shale.  Permeability is very rapid.  These soils are on outwash plains, eskers, beach ridges and terraces of valley side slopes and have slopes ranging from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 6 to 14 inches.  Some pedons do not have carbonates throughout.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments and has more than 20 percent shale in the fine sand through gravel fractions.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  The mollic epipedon typically is 7 or 8 inches thick and ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam, coarse sandy loam, gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have AC or Bk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly coarse sand, sand or loamy coarse sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Alpena and Sioux soils have less than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction of the C horizon.  Binford and Brantford soils have cambic horizons.  Binford soils are sandy and Brantford soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
