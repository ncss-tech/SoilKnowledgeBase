Rock fragments range from 20 to 40 percent by volume in the A horizon and 35 to 75 percent in the subsurface horizons, with 1/2 to 3/4 of total being 3 to 10 inches in diameter.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 7 to 24 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nB2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Clay content of the fine earth fraction ranges from 35 to 45 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y."
