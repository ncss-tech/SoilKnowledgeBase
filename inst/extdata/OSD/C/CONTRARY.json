  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev EDL-JCR-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "04/2004",
  "STATES": "KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Contrary series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in deoxidized and leached Wisconsin age loess. These soils are on moderately sloping and strongly sloping side slopes, head slopes, nose slopes, and tops of lowered interfluves on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 5 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches).",
