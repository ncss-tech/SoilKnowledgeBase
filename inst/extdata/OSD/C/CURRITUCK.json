  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Range in thickness of the organic material is typically 16 to 38 inches, with a maximum to 51 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid (in .01 M calcium chloride) in the upper organic horizons and ultra acid through moderately acid (in .01 M calcium chloride) in the mineral and lower organic horizons.  Exchangeable sodium and magnesium is less than 5 parts per thousand and sulfur content is less than 0.01 percent throughout the control section.   Organic material is mainly from herbaceous plants.\nThe surface tier is either hemic or sapric, depending on history of vegetative succession.  Mineral content ranges from 40 to 65 percent.  The surface tier is in hues of 7.5YR, 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe subsurface tier, and bottom tier, where present, is sapric material; however, thin hemic layers occur in the subsurface tier of some pedons.  The subsurface and bottom tiers, where present, are similar in color to the surface tier and in addition range to include dark olive gray (5Y 3/2), greenish gray (5GY 5/1), and dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1).  Mineral content ranges from 40 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or their mucky analogue.\nThe Cg horizons are in hues of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 to 2, greenish gray (5GY 6/1, 5/1; 5G 5/1), or dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1; 5G 4/1) sand or loamy sand.  Flakes of mica and opaques range from few to common.  A few shell fragments and gravels are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Those in closely related families are the Allemands, Handsboro, Hobonny, Istokpoga, Lafitte, Mattamuskeet, Maurepas, Ocoee, and Pamlico series.  Allemands soils have clayey sediments underlying organic layers.  Handsboro soils have subhorizons containing more than .075 percent sulfur.  Hobonny, Istokpoga, Lafitte, and Maurepas soils have organic materials greater than 51 inches thick.  In addition, Istokpoga soils have hyperthermic temperature regimes and are dominated by hemic materials.  Lafitte soils are in saline marshes and have a SAR of more than 13 or ESP of more than 15 in more than half of the subsurface tier.   Mattamuskeet and Pamlico soils are formed woody hydrophytic plants and have dysic pH ranges.  Ocoee soils are hyperthermic and they are siliceous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Currituck soils are in large fresh water marshes that are associated with a marine environment.  Elevations are below 3 feet.  They are flooded with fresh water and are bordered on the seaward side by soils that are flooded with saline water.  The soils are formed in herbaceous plant remains and sandy marine deposits.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 70 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Hobonny series, these are the Carteret, Corolla, Duckston, and Newhan series.  All of these are mineral soils.  Carteret soils are flooded daily by salt water.  Corolla, Duckston, and Newhan soils are not flooded daily."
