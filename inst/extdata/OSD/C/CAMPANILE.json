  "OVERVIEW": "The Campanile series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale. Campanile soils are on mesas and hills and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
