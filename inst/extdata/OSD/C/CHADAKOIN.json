  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, channers, and flagstones range from 5 to 35 percent by volume, in the upper part of the solum, from 15 to 50 percent in the lower part of the solum and from 10 to 65 percent in the substratum. Weighted average for rock fragment volume is less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. In some pedons there are redoximorphic features in the lower part of the B horizon. Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky, prismatic or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue, value and chroma similar to the B horizon. Fine-earth texture is sandy loam, silt loam or loam. Structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky, coarse or very coarse prismatic or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have a CB horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Fine-earth texture is sandy loam, silt loam or loam. The horizon is massive, or has prismatic or platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon.\nIn pedons that are only deep, the underlying 2R horizon is horizontal-bedded sandstone, siltstone, or shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Chatfield, Maplecrest, and Valois series are in the same family. Chatfield soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock. Maplecrest soils have 5YR or redder hue in the B horizon. Valois soils are underlain with stratified deposits below a depth of 40 inches.\nSimilar soils in other families include the Amostown and Pollux soils that are underlain with stratified very fine sand or silt. The Ashe, Cardigan, Chatfield, Ditney, Hazel, Lordstown, Marrowbone, Steinsburg, Wakeman and Yalesville soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. The Bernardston, Broadbrook, Montauk, Nantucket, Newport, Paxton, Scituate and Wethersfield soils have dense till substrata. The Brookfield, and Cheshire soils have 5YR or redder hue in the B horizon. The Charlton soils have rock fragments dominated by granite, gneiss, and schist. The Dutchess and St. Albans soils are dominated by rock fragments of slate, shale, or phyllite. The Maymead soils have rock fragments dominated by quartzite, graywacke and arkosic sandstone, have a higher mean annual soil temperature, and a higher moisture content in the solum during the growing season. The Riverhead soils have a stratified sand and gravel C horizon within a depth of 40 inches. The Satsop soils receive 60 to 80 inches of precipitation annually. Chestnut and Edneyville soils formed in residuum and have saprolite in the substrata. The Fedscreek soils formed in colluvium from residuum and have a thicker substrata."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chadakoin soils are gently sloping to very steep and are on upland till plains, hilltops and valley sides. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from siltstone, fine-grained sandstone and smaller amounts of shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 110 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1800 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Chadakoin soils are the well drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the moderately well drained Chautauqua soils, the somewhat poorly drained Busti soils and the poorly drained Ashville soils. Other nearby soils in uplands include Mardin, Langford, Bath, Schuyler, and Towerville soils. Mardin, Langford and Bath soils have fragipans; Schuyler and Towerville have fine-loamy particle size control sections. Valois and Chenango soils occur on the stream terraces and lower valley lateral moraines."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Chadakoin soils have previously been mapped as an upland Variant of Valois lacking stratified material in the substratum. This soil now classifies in the subgroup of Typic Dystrudepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 4 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 24 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from the Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory. Pedon number S83NY13-20.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
