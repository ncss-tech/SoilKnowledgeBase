  "REVDATE": "02/97",
  "STATES": "KS,NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canlon series consist of shallow, well drained and somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in residuum weathered from lime-cemented sandstone or caliche and have slopes ranging from 2 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 3 to 12 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  They are loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or gravelly loam.  Fragments of caliche, less than 3 inches in diameter and comprising as much as 35 percent by volume, are common throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the color value is as dark or darker than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, the A horizon is too thin for a mollic epipedon or the organic matter is less than 1 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The underlying bedrock is limy sandstone or caliche."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Canlon series is the only series in this family.  Competing soils in other families are the Brandenburg, Brownell, Campus, Canyon, Heizer, Kipson, and Nibson soils.  Brandenburg soils have frigid temperatures and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments within the series control section.  Brownell, Campus, Heizer, Kipson, and Nibson soils have mollic epipedons.  In addition, the Brownell soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches; Heizer soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments within the series control section; and the Kipson and Nibson soils have a paralithic contact with silty shales at depths of less than 20 inches.  Canyon soils lack a lithic contact within depths of 20 inches."
