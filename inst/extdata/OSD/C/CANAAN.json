  "OVERVIEW": "The Canaan series series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till underlain by hard bedrock.  They are on hills and mountain sides.  These soils have moderately rapid to rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 20 to 40 percent in the surface or subsurface and from 30 to 65 percent in the subsoil.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout the soil.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma or 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a Bh or Bhs horizon that has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe B horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe R layer is commonly granite or gneiss."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Killington and Thorndike series are members of the same family.  Killington soils do not have channery rock fragments and are derived from gneiss and schist.  Thorndike soils have higher silt content and rock fragments that are dominantly slate, shale and phyllite channers.  The Glover, Hollis, Lyman, and Westminster series are in related families.  All of these soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments; in addition, the Hollis soils have annual soil temperature of more than 47 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canaan soils are on rocky hills and on mountains with elevations up to about 2,500 feet.  Slope gradients typically are 15 to 50 percent, but range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils developed in a thin mantle of glacial till and in places frost fractured rock fragments derives principally from igneous rocks with less amounts of mica schist and gneiss.  Outcrops of bedrock are common to many.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 40\nto 45 degrees F., and frost-free season from 80 to 120 days."

All of these soils occupy similar landscape positions.  The Becket, Berkshire, Hermon, Marlow, and Monadnock soils are very deep.  The Lyman soils have less rock fragments in the solum and the Redstone soils formed in fragmental materials."
