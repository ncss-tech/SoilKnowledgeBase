These soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  It is assumed the soil to a depth of 40 inches has a linear extensibility of 2 to 3 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has granular and subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of l or 2 moist and dry.  This horizon is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It has subangular blocky or platy structure.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of l through 4 moist and dry.  It has few to common distinct redox features.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay.  It has angular blocky or prismatic structure.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of l through 4 moist, l through 3 dry.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam, stratified with strata or sandy loam and loamy fine sand.  It has 35 to 55 percent clay."
