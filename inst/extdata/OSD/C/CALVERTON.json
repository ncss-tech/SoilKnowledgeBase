  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 36 to 60 inches. Depth to rippable bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 40 to 80 percent in the C horizon. The soil is extremely acid or very strongly acid. The depth to the fragipan is 10 to 30 inches.\nThe Al horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 3.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or , and chroma of 2 or 3. The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. The E horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt or Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8. Both high and low chroma mottles commonly are present. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam except silt loam is allowed in subhorizons. The Bx horizon is silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Pedons with 2Bt, Bt or BC horizons below the Bx horizon have colors and textures similar to the to horizon above the Bx horizon except the 2Bt includes hue of 2.5YR and silty clay.\nThe 2C or C horizon is variegated browns, grays, reds, and yellows. It as strongly weathered shale or sandstone fragments with loamy or clayey material between the fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Belvoir, Buchanan, Cookport, Ernest, Glenville, Kedron, and Raritan series in the same family. Belvoir series have clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam Bt horizons. Buchanan, Cookport, and Ernest soils are dominated with sandstone coarse fragments. Glenville soils are dominated with schist or quartzite coarse fragments and mica flakes are also common in the B or C horizon. Kedron soils are 5YR or redder in the B horizon. Raritan soils contain water rounded gravel and are dominantly 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Calverton soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils typically on flats, low ridges, saddles, and depressions. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. They formed in material weathered from shale, siltstone, and some sandstone (Triassic Age). The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 37 to 43 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 57 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the poorly drained Albano soils and the Bucks, Kelly, Klinesville, Landsale, Penn, and Reaville soils. Bucks and Pennn soils are well drained, have redder hue, and do not have fragipans. Kelly soils do not have a fragipan. Linesville soils are shallow to rock, contain a high content of coarse fragments and do not have a fragipan as well as being redder in color than Calverton. Lansdale soils are well drained and do not have a fragipan. Reaville soils do not have fragipans, have thinner sola, and have redder hue than Calverton soils."

Lab data available.\nNote: CEC class based on NASIS CEC data from Prince William County, Virginia.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 7/84\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
