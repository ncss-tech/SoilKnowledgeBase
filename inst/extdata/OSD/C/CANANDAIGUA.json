  "STATES": "NY,PA,VT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Canandaigua series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in silty glacio-lacustrine sediments. These soils are on lowland lake plains and in depressional areas on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 9.4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is 990 millimeters.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 100 centimeters. Depth to free carbonates commonly ranges from 46 to 150 centimeters, but some pedons lack carbonates within a depth of 200 centimeters. Rock fragments are commonly absent, but range up to 10 percent by volume in random subhorizons of some pedons. Below depths of 100 centimeters rock fragments can range up 30 percent in some pedons.\nAp and A horizons have hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, or are neutral, with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2. They are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. They have weak to strong, granular or subangular blocky structure. In some pedons, O horizons range from a trace to 15 centimeters thick overlying an A horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR through 5GY, or is neutral, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam, with thin, random subhorizons in some pedons having lighter or heavier textures. Structure is very fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, either primary or within coarse or very coarse prisms. Consistence is friable to very firm. Redoximorphic accumulations are common to many. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nBC horizons are similar to Bg horizon except for presence of free carbonates in many pedons. Structure is usually weaker and can include platy structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5G or is neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4. It consists of thin strata ranging from fine sand to silty clay to a depth of at least 40 inches. Below a depth of 40 inches some pedons have a loamy, nonstratified 2C and 3C horizons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Alden soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. Birdsall and Raynham soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Lamson and Minoa soils have coarse-loamy particle size control sections. Wegatchie soils have frigid temperature regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canandaigua soils are nearly level soils mainly on glacial lake plains, but are also in depressional areas of glaciated uplands where water-sorted sediments have accumulated to a depth of more than 100 centimeters. Slope is mainly less than 1 percent, but ranges up to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.5 degrees to 11.5 degrees C.; mean frost-free season ranges from 140 to 200 days; and mean annual precipitation ranges from 715 to 1270 millimeters. The elevation commonly ranges from 30 to 396 meters but the range includes up to 533 meters above sea level."

Lighter textured Amboy, Arkport, Galen, Lamson, Minoa, Wallington and Williamson soils, and heavier textured Hudson, Lakemont, Madalin, Odessa, Rhinebeck, an Schoharie soils are also on associated lake plains. Honeoye, Lansing, and Ontario soils and their wetter associates are on nearby glacial till plains. Alton, Fredon, Howard, Palmyra, Pompton, and Red Hook soils are on associated glacial outwash terraces."
