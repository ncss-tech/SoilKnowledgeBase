    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chilton soils are on alluvial fans and piedmonts at elevations of 5,400 to 6,800 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial sediments derived mostly from sandstone, schist, gneiss and limestone.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, of which most falls during the summer.  Average annual temperature is about 46 to 53 degrees."

La Fonda soils are fine-loamy; Naplene soils are fine-silty; Redbank soils are coarse-loamy; and Witt and Scholle soils have argillic horizons.  In addition, all of these soils lack skeletal control sections."
