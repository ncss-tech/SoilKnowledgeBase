These soils are always moist, and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; peraquic moisture regime. Depth to the mineral material is 22 to 38 inches. Not all pedons have the discontinuity within the organic layer.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3, and chroma of 2 moist and 1 dry, broken, rubbed, or pressed. Reaction is very strongly acid.\nThe Oa layers have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 1 moist and dry, broken, rubbed, or pressed. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe 2Oe layer has hue of 10YR, chroma of 2, and value of 2 moist and 1 dry, broken, rubbed, or pressed. Reaction is neutral.\nThe 3Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

These soils formed in organic material over glaciolacustrine deposits. The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches. The average January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. The frost free season is 160 to 220 days."

Aabab soils are somewhat poorly drained. Copalisrock soils are 20 to 40 inches to dense glacial till. Kydaka soils are poorly drained, and are 20 to 40 inches to dense glacial till. Nuby soils are poorly drained and have silt loam textures throughout. Oyhut soils are moderately well drained and have a cemented material at 24 to 40 inches. Southshore soils are well drained and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
