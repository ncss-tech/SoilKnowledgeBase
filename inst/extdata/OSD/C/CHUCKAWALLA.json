  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe soil is dry most of the time and is moist for less than 60 consecutive days from December through February.  The soil may become moist, from erratic summer thunder showers during July, August, or September, in the surface few inches but would rarely wet the moisture control section.\nSoil temperature: 72 degrees to 77 degrees F.\nSolum thickness:  10 to 30 inches\nVery gravelly or very cobbly alluvial soil material occurs at depths of 3 to 12 inches\nRock fragments:  averages 35 to 75 percent rock fragments\nThe surface has a strongly expressed desert pavement of gravel that are contiguous.  The upper side of the gravel have a well developed dark desert varnish (patina) of manganese and iron oxide; under side are tinted orange.\nDepth to calcic horizon: less than 20 inches, contains 15 to 25 calcium carbonate equivalent\nDepth to base of argillic horizon: less than 25 inches\nThe control section has an E.C. of 16 to 40 dS/m.  The soil is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nE horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 6 or 7 dry 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist\nTexture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam\nIt has weak to moderate, medium to thick platy structure; plates are dissected by gravel on the surface.\nCalcium carbonate: disseminated with effervescence being stronger on the flat surfaces of plates than on broken edges.\nThe lower boundary of the E horizon is very abrupt and smooth to irregular.\nBt horizon\nHue: 7.5YR, 5YR\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 4 or 6, dry or moist\nTexture:  loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon may be sandy clay but the average clay contact of the control section is 20 to 35 percent with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nRock fragments:  15 to 25 or more percent gravel in the upper part and 50 to 80 percent in the lower part.\nCalcium carbonate: mainly disseminated but are segregated into coatings, soft masses, concretions, or pellets in the lower part, some pedons are weakly cemented.\nCk horizon\nVery gravelly, extremely gravelly or very cobbly.  Sands, loamy sands, or sandy loams fill or partially fill the interstices larger than 2mm.\nCalcium carbonate: quite variable in each strata but are present as segregated coatings, soft masses, or concretions usually in the upper part, some strata are weakly cemented."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cololag (NV), Cristobal (AZ) and Pinamt (AZ) series.  Cololag soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Cristobal soils are greater than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon.  Pinamt soils are 25 to 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chuckawalla soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in stratified mixed gravelly alluvium.  They typically have a well developed desert pavement with a thick varnish (patina).  The climate is arid with very hot dry summers and cool slightly moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 7 inches (see remarks).  Most storms occur in the winter months but some rainfall occurs as erratic high intensity summer thundershowers.  There are also occasional severe wind and dust storms.  Elevation ranges 400 to 1,800 feet.  Mean January temperature is 53 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 92 degrees F.; mean annual air temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 240 to 350 days."
