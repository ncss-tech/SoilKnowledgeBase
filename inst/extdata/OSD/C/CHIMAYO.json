Slopes are 50 to 90 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 8,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

Atalaya soils are coarse-loamy over fragmental, have argillic horizons, and occur on beveled summits and shoulders of hills. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on backslopes of hills. Quapaw soils are loamy-skeletal, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent alluvial cones of hills."

(C horizons)\nLithic contact: at 17 inches. (R layer)\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 17 inches. (part of the C horizon)\nThe Bw horizon is not thick enough to qualify as a cambic horizon.\nThe 11/2006 revision moves the typical pedon to the pedon used in the update survey of the Santa Fe Area. The classification was also revised from loamy-skeletal, mixed, nonacid, mesic Lithic Ustorthents to fragmental, mixed, mesic Aridic Lithic Ustorthents. The series range in characteristics was re-written to comprise only the soils in the Santa Fe update survey. These soils were proposed in 1999 as the Sanctuario series, before being dropped and correlated with Chimayo in 2006.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
