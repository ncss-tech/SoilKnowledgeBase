  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedarlake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These soils are on shallow, closed depressions on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 482 millimeters (19 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland or wildlife habitat.  The natural plant community is a mixture of salt tolerant grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, and shrubs.  Vegetation includes alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, joint tail, sedge and rushes, inland saltgrass and occasionally some western wheatgrass.  Forbs include portulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs.  Woody species include salt cedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species.  In areas of standing water, cattails may be present.  The established plant community may fluctuate due mainly to the degree of salinity and the hydrology.  Vegetation is sparse in extremely saline areas.  This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (077CY689TX) range site in MLRA-77."
