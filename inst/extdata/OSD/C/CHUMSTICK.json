These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section average 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.  The average annual soil temperature is estimated to be 43 to 46 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.  The solum has 5 to 20 percent glass, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 1.0 and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.   The AB horizon is very stony ashy sandy loam, very cobbly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5, 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2, 3, or 4 dry or moist.  Texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam and is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, extremely cobbly, very stony or extremely stony or very cobbly."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist, gneiss, and granitic rock mixed with volcanic ash and loess.  Elevation is 1,500 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 32 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F; and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
