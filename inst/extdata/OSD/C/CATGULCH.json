  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Catgulch series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite or other coarse grained igneous rocks, gneiss or schist. These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
