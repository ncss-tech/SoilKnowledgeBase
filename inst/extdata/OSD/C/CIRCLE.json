The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts for 60 to 90 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 14 to 18 inches thick.  The ash mantle (A and 2B horizons 1 to 43 inches) contains 50 to 70 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 75 to 85 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 2.5 percent, and the 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 8 to 12 percent.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR moist and dry with value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.
