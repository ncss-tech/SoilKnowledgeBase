Loess typically is greater than 60 inches in thickness but, in some pedons, is as thin as 55 inches.  The particle-size control section averages between 35 and 42 percent clay and less than 7 percent sand.  Some pedons have one or more thin subhorizons that have as much as 45 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Clay content is 17 to 27 percent.  Sand content is less than 15 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Clay content is 17 to 27 percent.  Sand content is less than 15 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except the upper part ranges to moderately acid in some pedons that have been limed.\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon less than 3 inches in thickness between the Eg horizon and Btg horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox features have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Clay films have color value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Btg horizon typically is silty clay loam, but some subhorizons are silty clay, and the lower part is silt loam in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, and Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent and sand content is less than 7 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nIn pedons with less than 80 inches of loess, the 2Cg, 2Ab, and 2Btgb horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2,5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  These horizons or strata typically are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Color, texture, and thickness of these layers is quite variable.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cisne, Denny, and Smileyville series.  Cisne soils have more than 10 percent sand in the lower half of the series control section.  Denny soils are less acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Smileyville soils average more than 42 percent clay in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cowden soils are on broad, nearly level interfluves on the Illinoian till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in 55 to more than 80 inches of loess.  The material beneath the loess is Illinoian till or silty pedisediment often described as Roxanna silt or \"gritty loess\".  The till commonly contains a strongly developed paleosol.  Mean annual air temperature ranges  54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges  35 to 42 inches, frost-free period ranges 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges 400 to 700 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darmstadt, Ebbert, Fosterburg, Herrick, Oconee, Piasa, Pierron, and Virden soils.  Darmstadt, Herrick, and Oconee soils are somewhat poorly drained; have chroma of 3 or higher in the matrix in one or more subhorizons of the Bt horizon; and are on slight rises, convex summits, or sloping areas along drainageways.  Also, Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon and Herrick soils have a mollic epipedon.  Oconee soils form a hydrosequence with Cowden soils.  The poorly drained Ebbert, Fosterburg, and Virden soils have mollic epipedons; Ebbert soils are in depressions and Fosterburg and Virden soils are on broad summits on till plains similar to the Cowden soils.  Fosterburg soils also have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  The poorly drained Piasa soils have a natric horizon and are on broad summits intermingled with the Cowden soils.  The poorly drained Pierron soils are on similar landform positions as the Cowden soils but closer to the drainageways."

In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is 0.5 foot above the surface to 1 foot below from December to April in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The competing Denny series are differentiated from the Cowden series by differences in reaction and landscape setting.  These series are separated because of their unique statewide geographical occurrence, although reaction class overlaps at moderately acid and does not cause any major interpretive differences and landscape setting is not a recognized criterion for series differentiae.  Denny soils typically are in small closed depressions in the northern and central parts of the state, whereas Cowden soils are on broad till plains in the more highly weathered, thinner loess areas in the southern part of the state.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nochric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 19 inches (Ap, Eg1, and Eg2 horizons);\nalbic horizon - from a depth of 8 to 19 inches (Eg1 and Eg2 horizons);\nargillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 19 to 50 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons);\nabrupt textural change - from the Eg2 horizon to the Btg1 horizon;\naquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction, indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil;\nmesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
