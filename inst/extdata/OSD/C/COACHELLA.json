The soil is slightly to strongly effervescent and the lime is disseminated.  The organic matter is less than 0.75 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe Coachella soils are light olive gray fine sand and very fine sand with thin strata of silt loam or very fine sandy loam to a depth of 60 inches.\nThe profile has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand with thin strata (1/8 to 3/4 inches thick) of silt loam or very fine sandy loam."

Acolita soils have numerous lime concretions and organic matter that decreases regularly with depth.  Antho, Gilman, and Valencia soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Brios, Rositas, and Vint soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Myoma soils have a regular decrease in organic matter with depth."

The sediments are from dominantly igneous rocks.  The climate is arid with an annual precipitation of 2 to 4 inches that occurs as gently winter rains or as erratic high intensity summer storms.  The average January temperature is about 53 degrees F, average July temperature is about 92 degrees F and an average annual temperature of about 72 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 260 to 320 days."
