  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinasprings series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in vocanic ash influenced alluvium over volcanic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on alluvial fans, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
