    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and l2 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches thick. The particle-size control section is\ndominantly silt loam and contains 5 to 18 percent clay with less than l5 percent fine sand or coarser. The soil profile has a hue of l0YR or 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part and grades to slightly acid or neutral in the lower part.\nA Bw horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 clay, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is slightly acid to neutral. It has weak prismatic or weak to moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons have value of 3 through 6 moist or dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or sand with 2 to 15 percent clay and is commonly stratified.  The sandy loam, loamy sand or sand textures do not occur above a depths of 40 inches. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel. It has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive or single grain. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on flood plains at elevations of 30 to 800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Cloquato soils occur in a climate characterized by relatively cool dry summers and cool wet winters. Average annual precipitation is 38 to 70 inches. Average January temperature is 30 to 40 degrees F., average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The growing season (28F) ranges from 150 to 240 days."

Camas and Philchuck soils are on bar positions. Newberg soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick. Wapato soils are poorly drained and are in depressions on flood plains. Chapman soils are on higher flood plains. McBee soils are in depressions on flood plains."
