  "REVDATE": "07/2006",
  "STATES": "OR,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cloquato series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. Cloquato soils are on flood plains at elevations of 30 to 800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and l2 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches thick. The particle-size control section is\ndominantly silt loam and contains 5 to 18 percent clay with less than l5 percent fine sand or coarser. The soil profile has a hue of l0YR or 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part and grades to slightly acid or neutral in the lower part.\nA Bw horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 clay, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is slightly acid to neutral. It has weak prismatic or weak to moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons have value of 3 through 6 moist or dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or sand with 2 to 15 percent clay and is commonly stratified.  The sandy loam, loamy sand or sand textures do not occur above a depths of 40 inches. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel. It has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive or single grain. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid."
