    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cedonia soils are on outwash plains, relict glacial lake terraces and terrace breaks at elevations of 1,290 to 2,700 feet(394 to 823m). Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. They formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash mixed in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 11 to 25 inches (280 to 635mm). Average July temperature is about 68 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."

Brincken soils are on terraces, have a mollic epipedon and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Hunters soils have a mollic epipedon 25 to 50cm thick and are on terraces. Hodgson soils have more than 36 percent clay in an argillic horizon from 18 to 68cm and are on terraces. Lakesol soils are frigid, have a mollic epipedon 18 to 30cm thick, and are on terraces. Peone soils are in drainageways and have contemporary redoximorphic features within 50cm of the mineral soil surface."

The Bw horizons were revised to Bk horizons.  Additional investigation is needed as to the depth range to identifiable secondary carbonates although at this time presence is typically above 40 inches in Spokane, Stevens, North Ferry, and Colville Indian Reservation soil survey areas.\nClassification revised as of 5/2000 from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Xerochrepts to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nAdditional investigation is needed to this series concept in regards to the occurrence of a saturated zone above the substratum and the need for a revision of drainage class.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for this series.
