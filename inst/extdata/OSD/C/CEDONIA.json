  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Cedonia soils are on lake terraces and terrace breaks and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

They formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash mixed in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 11 to 25 inches (280 to 635mm). Average July temperature is about 68 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."

The Bw horizons were revised to Bk horizons.  Additional investigation is needed as to the depth range to identifiable secondary carbonates although at this time presence is typically above 40 inches in Spokane, Stevens, North Ferry, and Colville Indian Reservation soil survey areas.\nClassification revised as of 5/2000 from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Xerochrepts to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nAdditional investigation is needed to this series concept in regards to the occurrence of a saturated zone above the substratum and the need for a revision of drainage class.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for this series.
