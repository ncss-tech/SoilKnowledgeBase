  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Cald soils were formerly included in the concept of the Caldwell series.\nThe series was reclassified in 1/2000 from Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls to Aquic Cumulic Haploxerolls based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nThe type location was revisited and redescribed on September 28, 2007.  The series was reclassified in 1/2007 from Aquic Cumulic Haploxerolls to Typic Argiaquolls based on presence of redoximorphic features and aquic conditions within 20 inches and the presence of an argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 25 inches.\nAquic feature - the zone from 13 to 25 inches with chroma of 2 or less and redox concentrations.\nArgillic feature - the zone from 48 to 60 inches\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches\nCumulic feature - an assumed irregular decrease in organic carbon from 10 inches to 50 inches.\nUltic feature - bas saturation by sum is 75 percent or less in some part between 10 to 30 inches from the soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
