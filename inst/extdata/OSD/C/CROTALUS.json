  "OVERVIEW": "The Crotalus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from tuff modified by eolian material. Crotalus soils are on mountain flanks and bases. Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
