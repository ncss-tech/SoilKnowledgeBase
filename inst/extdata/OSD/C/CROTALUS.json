The Bascal soils have 5YR hue and discontinuities below 30 inches.\nBascom soils formed in Jurassic and Triassic redbed material and are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys and are more moist in May and June in the soil moisture control section.  Mule and Cienega soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  The Cienega soils are derived from limestone and have calcic horizon at depth of 10 to 20 inches.  The Mule soils contain 5 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section."
