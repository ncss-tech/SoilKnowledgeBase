Blappert soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section and are dominated by granitic rock fragments. Mulespring soils are 36 to 50 centimeters (14 to 20 inches) to the paralithic contact and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Rodad soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by channery siltstone and shale rock fragments. Vindicator soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominated by tuffaceous rock and pararock fragments."

Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,315 to 1,985 meters (4,310 to 6,500 feet). The climate is warm, arid with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran. The mean annual precipitation is 178 to 230 millimeters (7 to 9 inches); mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the frost-free period is 150 to 200 days."
