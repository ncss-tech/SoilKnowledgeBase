  "OVERVIEW": "The Cruzspring series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Cruzspring soils are on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
