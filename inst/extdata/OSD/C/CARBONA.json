  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbona soils lack slickensides that intersect in the 10 to 40 inch depth section.  COLE is 0.05 or more in a vertical section at least 20 inches thick beginning at the surface or at the base of the Ap.  Potential linear extensibility is at least 6 cm in the upper 60 inches of the soil profile.  When dry, cracks at least 1 cm wide and 12 inches long extend from the surface or the base of the Ap to depths of 20 or more inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 35 inches.  The soil between depths of 5 to 15 inches is dry in all parts from May through October and moist in all parts between late December and mid March.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Average clay content of the textural control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Soft sandstone is under some pedons at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nIn some pedons, the upper part of the A horizon has not been disturbed by tillage practices.  The A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2; 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 5/2, 4/2 and 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The lower part of this horizon has a higher clay content than the surface or the underlying horizon when the Bk is not present.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR 7/4, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, and 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, and 4/3.  It is clay loam, clay or gravelly clay loam.  Content of clay ranges from 27 to 45 percent.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 30 percent."

Deldota soils do not have secondary lime in the 10 to 20 inch zone, but they have disseminated carbonates in the lower part of the 10 to 20 inch zone or Bw horizon.  Zaca soils are calcareous throughout and are underlain by soft bedrock at depths of 40 to 65 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carbona soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent in gradient and are simple or complex.  Parent material is mixed alluvium from dominantly sedimentary, metasedimentary and igneous rocks.  Elevation ranges from 150 to 1500 feet.  The climate is semi-arid and with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 78 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."
