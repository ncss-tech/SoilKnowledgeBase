  "OVERVIEW": "The Crossplain series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift in swales and drainageways of uplands.  The soils have slow or moderately slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The depth to free calcium carbonate typically is 20 to 28 inches but ranges from 16 to 48 inches.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is clay loam, but is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Most pedons have faint mottling in the A horizon.\nAn AB horizon is in some pedons and has color of the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Some pedons have a thin Bt1 horizon that have less than 35 percent clay.  Typically, dark colored tongues from 1/2 to 2 inches wide extend into the Bt horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam or loam.  It has disseminated and common to many masses of calcium carbonate and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons visible nests of gypsum are in the lower part of the Bk horizon, but are generally below 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has disseminated and few to common masses of calcium carbonate and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Thin lenses of sandy loam or sand mixed with gravel are below depths of  40 inches in some pedons."

Bremer and Lodgepole soils contain less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser iin the particle-size control section.  In addition, Bremer soils are leached of carbonates to depths greater than 60 inches.  Gregory soils do not have secondary carbonate masses in the lower one-half of the series control section.  Taintor and Winterset soils are leached of carbonates to depths greater than 40 inches and contain less sand.  Worthenton soils are moderately or strongly alkaline in the argillic horizon."

Surfaces are plane to concave with slope gradients less than 2 percent.  Crossplain soils formed in glacial drift or a thin mantle of local alluvium over glacial drift.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches. Growing season is about 130 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation is 14 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2600 to 3400."

Clarno and Hand soils are on the higher parts of the landscape and do not have an argillic horizon and are better drained.  Davison and Harps soils are on low convex knolls adjacent to swales and have a calcic horizon.  Prosper and Whitewood soils are in swales.  Prosper soils have a fine-loamy control section and Whitewood soils have a fine-silty control section.  Tetonka and Worthing soils are in closed depressions.  Tetonka soils have an E horizon.  Worthing soils have a mollic epipedon more than 36 inches and are ponded for longer periods during the growing season."
