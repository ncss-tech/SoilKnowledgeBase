Birdow soils are calcareous to the soil surface and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Blackrock soils are well drained, contain 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and have a Bk horizon. Coit soils are poorly drained and calcareous throughout. Dagor soils have a xeric soil moisture regime, are well drained, and have a solum less than 26 inches thick. Eastcan soils are calcareous throughout, have a xeric soil moisture regime, and mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F. Goose Creek soils are calcareous in some part of the control section. Goosenawt soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F, are mildly or moderately alkaline, and do not have redoximorphic concentrations. Gosinta soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick. Heidtman soils have a calcareous horizon in the control section with SAR of 13 to 30. Lakeview soils do not have redoximorphic features, are somewhat poorly drained, have a solum less than 40 inches thick, and have 2Btb horizons. Monroe soils are well drained, are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the control section and do not have Bg horizons. Oxy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.
