  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 28 inches.  Reaction\nranges from medium acid to very strongly acid in the A and B2 horizons, except where limed, and from strongly acid to very\nstrongly acid in the Bx and B3 horizons.  Coarse fragments range\nfrom 0 to 10 percent in the A, B2, and Bx horizons and from 0 to\n25 percent in the B3 horizons.  Silt content is more than 30\npercent in the B2 and Bx horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and\nchroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  The Bx horizon is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and\ngray or it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of\n3 through 8 with common to many mottles of chroma 2 or less.\nPercent brittleness by volume ranges from 60 to about 90.  Texture\nis loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The B3 horizon has the\nsame hue, value, chroma, and texture range as the Bx horizon."

Prentiss soils have thicker fragipan horizons and have red mottles in the lower part of the fragipan horizon.  Stemley soils have more than\n15 percent by volume of chert fragments in the A, B2, and Bx horizons.  Dickson, Locust, Paden, Roane, and Wynnville soils have\na weighted average of 18 through 34 percent clay in their control sections.  Nixa soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments\nin its control section.  Sango soils have less than 15 percent\nsand coarser than very fine sand."
