  "OVERVIEW": "The Cayo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Holocene and Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are in interdunes on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",
