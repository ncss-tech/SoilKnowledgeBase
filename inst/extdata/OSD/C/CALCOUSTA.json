  "OVERVIEW": "The Calcousta series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments more than 1 meter thick in lake basins on till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
