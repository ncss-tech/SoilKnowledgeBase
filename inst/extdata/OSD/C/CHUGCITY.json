  "OVERVIEW": "The Chugcity series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and eolian material derived from  sandstone and siltstone.  Chugcity soils are on hillslopes and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Chugcity soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon is typically less than 20 inches, but ranges to 30 inches.  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or warmer,  but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nA Bw horizon is present in some pedons.  It has a similar range in characteristics as the A horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 30 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is typically slightly hard Brule siltstone."
