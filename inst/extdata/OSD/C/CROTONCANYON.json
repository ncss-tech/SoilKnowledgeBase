  "REVDATE": "07/2006",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crotoncanyon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, and residuum derived from cretaceous age Straight Cliffs Formation sandstone. Crotoncanyon soils are on hillslopes on structural benches.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
