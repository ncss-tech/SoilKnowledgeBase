Gilpin is among the most extensive series in MLRAs 124, 125, 126, and 127 and is mapped on a variety of geologic parent materials. The Clifftop series will be limited to soils formed in materials weathered from early Pennsylvanian Period geologic parent materials (members of the Pottsville Group or its analogue)."
