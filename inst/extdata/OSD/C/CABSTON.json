The Cabston soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from shales and sandstone.  The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 255 to 355 mm, most of which falls during spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 5.5 to 7.0 degrees C.  The growing season is 115 to 135 days."
