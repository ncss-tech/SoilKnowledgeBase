  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. AON/TDT",
  "REVDATE": "03/2006",
  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crutch series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash deposits weathered from andesite, basalt and other rocks of the Cascade Andesite Formation.  They are on stream terraces in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Thickness of the solum and the depth to the densic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry and a chroma of 1 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent gravel.  It is very strongly to strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 dry.  It is cobbly or very cobbly loamy coarse sand.  It is very strongly to strongly acid.  It has 5 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Some pedons contain firm aggregates. These aggregates along with the streak seen in the modal profile commonly have 5YR hues.\nThe BCs horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loamy coarse and or extremely cobbly coarse sand.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 20 to 35 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma dominantly of 2 but with variegations ranging from 1 through 4.  It is brittle, firm or very firm and is weakly consolidated.  It has 30 percent gravel, 30 to 50 percent cobbles and a few stones."
