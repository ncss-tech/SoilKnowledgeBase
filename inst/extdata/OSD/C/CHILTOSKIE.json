Rock fragment content is less than 35 percent in the upper 40 inches, and less than 60 percent below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. The A horizon thickness does not meet the criteria for an umbric epipedon.\nThe Bw horizon, and BA horizon where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has colors and textures similar the Bw horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chiltoskie soils are on gently sloping to very steep toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Slopes are commonly between 8 and 50 percent, but ranges from 2 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 4,500 to 6,400 feet. These soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, phyllite and slate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 60 to 100 inches. Moist atmospheric conditions are prevalent and fog is common in these high mountain areas."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anakeesta, Breakneck, Cataloochee , Guyot, Heintooga, Horsetrough, Luftee, Oconaluftee, and Pullback series.  Anakeesta, Breakneck, Cataloochee, Guyot, Luftee, Oconaluftee, and Pullback soils formed in residuum on adjacent mountain summits and side slopes. Anakeesta soils have a lithic contact between 40 to 60 inches. Breakneck and Luftee soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Cataloochee soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Guyot soils have a paralithic contact between 40 to 60 inches. Pullback soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Heintooga and Horsetrough soils formed in colluvium. Heintooga soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Horsetrough soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and are poorly drained."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is in forest. Common trees are northern red oak, black birch, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow buckeye, red spruce, and fraser fir. In many areas the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized. The understory species are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts,  pin cherry, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, silverbell, blueberry, wood sorrell, and flame azalea. Common forbs are hay-scented fern, wood fern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Chiltoskie series was formerly included with the Tanasee series. However, Tanasee soils formed in colluvium from high grade metamorphic and igneous rocks. Although Chiltoskie soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Oe and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 61 inches below the surface (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from NSSC-SSL samples S00NC-173-002 and S00NC-087-003.\nNASIS Site ID: 113905\nNASIS Pedon ID: 114743\nNASIS User Pedon ID: Chiltoskie OSD\nNASIS DMU ID: 410120\nMLRA = 130B\nRevised 02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
