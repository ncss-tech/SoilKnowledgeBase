  "OVERVIEW": "The Ciales series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on concave positions of foot slopes and lower side slopes of dissected mountains in the Caribbean National Forest. They formed in residuum from igneous rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 150 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 71 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.",
