  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section averages 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  These soils are saturated between 24 and 40 inches for more than 90 days during late winter and spring.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  The A2 commonly is fine sandy loam, and less commonly silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent pebbles. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Some pedons do not have an Ab horizon.\nSome pedons have a weakly expressed Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It commonly is stratified sandy loam and fine sandy loam, but the range includes silt loam and sand.  It is gravelly in some pedons.  It has 5 to 30 percent pebbles.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have an AC or AC' horizon."

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Garrison and Springdale soils are mesic and are on outwash terraces.  Hodgson and Kewach soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and are on lacustrine terraces.  Inkler and Spokane soils are well drained on steeper mountain slopes. Parmenter and Wapal soils are well and somewhat excessively drained respectively, on outwash terraces.  Ret soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are somewhat poorly drained.  Sanpoil soils have an aquic moisture regime and are poorly drained."
