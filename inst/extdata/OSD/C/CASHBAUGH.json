Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described October 4, 1979, the soil was dry throughout. About 20 percent of the soil surface is covered with gravel.\nA1--0 to 3 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent fine and medium gravel, neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)\nA2--3 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent fine and medium gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to tuffaceous sandstone or basalt bedrock is 15 to 50 cm.  The soil above the bedrock is usually dry from mid-May through mid-November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of time.  The soil temperature is above 5.0 degrees C. from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 15.  Summer and fall thunderstorms occur, but are sporadic and usually do not significantly wet the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C.  The soil surface is covered with 10 to 25 percent rock fragments. Aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3, and moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand with 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  Cobbles (bedrock fragments) are present in some areas and make up 0 to 3 percent of the soil volume.   Some of the rock fragments are pumice and obsidian.  Very stony phases are recognized with 25 percent stones and cobbles and texture of very stony loamy sand.  Organic carbon content is 0.4 to 0.5 percent.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent.  Rhyolitic volcanic ash makes up 40 to 60 percent of the soil by weight.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe R contact is considered lithic and usually has a horizontal cleavage."

They have formed in mixed alluvium and volcanic ash deposited on tuffaceous sandstone and basalt bedrock.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The elevation range is 1,955 to 2,290 meters.   The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, mostly as snow.  Mean annual snowfall is 60 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 0.6 degrees C; the mean July temperature is about 15.6 degrees C.  The mean annual temperature is 6.7 to 10.0 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
