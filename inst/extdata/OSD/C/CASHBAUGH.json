  "OVERVIEW": "The Cashbaugh series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils.  They formed in mixed alluvium and volcanic ash deposited on tuffaceous sandstone and basalt bedrock.  Cashbaugh soils are on nearly level to undulating volcanic tablelands, volcanic flows and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to tuffaceous sandstone or basalt bedrock is 15 to 50 cm.  The soil above the bedrock is usually dry from mid-May through mid-November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of time.  The soil temperature is above 5.0 degrees C. from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 15.  Summer and fall thunderstorms occur, but are sporadic and usually do not significantly wet the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C.  The soil surface is covered with 10 to 25 percent rock fragments. Aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3, and moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand with 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  Cobbles (bedrock fragments) are present in some areas and make up 0 to 3 percent of the soil volume.   Some of the rock fragments are pumice and obsidian.  Very stony phases are recognized with 25 percent stones and cobbles and texture of very stony loamy sand.  Organic carbon content is 0.4 to 0.5 percent.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent.  Rhyolitic volcanic ash makes up 40 to 60 percent of the soil by weight.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe R contact is considered lithic and usually has a horizontal cleavage."
