  "OVERVIEW": "The Cascade series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty materials.  Cascade soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The profiles are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for about 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to the fragipan range from 20 to 30 inches.  There is a perched water table over the fragipan during the winter.  The umbric epipedon ranges in thickness from 10 to 19 inches.  Very stony silty clay loam textures occur below 30 inches in some areas.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly or moderately acid throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 10 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe fragipan (Bx and Btx) has redox features and tongues with chroma of 2 or less and ranges from 2 to over 4 feet thick.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, firm or very firm and hard or very hard.  Clay films are few or common and faint or distinct on the fractures and in pores in the fragipan.  Few rock fragments of basalt are at or near the upper boundary of the fragipan.  In some areas a buried strong silty clay loam occurs below 30 inches."

Bornstedt soils have ochric epipedons and heavy silty clay loam B horizons and clayey fragipans with less than 35 percent base saturation.  Delena soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Goble soils have a udic moisture regime, have evidence of amorphous clays and are 30 to 45 inches deep to the fragipan.  Kinton soils have ochric epipedons and lack mottles above depth of 30 inches."

The soils formed in loess-like materials.  The climate is humid temperate with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean July temperature is 67 degrees F., mean January temperature is 39 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 60 inches.
