These soils are dry for more than half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 11 inches thick.  The particle-size control section contains 5 to 15 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments by weighted average.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is 10 to 30 percent pebbles, 5 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones and boulders.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and is very gravelly or very cobbly.  It is 25 to 45 percent pebbles and 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders."

Aldax, Bodell, Johntom, Limekiln, Rockly, and Venator soils have a xeric moisture regime.  In addition, Aldax soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F.  Bodell, Lickskillet, and Venator soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Bakeoven and Rockly soils are 4 to 10 inches to a lithic contact.  Limekiln soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of 7 to 12 inches.  Plaskett soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F.  Handap soils lack a cambic horizon and are calcareous throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Couleedam soils are on shoulders and backslopes of glacially-scoured foothills.  These soils formed in colluvium from quartz monzonite, granite, granodiorite, or gneiss with a small component of loess.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 800 to 2,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 73 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
