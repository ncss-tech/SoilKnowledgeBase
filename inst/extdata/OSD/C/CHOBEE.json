  "OVERVIEW": "The Chobee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, soils that formed in thick beds of loamy marine sediments. Chobee soils are on flatwoods in depressions, drainageways, low broad flats, and flood plains on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
