Cameo, Clarkelen, Radnik and Tapicito soils are well drained, do not have a fluctuating water table, and do not have redoximorphic features. Castledale soils are well drained and have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Charalito soils are well drained, have fragments of monzonite, gneiss and schist, and have 15 to 25 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Innacutt soils are somewhat excessively drained, do not have a fluctuating water table, and do not have redoximorphic features.  Glenberg soils are well drained and do nothave redoximorphic features.  Kornman soils have an over-thickened (10 to 20 inches thick) nitrogen and phosphate enriched man-made surface horizon resulting from applications of silty irrigation water over long periods of time.  Redbank soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder."

These soils formed in thick stratified alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., and average summer temperature ranges from 65 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 150 days."
