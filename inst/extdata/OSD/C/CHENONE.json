  "OVERVIEW": "The Chenone series consists of very deep, well drained soils on floodplain-steps.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1524 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
