    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 15 percent clay and 15 percent or more (by weight) of the particles are fine sand or coarser.  Depth to the ortstein layer is 20 to 30 inches.  Soil reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Few to common, distinct or prominent redox concentrations and redox depletions occur throughout this horizon.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent ortstein fragments.  Typically, this horizon has an accumulation of organic matter and a high content of fibrous roots.\nThe 2Bsm horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the soft matrix pockets, and 5YR or 7.5YR in the ortstein layer, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Few to common, distinct or prominent redox concentrations occur in the upper part of this horizon.  It is strongly cemented.  Textures are sandy clay loam, loam or sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent reddish brown (2 to 5 mm) iron cemented nodules.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.  It is variegated, stratified loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent clay and thin, intermittent lenses weakly cemented by iron and/or aluminum occurring to a depth of 10 feet or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cashner soils occur in nearly level to depressional or concave areas and narrow drainageways on broad tops of deeply dissected high marine terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured eolian material overlying stratified marine sediments.  Elevations are 400 to 1,500 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 300 days.  Cashner soils occur on the Griggs geomorphic surface."

Cunniff soils are on an adjacent lower marine terrace, have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Joeney soils are on an adjacent lower marine terrace, 10 to 20 inches deep to a cemented ortstein layer, and are poorly drained."
