  "OVERVIEW": "The Cashner series consists of moderately deep to an ortstein layer, poorly drained soils formed in medium textured eolian material overlying stratified marine sediments.  Cashner soils occur in nearly level to depressional or concave areas and narrow drainageways on broad tops of deeply dissected high marine terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 15 percent clay and 15 percent or more (by weight) of the particles are fine sand or coarser.  Depth to the ortstein layer is 20 to 30 inches.  Soil reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Few to common, distinct or prominent redox concentrations and redox depletions occur throughout this horizon.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent ortstein fragments.  Typically, this horizon has an accumulation of organic matter and a high content of fibrous roots.\nThe 2Bsm horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the soft matrix pockets, and 5YR or 7.5YR in the ortstein layer, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.

It has 0 to 30 percent reddish brown (2 to 5 mm) iron cemented nodules.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.  It is variegated, stratified loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent clay and thin, intermittent lenses weakly cemented by iron and/or aluminum occurring to a depth of 10 feet or more."
