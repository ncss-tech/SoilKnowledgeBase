  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates range from 10 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches and includes all or part of the Btn horizon.  The natric horizon has a SAR of 10 to 20.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam and is slightly acid or neutral.  The A and E horizons are usually mixed, when cultivated.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or clay averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkz and BCkz horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are clay loam or clay and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  They contain few to many, fine or medium masses of carbonates.  Few to many concentrations of visible salts or gypsum occur below 16 inches.  The horizons contain 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is clay loam, but is clay in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Visible salts and gypsum vary between pedons and range from few to common, fine or medium nests or threads.  It does not contain masses of carbonates in some pedons.  It contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the DeGrey, Dudley, Dwight, Farmsworth and Wood River soils.  DeGrey soils contain less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section.  Dudley and Farmsworth soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Dwight soils contain less sand in the control section, have a wetter soil moisture control section and have a soil temperature of more than 50 degrees F.  Wood River soils contain less sand and typically are leached of carbonates to greater depths."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cavo soils are on level to gently sloping till plains.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  They formed in glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 21 inches. Growing season is about 130 to 155 days; growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3200."

Demky soils do not have columnar structure and have tonguing of an albic horizon into the natric horizon.  Jerauld soils have visible salts within 16 inches of the surface.  Glenham, Oko and Raber soils do not have natric horizons and are on similar landscapes and adjacent uplands.  Hoven soils are poorly or very poorly drained and are in upland basins.  Onita soils do not have natric horizons and are on foot slopes."
