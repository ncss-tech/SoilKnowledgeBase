  "OVERVIEW": "The Cyclopic series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in alluvium from granite and basalt on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
