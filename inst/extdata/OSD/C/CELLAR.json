A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nThe type location of the typical pedon is the same pedon but a different location than the taxonomic unit description published in Yavapai County, Arizona, Western Part (AZ637).\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 12/08, WWJ.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
