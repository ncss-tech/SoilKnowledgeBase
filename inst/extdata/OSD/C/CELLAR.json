  "OVERVIEW": "The Cellar series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium from granitic rock.  Cellar soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nThe type location of the typical pedon is the same pedon but a different location than the taxonomic unit description published in Yavapai County, Arizona, Western Part (AZ637).\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 12/08, WWJ."
