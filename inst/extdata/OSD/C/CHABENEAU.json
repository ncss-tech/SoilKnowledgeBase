  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated the depth ranges in this paragraph are from the mineral soil surface.) Thickness of the silty or loamy eolian mantle ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 60 percent in the sandy lower horizons. Cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 10 percent in the sandy lower horizons. Stones range from 0 to 2 percent throughout.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures. Reaction of the A and E horizons ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Stratification is common. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid."
