Bartome, Bigfrog, Chuska, Dewar, Grassval, Pipeline, Roseworth, and Thoms soils lack bedrock above depth of 40 inches.  Argalt soils have bedrock at less than 20 inches.  Packwood soils typically have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches and they have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the B2t horizon.  Bruncan soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the Bkq horizon.  Chuckridge and Handpah soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Wellington soils have SL or SCL Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Colthorp soils are on basalt plains, terraces and on plug domes and lava flow lobes on lava plains and shield volcanoes.  Elevations range from 2,600 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash overlying basalt.  Winters are cool and moist and summers are hot and dry.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Average January temperature is about 28 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 73 degrees F.; average annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 100 to 160 days."

McCain and Power soils lack a duripan.  Sebree soils have a natric horizon.  These soils occupy landscape positions similar to the Colthorp soils."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
