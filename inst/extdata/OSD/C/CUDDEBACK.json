  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuddeback series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Cuddeback soils are on old terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan are 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 67 degrees F.  and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  The soil is moist in some part from November to March but is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.  The soil is dry continuously from April through October.  The solum is slightly saline.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The SAR is 2 to 10.\nThe A horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, or very pale brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4). Moist colors ar brown or yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4). The A1 horizon underlies the erosion pavement and gravel is well rounded or subangular and is from 3/8 to 5 inches in diameter.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand and averages 5 to 10 percent fine gravel.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish brown or yellowish red (5YR 5/4, 5/6) or infrequently, pink (7.5YR 7/4). Moist colors are reddish brown, yellowish red, reddish yellow (5YR 4/4, 5/6, 6/6) or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6). This horizon is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam and averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 10 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe duripan (Csicam) ranges in thickness from about 1 to 15 inches or more.  It is indurated and continuous and has 2 or 3 mm opal caps.  In pedons where it is thicker and can be dug with a backhoe, it shows laminae or tendency toward plates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cuddeback soils are on old terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  Elevations are 2,200 to 3,000 feet.  The gravel pavement ranges from moderately to strongly developed and covers from 40 to 90 percent of the soil surface.  The pebbles on the better developed pavements have desert varnish on their exposed surfaces.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool partly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 or 5 inches; most of the moisture falls as rain in the winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 255 days."
