    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than half the time. The depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 17 inches and may include part of the argillic horizon. Thickness of the volcanic ash and pumice mantle ranges from 7 to 16 inches. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 30 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 10 to 16 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Sand-size pumice content ranges from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Sand-size pumice ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Texture is a cobbly ashy fine sandy loam, very cobbly ashy fine sandy loam gravelly ashy fine sandy loam or very gravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has chroma of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Sand-size pumice ranges from 2 to 20 percent. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Corbaley soils are in drainageways of dissected uplands at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet. They formed in mixed alluvium of volcanic ash, loess, and pumice over basalt. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 16 inches, an argillic horizon from 9 to 16 inches and a lithic contact at 16 inches. The particle-size control section is the entire argillic horizon. There is 15 to 25 percent pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter with an estimated 30 to 60 percent glass throughout the profile. These soils would classify as Lithic Vitritorrandic Argixerolls if provided in Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
