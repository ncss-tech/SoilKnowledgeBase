  "OVERVIEW": "The Cedric series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on dissected bedrock floored plains, hills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
