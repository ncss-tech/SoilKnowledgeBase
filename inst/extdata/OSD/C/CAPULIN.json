  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Capulin series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum, derived from basalt.  These soils are on basalt capped mesas, fans, and lava plateaus. Slope ranges from  0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
