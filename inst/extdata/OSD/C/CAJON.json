There is weak stratification of sandy material in some or all parts.\nTypically the soil is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent throughout although some pedons are noneffervescent in the A horizon.\nTypically the profile is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline although some pedons are neutral.\nSome pedons are strongly alkaline and mildly saline-alkali to strongly saline-alkali. Electrical conductivity ranges up to 16 ds/m and the SAR to 20.\nThe A - Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 6 moist\nChroma: 2 through 6 dry and moist.\nTexture: Coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand and loamy sand. Some pedons have sandy loam overblown phases. Some pedons have as much as 60 percent gravel within 2 inches.\nThe C horizon - Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 6 moist\nChroma: 2 through 6 dry and moist\nTexture: Coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand or their gravelly or cobbly equivalents.  Some pedons have a sandy loam horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches."

Bluepoint soils are dominantly in hue of 5YR and have chroma of 3 through 6.  Brazito soils are not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for months following the summer solstice.  Carsitas and Myoma soils have a hyperthermic temperature regime.  Maynard Lake soils contain a significant amount of volcanic ash.  Moapa soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Pintura soils have hue of 5YR or redder and lack stratification. Toquop soils typically have hue redder than 10YR.  Yturbide soils are noncalcareous or have small amounts of disseminated lime.  Also, Yturbide soils are moist in the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cajon soils have gradients of 0 to 15 percent and are on recent fans, fan skirts, fan aprons, inset fans and river terraces at elevations of 200 to 4,300 feet.  The lower elevations commonly occur in the San Joaquin Valley.  They formed in sandy alluvium, mostly granitic rock sources, but also a variety of sources are included.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and somewhat moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 2 to 9 inches, mostly in the form of winter rain.  Mean January temperature is 43 degrees to 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 82 degrees to 84 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 70 degrees F. Frost-free season is 150 to 340 days."

Adelanto soils have an argillic horizon. Arizo soils have a sandy skeletal particle size control section. Calcio, Goldivide and Gravesumit soils have an argillic horizon and a calcic horiaon. Edalph and Hesperia soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Livefire soils have sandy loam textures within the particle size control section. Rosamond soils have a fine-loamy particlr size control section."
