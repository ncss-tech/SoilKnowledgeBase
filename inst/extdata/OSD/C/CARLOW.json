  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  These soils have deep wide cracks during dry seasons, usually the summer months.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silty clay but some pedons are silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid unless limed.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral. Iron masses have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. The particle size control section commonly is silty clay or clay, but may include individual horizons of silty clay loam. It averages between 45 and 60 percent clay. Thin clay depletions are present in the upper part in some pedons and shiny pressure faces are on faces of peds. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and slightly acid or neutral in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon, if present, is silty clay or clay with similar color and reaction to the lower part of the Bg horizon."

Humeston and Kampville soils contain less clay in the particle size control section and are on similar landscapes.  Kennebec and Nodaway soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent higher flood plains. Wabash have a mollic epipedon of 36 inches or more and are on similar landscapes."

Missouri Characterization Sample No. M9011708; diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 to 80 inches or more (Bg horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: In Iowa, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, White Cutgrasses, Fox Sedges, Oval Sedges, Inland Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Dark Green Bulrushes, Flatstem Spikerushes, Blue Vervains, Indian Hemps, Winged Loosestrifes, Wild Mints, and Water Horehounds.
