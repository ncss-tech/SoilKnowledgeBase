  "STATES": "KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chillicothe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in loess or loess and residuum from limestone or shale. These soils are on gently sloping ridgetops and upper side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 91 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Changed the 2Bt or 2BC horizon clay content from a high of 50 to a high of 60 based on recent NSSl data. Added gravels, cobbles and stones to the 2Bt horizon. The addition of the gravels, cobbles and stones reflects what is commonly present above the R horizon.\n09/2008 GJJ added some metric conversions, removed English units, and some format changes.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Missouri Characterization Laboratory Number M9411719.
