Changed the 2Bt or 2BC horizon clay content from a high of 50 to a high of 60 based on recent NSSl data. Added gravels, cobbles and stones to the 2Bt horizon. The addition of the gravels, cobbles and stones reflects what is commonly present above the R horizon.\n09/2008 GJJ added some metric conversions, removed English units, and some format changes.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Missouri Characterization Laboratory Number M9411719.
