  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Content of gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the Ap or A horizon; and content of gravel is from 0 to 15 percent in the Bw horizon and C horizon.  Below 40 inches, the gravel content can be as much as 25.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 (6 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.  The Ap horizon or A horizon commonly is loam or silt loam and less commonly sandy loam; fine sandy loam, or channery analogues of loam or silt loam.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Thin subhorizons in some pedons have value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.  The Bw horizon commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The average clay content of the control section is 18 to 30 percent.  The Bw horizon is medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6, and can have mottles of high or low chroma below a depth of 48 inches.  It commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly sandy loam and ranges from relatively uniform to highly stratified.  Some pedons have fine sand, loamy fine sand, or gravelly loam below a depth of 40 inches.  The C horizon is medium acid to neutral."

Sensabaugh soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Bermudian, Clifty, Cuba, Pope, and Sharon soils are more acid and have lower base saturation.  Eel and Lobdell soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the soil surface.  Genesee soils have carbonates within the control section.  Hamlin, Haymond, and Tioga soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Hartshorn soils are in the fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family.  Moshannon, Nolin, and Woodmere soils are in the fine-silty family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chagrin soils are on flood plains receiving alluvium mainly from upland areas of sandstone, siltstone, shale, limestone, and low-lime glacial drift.  They are typically in areas of Wisconsinan Age glaciation but also occur in unglaciated valleys. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 55 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Caneadea, Chili, Fitchville, Glenford, Holly, Lobdell, Orrville, and Wheeling soils.  Caneadea, Chili, Fitchville, Glenford, and Wheeling soils have argillic horizons and are on terraces of nearby landscapes; in addition, Caneadea, Fitchville, and Glenford soils formed in lacustrine sediments, and Chili and Wheeling soils formed in stratified outwash materials.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Holly soils, moderately well drained Lobdell soils, and somewhat poorly drained Orrville soils are in a toposequence with the well drained Chagrin soils.  Holly soils are in wet depressions, and Lobdell and Orrville soils are in intermediate landscape positions between Holly soils and the higher-lying Chagrin soils."
