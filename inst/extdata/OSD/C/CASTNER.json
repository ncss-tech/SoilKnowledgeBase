  "OVERVIEW": "The Castner series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone, argillite, quartzite or fine grained igneous rock. These soils are on hills, plains, escarpments, ridges, eroded fan remnants, scarp slopes, dip slopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
