  "OVERVIEW": "The Cowlitz series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in gravelly dredge material over mudflow or gravelly debris flow.  Cowlitz soils are on bottomlands, river terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 53 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments and 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nSome profiles contain woody organic debris.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist or dry. Textures are very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand."

Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Cowlitz soils formed in more than 5 feet of gravelly dredge material over mudflow from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 80 inches.  The average annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 175 to 240 days.  The frost-free period is 150 to 200 days."
