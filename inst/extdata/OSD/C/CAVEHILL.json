Granzan soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to bedrock. Highup and Ridgecrest soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Lonjon soils are typically neutral in the A horizon and have mollic epipedons that are 18 to 30 cm thick. Sylvaniam soils are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative during the summer due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cavehill soils are on hills, mountains, and rock pediments. They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, calcareous sandstone, and dolomite with surficial deposits of loess. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,646 to 2,987 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
