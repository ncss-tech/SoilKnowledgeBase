  "OVERVIEW": "The Cavehill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, calcareous sandstone, and dolomite with surficial deposits of loess. Cavehill soils are on hills, mountains, and rock pediments. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
