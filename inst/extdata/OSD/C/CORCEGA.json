    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the sands varies from 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to water table varies from 10 to 36 inches.\nColors of the A horizons have hues of 10YR and values of 3 and 4.\nThe B horizons have colors in hues of 10YR, values of 4 and chromas of 2 and 4.  The B horizons have few to common mottles of yellowish red, reddish brown, light gray and gray colors.  Structure of the B horizons ranges from weak fine to medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizons have colors in hues of 10YR and 2.5Y, values of 4 and chromas of 1 and 2 and mottles of reddish brown, yellowish brown and gray colors.  Silty clay loam is the dominant type.  These soils have slightly sticky and slightly plastic sola.  Reaction ranges from slightly to medium acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Maunabo, Vayas, Fortuna, Playa, Bajura, Santoni, Josefa, Talante, Coloso, and Pinones series.  The Maunabo and Fortuna soils are acid, lack the sandy C horizons, and are finer textured throughout.  The Playa, Bajura and Santoni soils are darker, finer textured, and have low chroma mottles higher in the profile.  The Josefa soils are more acid.  The Vayas soils are finer textured throughout and saline in the lower horizons.  The Coloso soils are finer textured and do not have sandy C horizons.  The Talante soils are more acid.  The Pinones soils have buried organic materials within 20 inches of the surface."

The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall is 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F.  Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is more than 71.6 degrees F. with less than 9 degrees F. difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature."
