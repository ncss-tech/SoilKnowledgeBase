  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Camocca series consists of very deep, poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils in shallow depressions between coastal dunes and on nearly level flats between dunes and marshes.  They formed in sandy sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A and C horizons is more than 80 inches.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately alkaline.  Shell fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Silt plus clay is less than 5 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThin buried horizons containing few to common pieces of undecomposed plant material are in some pedons.  They have hue of 10YR through 5Y or are neutral, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 0 through 2.  They are coarse sand, sand, or fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carteret, Dello, and Lang series in the same family.  Soils in a related family are the Duckston and Osier series.  Carteret soils are in salt marshes that are flooded twice daily.  Dello and Lang soils are at higher elevations in a dry climate with 10 to 20 inches of rainfall.  Duckston and Osier soils have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Camocca soils are mainly in shallow depressions between coastal dunes and on nearly level flats between the dunes and marshes generally at elevations below 10 feet.  Slopes are typically less than 2 percent.  Surfaces are plane to concave.  The soils formed in sandy sediments reworked by waves and wind.  Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The soils are periodically flooded with salt water.  Salinity is variable according to frequency of flooding."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arapahoe, Assateague, Chincoteague, Fisherman, Magotha, and Nimmo.  Arapahoe and Nimmo are on the nearby coastal plain and contain more clay.  Chincoteague and Magotha are on salt marshes and contain more clay.  Assateague and Fisherman soils are on vegetated dunes and are better drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; very rapid permeability; flooding is common and the soil is periodically inundated by storm tides."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Camocca soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and recreation.  Some areas support sparse stands of native pines and hardwoods.  The native plant community consists of waxmyrtle\n(Myrica cerifera), marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), greenbrier (Smilex spp.), eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia), and bigleaf sumpweed (Iva frutescens)."
