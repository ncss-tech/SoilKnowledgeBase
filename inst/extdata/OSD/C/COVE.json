  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  The soils are saturated for 4 to 6 months during the winter and spring unless drained, and remain moist below depth of 20 inches nearly continuously but are dry above this depth for 1 to 2 months during the summer.  During the summer the soil cracks at some depth above 20 inches, usually at depths between 7 and 20 inches.  The solum is 30 to 45 inches thick.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe surface layer generally has 10YR hue but ranges to 2.5Y.  The soil has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 or less throughout except that in the A horizon chroma may be as high as 3.  It is silty clay loam or clay.\nThe Bg horizon generally has 2.5Y or neutral hue but ranges to 5Y or 10YR.  It has value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations are at depths of less than 20 inches.  It is clay or silty clay and averages 50 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Cg horizon has color and texture similar to the Bg horizon."

Marna soils have secondary carbonates at 26 to 48 inches and glacial till at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Waldorf soils are 26 to 55 inches to secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cove soils are on flood plains and low tream terraces along both large and small streams at elevations of 100 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent and are plane to slightly concave.  The soils formed in deep clayey recent alluvium washed mainly from areas underlain by sedimentary and basic igneous rocks.  Winters are cool and moist, and summers are warm and dry.  The mean July temperature is 66 degrees F, and the mean January temperature is 37 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is typically 50 to 54 degrees F.  but may range to 56 degrees F. in the interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost-free period is 140 to 210 days.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 18 to 60 inches but ranges to 90 inches in the high winter rainfall interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon."

Dollar soils have a fragipan.  Hockinson soils have medium texture.  Labish soils have a black, organic A horizon and a dark fine-textured and nearly massive B horizon.  McBee soils are fine-silty and have chroma of 3 and have mottles below depths of 20 inches.  Wapato soils are fine-silty."
