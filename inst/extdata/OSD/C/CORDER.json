  "OVERVIEW": "The Corder series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent on plains. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
