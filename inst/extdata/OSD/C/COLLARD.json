The solum (A and Bt horizons) above the very cobbly loamy sand is 17 to 40 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is brown or dark brown and has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or extremely stony silt loam with 20 to 65 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from brown to dark brown.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam or very cobbly clay loam with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments. The Bt horizon has organic carbon content of less than 0.58 percent and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.
