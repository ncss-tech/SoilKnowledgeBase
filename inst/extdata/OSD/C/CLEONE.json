The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.
