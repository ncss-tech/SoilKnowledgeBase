    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F, (16 to 18 degrees C).  The soil between depths of 8 and 25 inches, (20 to 64 cm) is moist in some or all parts from late October to late May or June and is dry in all parts the remainder of the year, unless irrigated.  The 10 to 40 inches, (25 to 102 cm) particle-size control section is stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand and averages 10 to 18 percent clay, when mixed, and has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Up to 35 percent gravel may occur below a depth of 40 inches, (102 cm).  Redoximorphic features occur between 10 and 48 inches, (25 to 122 cm).  Content of organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3 or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3 or 4/2.  Texture is sandy loam, sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam and commonly is stratified.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 8/4, 8/1, 7/4, 7/3, 7/2, 7/1, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2 6/1, 5/4 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 7/2, 6/2, 6/4, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1,  3/3, or 3/4.  Redoximorphic features have hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR with chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Texture is stratified sand to silty clay loam.  Finer textures occur below 40 inches, (102 cm).  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline but may be moderately alkaline in horizons underlain by an Ab horizon.\nThe Ab horizon is 10YR 6/1, 5/1, 4/1, 4/2, 3/1 or 2/1; 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, 2/1; N 2/0; 2.5Y 3/2.  Texture is mucky clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Depth to a buried horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches, (102 to 152 cm).  Some pedons lack a buried horizon and some pedons are calcareous at 40 inches, (102 cm) or more.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Columbia soils are on flood plains with bar and channel topography in some natural areas or are on natural levees.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevations are 10 feet below sea level to 155 feet above sea level (47 m).  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches, (304 to 635 mm).  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F, (7 degrees C), mean July temperature is 80 degrees F, (27 degrees C).  Mean annual temperature varies from 58 to 63 degrees F, (14 to 17 degrees C).  Frost-free period is 230 to 340 days."

Arvin soils are not saturated with water within 60 inches, (152 cm) of the surface and are in similar or slightly higher flood plain positions.  Clear Lake and Sacramento soils have clay textures and are in basins.  Sycamore soils have less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and are in similar flood plain positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; negligible to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  Clay substratum phase has slow permeability below a depth of 40 inches, (102 cm).  Sandy substratum phase has rapid permeability below a depth of 40 inches, (102 cm).  Except where drained, these soils are saturated at 20 to 48 inches, (51 to 122 cm) for several months in the period from November to April.  In areas not protected by levees or other flood control structures these soils are subject to occasional to frequent, brief to long periods of flooding in November to May.  Rare flooding occurs in partly protected areas."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated hay, small grain, and orchard and row crops.  Vegetation consists of a fairly dense cover of oaks, cottonwoods, willows, vines, shrubs and grasses near stream channels, but more open away from the channels."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was redefined in the Chico area of Butte County, California in 1925.  The type location was moved to Madera County, Californiain 1959.  The type location was then moved to Solano County, California 1970.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 16 inches, (41 cm) (Ap, A)\nOxyaquic subgroup - the zone from 20 to 48 inches, (51 to 122 cm) is saturated for several months.\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area and University Laboratory data.\nEdit log: Runoff terminology adjusted 4/96 to adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual (10/93). 5/2003 Proposed edits for use in Butte County; Range in Characteristics: expand allowed gravel from 5 to 35 percent below a depth of 40 inches.  A horizon: add textures sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, and add: commonly is stratified.  C horizon: add colors moist 10YR 6/2 and 3/4.  Geographic setting: expand elevation from 150 to 155 feet.  In remarks added history of type location moves.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NO: 50-CAL-20-39-1-1 to 3 University of California, Madera County, Tehama County, and UC Berkley, 58-52-48.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
