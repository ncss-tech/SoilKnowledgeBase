  "OVERVIEW": "The Colibro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in erosional calcareous loamy material of Quaternerary age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on ancient alluvial terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
