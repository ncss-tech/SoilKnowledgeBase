  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 48 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. A few pebbles are in some pedons. Redox depletions are within a depth of 7 to 16 inches and deeper. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout, unless limed, but pedons that are stratified may range to neutral below 40 inches. Some pedons have buried horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry value is 6 or 7. Undisturbed areas have an A horizon 1 to 7 inches thick, that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam. They have weak to strong, fine to medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have platy structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have a BCg horizon below 20 inches with a chroma of 2. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak fine or medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. In some pedons below a depth of 40 inches there are layers or stata ranging from silt loam to fine gravel with colors similar to the C horizon but range to 7.5YR in some pedons. It is massive or single grain, depending upon texture. Consistence ranges from loose to friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cornish soils are on flood plains that are commonly in broad depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in alluvial deposits of very fine sand and silt. Flooding frequency ranges from twice annually to once in 10 years. Overflow generally occurs during spring runoff and during heavy rains. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 48 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 10 to 3000 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Lovewell soils, and the Adams, Allagash, Charles, Colton, Croghan, Duxbury, Fryeburg, Madawaska and Sunday soils. Adams, Allagash, Colton, Croghan, Duxbury, and Madawaska soils are better drained soils on adjacent outwash plains, deltas and terraces. Charles soils are wetter and in lower positions on flood plains. Fryeburg and Sunday soils are better drained and in higher positions on flood plains."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The Cornish series replaces some soils formerly mapped Winooski and Limerick that are somewhat poorly drained and have a frigid temperature regime.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 24 inches (Bw horizon).\nc. Fluvaquentic feature - content of organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth redox depletions are within 24 inches of the mineral soil surface (Bw horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 145, July 1991.\nSoil interpretation record numbers for the Cornish series are: Cornish, ME0079; and Cornish, stratified substratum, ME0119.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
