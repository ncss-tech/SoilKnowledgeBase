Bodine soils are formed in chert and are typically more brown. Octavia and Ruston soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Panama soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower solum. Saffell and Zafra soils have sola less than 60 inches thick."

They formed in loamy colluvium derived from material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 56 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 degrees to 60 degrees F. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 64 to 78."
