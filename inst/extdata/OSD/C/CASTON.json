  "STATES": "AR,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caston series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable, stony soils that formed in loamy colluvium. The colluvium is derived from material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale of Carboniferous age. These soils are on colluvial benches, foot slopes, and coves in the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 50 inches. Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F.",
