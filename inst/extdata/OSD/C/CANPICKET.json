  "OVERVIEW": "The Canpicket series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff.  Canpicket soils are on mountain summits, shoulders and side slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
