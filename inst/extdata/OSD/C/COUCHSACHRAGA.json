  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 10 inches from the mineral soil surface. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout the solum. Stones and boulders cover from .01 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to very strongly acid in the surface and subsurface horizons, and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the subsoil.\nThe O horizons have hue of 10R to 10YR or are neutral, with value and chroma of 3 or less. It is fibric, hemic, or sapric material. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure, or is single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose.\nThe Bhs horizons and Bh horizons (where present), have hue of 10R to 7.5YR or, with value and chroma of 3 or less. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse granular or subangular blocky structure, or are single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose. It is moderately or strongly smeary.\nBedrock is anorthositic gneiss (metamorphosed anorthosite)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Couchsachraga soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of mountains and ridges at elevations greater than 3000 feet. Slope ranges from 15 to 80 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of sandy material over bedrock. In some pedons this mantle is till, and in most pedons it is residuum derived from the underlying anorthositic gneiss bedrock. In very steep areas the mineral soil material is colluvium from unstable upslope positions. The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 80 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 110 days. Elevations range from 3000 to 5400 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Skylight series and the Esther, Ricker, Santanoni, and Wallface soils. Skylight soils occupy similar landscape positions and have mineral soil horizons 10 to 20 inches thick over bedrock. Ricker soils are thin organic soils on landforms similar to those of Couchsachraga soils. Esther and Wallface soils occupy less sloping, more stable parts of the landscape, are coarse-loamy, and are very deep and moderately deep to bedrock respectively. Santanoni soils are also on similar topographic positions, but have mineral soil horizons 20 to 40 inches thick over bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some pedons have enough andic soil properties to key out as Andic Humicryods if they did not key out as Lithic first, and some pedons lacking E horizons will key out as Lithic Haplocryands. These are similar soils in use and management to the Lithic Humicryods concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Spodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 9 inches (Bhs horizon).\nb. Humic feature - more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.\nc. Lithic feature - bedrock at 9 inches from the soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons:\nS93-NY-031-005, S93-NY-031-009, S93-NY-031-012, S94-NY-031-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
