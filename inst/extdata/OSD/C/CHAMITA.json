  "OVERVIEW": "The Chamita series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale, sandstone and metamorphic rock.  Chamita soils are on flood plains, valley floors and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
