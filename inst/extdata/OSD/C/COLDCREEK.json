  "OVERVIEW": "The Coldcreek series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from argillite and quartzite.  Coldcreek soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 46 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F. when lacking an O horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E2 horizon is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe E/Bt horizon ranges from neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bt part has hue usually of 10YR or 7.5YR and ranging to 5YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 3 or 4.
