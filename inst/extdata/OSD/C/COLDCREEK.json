The E2 horizon is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe E/Bt horizon ranges from neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bt part has hue usually of 10YR or 7.5YR and ranging to 5YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam and has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, mainly of pebbles and cobbles and lesser amounts of stones."
