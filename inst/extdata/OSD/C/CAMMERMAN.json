  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Cammerman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and/or residuum weathered from metamorphic bedrock. Cammerman soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about l4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F (16.7 degrees C).",
