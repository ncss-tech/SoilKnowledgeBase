  "OVERVIEW": "The Crex series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits on outwash plains or lake plains. Permeability is rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches. The particle-size control section averages 50 percent or more fine sand. Rock fragments are absent throughout the pedon. Depth to carbonates is greater than 80 inches. Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Redox accumulations and saturation occur within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 to 3 and chroma is 0 to 2. The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sand or sand. Some pedons have strata of loamy fine sand."

Pelkie soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth and are on flood plains and subject to flooding. Tourtillotte soils average less than 50 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section and are underlain by stratified lacustrine deposits in the lower part of the series control section."
