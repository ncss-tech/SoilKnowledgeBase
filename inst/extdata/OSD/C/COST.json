Brundage and Casa Grande soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Crot and Gothard soils are in the thermic family.  Dietrich and Willamar soils have clay content of more than 20 percent throughout the subsoil.  Imogene soils have darker surfaces and less saturation with sodium in the upper 40 inches.  Orelia soils have Bt horizons that have less than 15 percent saturation with sodium.  Palobio soils have sola 60 to more than 80 inches and have less sodium saturation."

Slopes are dominantly plain or slightly concave and are mostly less than 1 percent but range to 2 percent.  The soils formed in saline, stratified sandy and loamy sediments presumed to be alluvium of Pleistocene age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free days ranges from 260 to 300 and elevation ranges from 200 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 48."
