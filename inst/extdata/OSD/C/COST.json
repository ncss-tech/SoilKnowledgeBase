Brundage and Casa Grande soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Crot and Gothard soils are in the thermic family.  Dietrich and Willamar soils have clay content of more than 20 percent throughout the subsoil.  Imogene soils have darker surfaces and less saturation with sodium in the upper 40 inches.  Orelia soils have Bt horizons that have less than 15 percent saturation with sodium.  Palobio soils have sola 60 to more than 80 inches and have less sodium saturation."
