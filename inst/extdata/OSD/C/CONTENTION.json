These soils formed in gypsiferous and calcereous alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes (lacustrine deposits).   The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 260 days."
