  "OVERVIEW": "The Crunker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on inset fans and fan aprons.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
