  "OVERVIEW": "The Chesuncook series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains, hills, ridges, and mountains. These soils formed in dense glacial till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum, and low to moderately high in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm at the type location.",

The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments are mainly gravel, with stones and cobbles ranging from 0 to 20 percent throughout the mineral soil. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Redoximorphic features are deeper than 41 centimeters from the mineral soil surface.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Mineral solum thickness was narrowed with revision, 10/08, to ensure single family placement. The competing series section was revised accordingly. It is recognized that in historic correlation, some pedons now have a shallow depth class. This could done through MLRA update.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 3 centimeters (Oa horizon).\n2. Albic horizon - the zone from 3 to 10 centimeters (E horizon).\n3. Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 27 centimeters (Bhs and Bs1 horizons).\n4. Cambic horizon - the zone from 27 to 53 centimeters (Bs and BC horizons).\n5. Densic contact - very firm, dense till at a depth of 21 inches.\n6. Aquic Conditions - redoximorphic features at 42 centimeters below the mineral soil surface."
