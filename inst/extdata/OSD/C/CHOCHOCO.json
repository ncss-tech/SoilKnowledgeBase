  "OVERVIEW": "The Chochoco series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over basalt colluvium and residuum. Chochoco soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters (33 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
