    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to very gravelly sand is 26 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 67 degrees F. Individual strata may have from 15 to 35 percent gravel or cobbles but the control section when mixed contains from 35 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble. The fine earth is typically a sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist; chroma of 2 or 3. It is typically gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Cca horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR. Textures are very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam with some strata of gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. Lime content is 20 to 40 percent. Content of coarse fragments range from 20 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe IIC horizon has textures of very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, and extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 45 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cambarge soils are on nearly level and gently sloping old terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium that mantles cobble, gravel, and sand. Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches that occurs mainly in the winter and spring. The mean annual temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 50 degrees to 66 degrees F. The frostfree season is about 100 days."

Native vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, shadscale, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, and thickspike wheatgrass. Some minor areas are in irrigated cropland and are in urban development. They are also used extensively as a source of gravel."
