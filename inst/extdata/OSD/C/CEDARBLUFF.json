    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 66 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to strongly acid in the Ap horizon and is strongly acid throughout the B horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4, with few to many mottles in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8 with common to many mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.\nThe Btx1 and Btx2 horizons are mottled gray, yellowish brown, and yellow.  The clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from about 18 to 35 percent and more than 20 percent silt.  Texture of the Bt horizons is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have clay textures below 40 inches.  The Btx1 and Btx2 horizons restrict roots in the compact brown and yellow portions which comprise about 40 to 60 percent of the horizontal area."
