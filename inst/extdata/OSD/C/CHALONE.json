  "OVERVIEW": "The Chalone series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from acidic volcanic breccia. The Chalone soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 35 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",
