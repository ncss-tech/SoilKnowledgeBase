  "REVDATE": "03/2005",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Camaguey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on foot slopes.  They formed in fine-textured sediments that weathered from limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 84 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Camaguey soils have cracks that open and close more than once during the year but do not remain open for more than 90 cumulative days during the year.  Gilgai relief is common in pastures.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the A horizons and are moderately alkaline in the Bss horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 and 3, and chroma of less than 2.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray range from few to many.  It has slight to violent effervescence with dilute HCL.  Texture is clay."
