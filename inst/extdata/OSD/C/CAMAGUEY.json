  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Camaguey soils have cracks that open and close more than once during the year but do not remain open for more than 90 cumulative days during the year.  Gilgai relief is common in pastures.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the A horizons and are moderately alkaline in the Bss horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 and 3, and chroma of less than 2.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray range from few to many.  It has slight to violent effervescence with dilute HCL.  Texture is clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Camaguey soils are on foot slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  They formed in regolith consisting of fine-textured sediments that weathered from limestone.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 88 inches and the average annual temperatures ranges from 77 to 79 degrees F."

Colinas soils have coarse-loamy control sections, are moderately deep to limestone, and are Mollisols.  Naranjo soils are calcareous and are Mollisols.  Santa Clara soils have mixed mineralogy and are moderately deep to limestone."
