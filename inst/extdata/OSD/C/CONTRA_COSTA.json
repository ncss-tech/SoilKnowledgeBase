  "OVERVIEW": "The Contra Costa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from shale and sandstone.  These soils are on foothills and mountains that have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to sandstone and shale is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 57 to 68 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time. The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry from June until October or early November and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Rock fragments make up 2 to 45 percent of the soil volume. Fragments are mostly rounded gravels in the surface and mostly sandstone or shale in the horizon above the bedrock.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid (pH 6.0) and either remains constant or is slightly more acid with increasing depth.  The surface 5 inches has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe A horizon has 10YR and 7.5YR hue, with value of 4, 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Textures are loam or clay loam. The A horizon has granular structure or the soil is massive and hard when dry.\nThe Bt horizon is reddish brown to brown in 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR hue with value of 4 through 6, 3, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 2, 3, 4 to 6 moist. Textures are clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.\nA transitional horizon commonly occurs between the Bt horizon and bedrock with texture similar to the Bt horizon except sandstone and shale fragments increase up to about 35 percent.  In some pedons the sandstone and shale bedrock is strongly weathered in the upper 4 inches of the rock."

Argonaut soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Fancher soils formed in residuum from serpentine and have Ca/Mg ratios of 2:1 or less.  Trabuco soils lack a lithic or paralithic contact within depth of 40 inches."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature is 42 degrees F; average July temperature is 75 degrees F; average annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 185 to 290 days."

Dibble soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have B2t horizons with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Gaviota, Millsholm and Montara soils have lithic contacts at depths of less than 20 inches."
