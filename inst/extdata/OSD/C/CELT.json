  "OVERVIEW": "The Celt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have a fragipan at a depth of 20 to 36 inches.  These soils formed in loess or silty colluvium and the underlying cherty residuum on uplands.  Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Coarse fragment content by volume is less than 10 percent in the A and upper B horizons, 0 to about 15 percent in the Bt horizon above the fragipan, and 15 to 85 percent in the fragipan.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where present, the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The A and E horizons are very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Iron depletions with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less are present in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  The lower Bt horizon is mottled with shades of gray, brown, and red.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2Bx horizon is mottled.  It is gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam or silty clay loam and is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.

They formed in a thin mantle of loess or silt colluvium and the underlying residuum from cherty limestone or dolomite.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."

Lebanon soils are adjacent to Celt soils and on more rounded ridgetops. Bado and Gerald soils have an aquic moisture regime and are above the Celt soils on ridgetops or in depressional areas.  Hobson and Viraton soils have less clay and are below the Celt soils.  Wilderness soils have less clay and more coarse fragments and are below the Celt soils."
