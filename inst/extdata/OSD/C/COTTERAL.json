  "OVERVIEW": "The Cotteral series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slightly weathered pumiceous cinders and volcanic ash.  Cotteral soils are on mountainous uplands at elevations of 2,800 to 4,900 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 42 degrees to 44 degrees F. and the mean annual soil temperature where there is an 0 horizon is about 45 degrees F.  The upper part of the 10- to 40-inch control section contains 50 to 90 percent volcanic pumice that ranges from 2 to 50 mm in size.  The lower part of the control section is silt loam to sandy loam texture.  The thickness of the cindery mantle over the medial buried horizon ranges from 18 to 37 inches.  These soils are usually moist.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bs horizons have value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 7 dry in the upper part.  It is very cindery or extremely cindery, sandy loam, or sand in the upper part grading to cinders.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe underlying 2Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry. It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and contains 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments.  Some pedons have a 2Ab or 2Eb horizon.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."
