Dime, Nickel, and Stagecoach soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Railroad soils have bedrock at 30 to 40 inches.  Piquin soils are inactive.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chamberino soils are on piedmonts and fan terraces.   They formed in calcareous gravelly deposits derived mostly from andesite, dacite, latite, and rhyolite.  Annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches and the annual temperature is 58 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.  Elevation is 2,500 to 6,000 feet.   In Texas the frost-free period is as long as 240 days and the average annual precipitation is as much as 11 inches."

In addition, the Berino, Bucklebar, Dona Ana, and Tres Hermanos soils have argillic horizons and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Delnorte soils are shallow or very shallow to a petrocalcic horizon."
