  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cobbsfork soils are on broad level summits of loess covered till plains. Typically, undisturbed areas have a surface morphometry of micro highs and micro lows. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in 191 to 244 cm (75 to 96 inches) of loess and the underlying paleosol in Illinois age glacial till, (Sangamon age paleosol). The upper 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess averages about 15 percent sand, and the lower loess averages about 24 percent. This lower loess has been called \"gritty loess\". Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 107 to 305 meters (350 to 1000 feet)."

The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg soils, and the moderately well drained Nabb soils are on summits and shoulders between the broad areas of Cobbsfork soils. The well drained Bonnell and Hickory soils, and the moderately well drained Blocher and Cincinnati soils are on backslopes."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. In undrained areas, this soil has a surface morphometry of micro-highs and micro-lows. The potential for surface water runoff on the micro-highs is low and negligible in the micro-lows. In undrained areas, the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 feet) below the surface in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow above the horizon with fragic soil properties and is slow or very slow in and below the horizon with fragic soil properties."

    "content": "REMARKS: An undrained phase is recognized. The type location was investigated in 1995. A glossic horizon is recognized, and the classification was changed to a Glossaqualf. Also adjustments and additions were made to the typical pedon description. In future updates, the Cobbsfork series will be correlated for the Clermont series in Indiana. Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 41 gives more information on the parent materials of the Cobbsfork and geographically associated soils. The 2Btx horizon meets the brittleness criteria for a fragipan but not the structure criteria.\nThe representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 124491.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from 0 to 46 cm (18 inches) (Ap and EBg horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from 46 to 229 cm (18 to 90 inches) (Btg, Btg/Eg, 2Eg/Btgx, 2Btx, 3Btb horizons).\nFragic soil properties: from 97 to 216 cm (38 to 85 inches) (2Eg/Btgx, 2Btx horizons).\nGlossic horizon: from 69 to 127 cm (27 to 50 inches) (Btg/Eg, 2Eg/Btgx horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: present from 0 to 229 cm (90 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No. 174, file no.
