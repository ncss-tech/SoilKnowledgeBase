  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments are mostly pebbles and cobbles and range from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and from 0 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to  4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nA thin E horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have thin layers of loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Structure is massive or weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Colrain soils are on level to very steep glaciated uplands.  They are on broad plains and on the tops and side slopes of mountains, hills, ridges, and knolls.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in loamy glacial till derived mainly from interbedded siliceous limestone and mica schist.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buckland, Cabot, Peacham, Stowe, Tunbridge, and Westminster soils.  The moderately well drained Buckland soils, poorly drained Cabot soils and very poorly drained Peacham soils are in a drainage sequence with the Colrain soils.  Stowe soils are on similar landscapes and have densic materials in the substratum.  Tunbridge and Woodstock soils are on bedrock controlled landforms.  Tunbridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock and Westminster soils are shallow to bedrock."

Areas that have been cleared of stones and are being farmed are used mainly for hayland and pasture.  A small acreage of corn is grown for silage."

Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 13 inches (Bw  horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data is available for the following pedons: S59VT-9-5 (SSIR 20); S59VT-9-6 (SSIR 20)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
