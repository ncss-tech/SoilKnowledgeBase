  "OVERVIEW": "The Comobabi series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in fan alluvium and eolian deposits.  Comobabi soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 5 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

The soils have formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources and eolian deposits.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Average annual precipitation is from 5 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rains.  The average annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 260 to 320 days."
