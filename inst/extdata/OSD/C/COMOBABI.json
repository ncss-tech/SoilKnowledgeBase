    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Comobabi soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,200 to 2,100 feet.  The soils have formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources and eolian deposits.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Average annual precipitation is from 5 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rains.  The average annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 260 to 320 days."
