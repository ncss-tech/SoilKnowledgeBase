  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically, these soils are calcareous throughout.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Faint mottles of high chroma can occur at any depth, and distinct or prominent mottles with hues of 5Y or N occur at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is stratified in the lower part but when averaged is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Strata at both finer and coarser textures are present.  The soil is subject to frequent flooding from March through July.  A stagnant, fluctuating water table occurs at depths of 20 to 40 inches from May to September.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 moist, 2 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  EC is 4 to 8 mmhos.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR, values of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chromas of 2 through 4.  Textures, when mixed, are sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam averaging 5 to 18 percent clay.  They are stratified with thin lenses of finer and coarser textures.  Very gravelly sand strata can occur below 40 inches.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  EC is 2 to 8 mmhos."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Countryman soils formed in calcareous alluvium derived dominantly from sandstones and siltstones on flood plains and in drainageways.  Slopes are smooth with a gradient of 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 6,200 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The frost-free season is estimated to be 90 to 120 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."

Absher, Bosler, Ryan Park, and Tisworth are on more stable terrace positions.  Bosler and Ryan Park soils have argillic horizons.  Iceslew soils are finer textured.  Zeona soils are psamments and occur on sand dunes."
