  "OVERVIEW": "The Callahan series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in claystone interbedded with thin sandstone strata. These soils are on gently to strongly sloping ridges on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
