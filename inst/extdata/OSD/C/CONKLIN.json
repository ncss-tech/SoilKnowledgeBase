    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Conklin soils are on linear to slightly convex positions on stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 18 to 100 meters. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influenceand cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 2500 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
