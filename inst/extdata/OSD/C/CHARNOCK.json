  "OVERVIEW": "The Charnock series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Charnock soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
