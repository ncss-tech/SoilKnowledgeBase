  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Formerly part of the Rucker series that included both typic aridic and ustic aridic soil moisture regimes.  The type location for Comoro was moved in 1981 to a typic aridic area in Graham County, Arizona.  The Comoro concept has a long history of use and familiarity to ranching, research and soil survey.  It is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  This historical use has prompted us to structure the series as close to the original concept as possible and necessitates moving the type location to a ustic aridic (12 - 16 inch pz) soil moisture regime with a change in classification.  Rucker soils have a limited extent and will reflect a typic aridic (<12 inch pz) moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nEntisol feature - the absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999."
