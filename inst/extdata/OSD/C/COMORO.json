San Jose soils have soil temperatures of about 58 to 62 degrees F., hue redder than 7.5YR from the influence of red sandstone and shale, and occur on the Great Plains as part of MLRA 70.  Ubik soils are loam, very fine sandy loam and silt loam in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Comoro soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.   Elevations range from 2,200 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in stratified alluvium from predominantly granite and rhyolite sources.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 160 to 240 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Formerly part of the Rucker series that included both typic aridic and ustic aridic soil moisture regimes.  The type location for Comoro was moved in 1981 to a typic aridic area in Graham County, Arizona.  The Comoro concept has a long history of use and familiarity to ranching, research and soil survey.  It is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  This historical use has prompted us to structure the series as close to the original concept as possible and necessitates moving the type location to a ustic aridic (12 - 16 inch pz) soil moisture regime with a change in classification.  Rucker soils have a limited extent and will reflect a typic aridic (<12 inch pz) moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nEntisol feature - the absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
