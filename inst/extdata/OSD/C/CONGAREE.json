  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock commonly is more than 10 feet.  The soil is very strongly acid to neutral throughout but some part of the control section has a pH of 5.5 or higher.  Thin strata of contrasting textures are in the C horizon.  Most pedons have few to many flakes of mica.  Content of coarse fragments commonly is less than 2 percent by volume.  Content of organic matter is erratic with depth and buried horizons commonly below a depths of 24 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where the value is less than 3.5, and A or Ap horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon, to a depth of 20 inches or more, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in some pedons.  Below a depth of 20 inches to a depth of about 50 inches, colors are similar to the upper part of the C horizon; however, some pedons range to a hue of 2.5Y, and may have mottles of chroma 2 or less.  Below about 50 inches, the color ranges from brown to gray, commonly with contrasting mottles.  Texture of the particle-size control section is silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or loam commonly with strata of coarser or finer material. Below a depth of 40 inches, the texture is variable, ranging from loamy sand to silty clay."

Similar soils in other families are the Bunyan, Cascilla, Dela, Morganfield, Neubert, Norwood, Ochlockonee, Riverview, Robinsonville, Starr, and Toccoa series.  Bunyan soils are neutral to alkaline in some part of the 10 to 40 inch control section. Cascilla, Morganfield, and Norwood soils have less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Neubert soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Dela, Ochlockonee, Robinsonville, and Toccoa soils contain 8 to 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Riverview soils are more acid and have a cambic horizon.  Starr soils have a dark red to strong brown cambic horizon."

Cartecay soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section and they have mottles of 2 or lower chroma within 24 inches of the surface.
