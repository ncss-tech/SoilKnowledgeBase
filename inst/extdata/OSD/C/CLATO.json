    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 7 and 20 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Sandy strata are present below  a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It has an assumed irregular decrease in organic carbon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clato soils are on floodplains and low terraces at elevations of 30 to 300 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary and basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average January temperature is 38 degrees F., the average July temperature is 64 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The average growing season (28 degrees F.) is 215 to 240 days.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches."

The principal native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western redcedar, red alder, bigleaf maple, and black cottonwood with an understory of vine maple, Oregon-grape, trailing blackberry, salal, western swordfern, and western brackenfern."
