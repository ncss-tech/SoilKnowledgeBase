These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 14 to 24 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has 3 to 8 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent roc fragments  Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw1 and Bw2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  They are ashy loam, ashy silt loam, gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam, or gravelly ashy loam.  They have 0 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Codylake soils are on backslopes and ridges of mountains.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from quartz monzonite, granodiorite, or granitic rock.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches, with snow pack from December to March.  The mean January temperature is about 20 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."

Centralpeak, Moscow and Moses soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  In addition, Centralpeak and Moscow soils have a frigid temperature regime.  Manley and Togo soils are loamy-skeletal in the lower part of the control section.  Resner soils are sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the control section."
