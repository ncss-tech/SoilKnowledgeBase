Luta soils do not have an argillic horizon. Takpochao soils are clayey-skeletal and do not have pockets of soils that extend below a depth of 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chinen soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus that are often tilted and dissected.  They formed in sediments that are probably a mixture of residuum and volcanic ash, and overlie porous limestone that was part of a coral reef complex.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 30 to 1,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter. Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."

Chacha, Kagman, and Saipan soils are all deep and very deep.  Dandan soils are dominantly between 20 and 40 inches deep.  Takpachao soils do not have pockets of soil that extend below a depth of 20 inches, and have rock outcrop within the pedon.  DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow to medium.
