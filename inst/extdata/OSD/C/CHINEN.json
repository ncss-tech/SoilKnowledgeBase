  "OVERVIEW": "The Chinen series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils over limestone bedrock.  They are on uplifted limestone plateaus and formed in sediments overlying porous limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 87 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

They formed in sediments that are probably a mixture of residuum and volcanic ash, and overlie porous limestone that was part of a coral reef complex.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 30 to 1,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter. Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."
