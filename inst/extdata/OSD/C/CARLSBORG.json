  "OVERVIEW": "The Carlsborg series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in coarse textured alluvium.  These soils are on river terraces and old alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The soils have less than 5 percent volcanic glass.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry.  It is very gravelly loamy sand or very cobbly loamy sand.  In noncultivated areas, the upper part of the B horizon is very gravelly sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam in some pedons.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand or cobbly sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

Atter soils are dry for over 90 consecutive days and have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 59 degrees F.  Hoypus soils have 35 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles in the control section and less than 10 percent are cobbles.  Hoypus soils also have a thin E horizon that is absent in some pedons.  Choop and Lazan soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Valcreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Spens soils lack a B horizon and have a solum that is less than 10 inches thick."

Alderwood soils have a cemented layer at 20 to 40 inches.  Cassolary soils are fine-loamy.  Clallam soils are loamy-skeletal with a densic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Dungeness soils are coarse-silty.  Everett soils have a cambic horizon.  Kitsap soils are fine-silty.  Puget soils are fine silty and poorly drained.  Sequim soils have a mollic epipedon.  Yeary soils are fine-loamy with a densic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
