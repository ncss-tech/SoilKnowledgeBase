  "OVERVIEW": "The Canyonview series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks. The Canyonview soils are on mountain slopes, glacial valley walls, colluvial aprons, talus slopes, and moraines of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 780 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
