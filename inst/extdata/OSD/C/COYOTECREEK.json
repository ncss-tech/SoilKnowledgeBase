  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 64 to 67 degrees F.  The soil between 5 and 16 inches is dry in most years from early June to mid-October and is moist in all or some part the remainder of the time.  Weighted average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section is 18 to 27 percent with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  This soil has weak stratification.  Commonly, organic carbon content decreases regularly with depth and remains above 0.3 percent at 50 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to more than 40 inches thick and has 2 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Ap and A horizons are 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent and texture is loam or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe AC or C horizon, where present is 10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, or 4/4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."

The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  The climate is Mediterranean with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F., mean July temperature is 77 degree F. and the mean annual temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 230 to 275 days."
