  "OVERVIEW": "The Collinsville series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained, soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone of Pennsylvania age on interfluves and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1015 mm (40 inches) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
