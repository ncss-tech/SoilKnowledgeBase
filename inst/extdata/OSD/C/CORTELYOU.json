  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is less than 60 inches.  The seasonal high water table fluctuates from 18 to 30 inches from the surface.  Content of gravel ranges from non to as much as 10 percent of the volume throughout the profile. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is Loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4to 6, and chroma of 2 to4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and red range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red and gray range from few to many.  Texture is commonly fine sandy loam or sandy loam but may contain thin strata of sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 3 or 8. Many pedons have no dominant color and are multicolored in shades of yellow, brown and gray. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red and gray range from few to many. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand; some pedons have pockets or thin strata of fine sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family. Closely related soils include Bonnerdale, Harleston and Nansemond soils. The somewhat poorly drained Bonnerdale soils formed in weakly cemented tilted shale with thin strata of interbedded sandstone in the Quachita Mountain uplands in Arkansas.  Harleston soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches.  Nansemond soils are in non-flooding marine terraces in Virginia and South Carolina and receive considerably less rainfall than Cortelyou soils.  They have a subactive cation exchange activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cortelyou soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and old levees in the Southern Coastal Plain that are subject to flooding.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy fluvial sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches."

The well drained Benndale and moderately well drained Savannah soils are in slightly higher positions and are not subject to flooding.  The poorly drained Bibb and Johnston soils are on lower flood plain positions. The poorly drained Daleville and Smithton soils are on slightly lower positions on lower terrace levels."
