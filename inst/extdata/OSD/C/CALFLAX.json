    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Unless irrigated, the soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually not moist in some or all parts for as long as 70 to 90 consecutive days. It is usually dry from March or April to December or January.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F. and the temperature is always above 47 degrees F. The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent below the A horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. It is saline-sodic in a horizon at least 10 inches thick, within 40 inches of the soil surface, for a period of at least one month. Irrigation, drainage, and reclamation practices have an effect on the salinity, sodicity and gypsum content of this soil.\nThe A horizon has color of 2.5Y 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4. Moist color is 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4. Organic matter content is 0.5 to 2 percent. Clay content is 27 to 40 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 2 percent. Gypsum content is 0 to 3 percent. Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 12. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has color of 2.5Y 6/4 or 5/4. Moist color is 2.5Y 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4. Organic matter content is 0.3 to 1 percent. Clay content is 27 to 40 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 3 percent. Gypsum content is 0 to 3 percent. Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 20. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bny and Bnyz horizons have color of 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4 or 7/4. Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4. Organic matter is 0.1 to 0.4 percent. Texture is loam, silt loam or clay loam. Clay content is 18 to 35 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 3 percent. Gypsum content is 2 to 5 percent. Most of the gypsum in this soil has been applied during saline-sodic reclamation practices. Gypsum has been translocated in the profile by pedogenic and anthropogenic processes. In some pedons, the \"y\" subscript is absent because little gypsum has been applied.  Electrical conductivity is 2 to 16 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 13 to 40. Redoximorphic concentrations, when present, have moist color of 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8 or 6/6. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free season is 230 to 270 days."

Ciervo and Tranquillity soils, on fan skirts, have a fine particle-size control section. Cerini soils, on alluvial fans, are highly stratified and are not saline-sodic. Panoche soils, on alluvial fans, have an organic matter content that decreases regularly with increasing depth. Lethent soils, on fan remnants, have a natric horizon and a fine particle-size control section. Posochanet soils, on fan skirts, have a fine-silty particle size control section."

Many pedons have a transient perched water table at a depth of 4 to 6 feet that is influenced by irrigation. The high water table has a direct impact on the salinity and sodicity of the soil. Drainage and reclamation practices have an effect on the depth to the water table and salinity. This soil is subject to changes in depth to the water table and salinity of the soil."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously mapped as Panoche series in the Soil Survey of the Mendota Area, California, Series 1940, No. 18. When described in 1982, the typical pedon did not have a high water table within 6 feet of the soil surface. Subsequently this area developed a water table as high as 4 feet that necessitated a change in the mapping. The typical pedon is now mapped as Calflax clay loam, saline-sodic, wet. The typical pedon description is typical of these soils before they develop a high water table.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization samples for other pedons  S87CA-019-002 (4105-4110) and S94CA-019-002 (taxadjunct, 2029-2038) from the Fresno County, California, Western Part Soil Survey were analyzed by the NSSl, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
