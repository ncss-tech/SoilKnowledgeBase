  "OVERVIEW": "The Caphealy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on rolling uplands and hills.  They formed in coarse-textured colluvium over semi-consolidated sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 38 inches and is underlain by hard bedrock.  The soil contains about 10 to 25 percent pumice sand throughout the profile.  The soil is usually dry and is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days (cumulative) after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The profile contains 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Phosphate retention is 10 to 20 percent.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half the acid oxalate iron is 0.10 to 0.40 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 10 percent clay and 55 to 70 percent sand.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 4 moist.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 4 moist.  It contains 15 to 35 percent gravel.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline and has secondary carbonate accumulation in the form of coatings on rock fragments and free lime in the soil matrix."
