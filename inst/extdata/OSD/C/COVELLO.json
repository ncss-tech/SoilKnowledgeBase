  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean soil temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days in summer and autumn of most years.  The Ap and C horizons have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The 10- to 40-inch control section contains about 14 to 18 percent clay, and has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Below depth of 40 inches, the A horizon is very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  Except where drained, there is a permanent water table in the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cloquato, Hermiston, Mondovi, Onyx, Pasco, Pedigo, and Powder series.  Pasco soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches, and the upper three feet of Pedigo soils are strongly alkaline and calcareous.  All the other competing series lack a water table.  In addition, Cloquato soils are neutral to medium acid, and Mondovi and Onyx soils are free of lime above a depth of 43 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level bottom lands along streams, at an elevation of 1,200 to 2,100 feet.  The soils are frequently flooded when streams are high.  They formed in alluvium consisting mainly of loess and volcanic ash.  Summers are hot and dry, and winters are cool and moist.  Annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches.  Average January temperature is 32 degrees F., average July temperature is 71 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F."

Athena and Palouse soils have a cambic horizon, and occupy upland positions.  Patit Creek soils have more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the control section."
