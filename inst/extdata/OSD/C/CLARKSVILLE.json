  "OVERVIEW": "The Clarksville series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum from cherty dolomite or cherty limestone on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches, and mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F.",
