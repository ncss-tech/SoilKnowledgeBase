The soils formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum from cherty dolomite or cherty limestone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

Captina, Hobson, Lebanon, Nixa, and Wilderness soils have fragipans and are on higher broad, nearly level to gently sloping ridgetops.  Noark soils are clayey-skeletal and Poyner soils are loamy- skeletal over clayey.  These soils are on similar landscape positions."
