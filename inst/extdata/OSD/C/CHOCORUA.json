  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic soil layers ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  The organic materials are composed of herbaceous and woody materials.  Slightly decomposed woody fragments comprise 0 to 15 percent by volume of the organic materials.  Thin layers of live sphagnum moss up to 4 inches in thickness commonly occur on the surface.  The 0i and 0e layers are neutral or have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR with value and chroma of 0 to 4.  The value and/or chroma may increase 1 or 2 units when exposed to air.  Reaction of the organic layers is extremely acid.\nThe surface tier, exclusive of loose surface litter or moss, is comprised of hemic or fibric material with an unrubbed fiber content that ranges from 40 to 80 percent of the organic volume.  Rubbed fiber content ranges from 15 to 60 percent.  It has weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular structure, or is massive.  Consistence is nonsticky or slightly sticky.\nThe unrubbed fiber content of the subsurface tier ranges from 35 to 75 percent and the rubbed fiber from 15 to 35 percent.  The subsurface tier is dominantly massive or has platy structure.  The consistence is nonsticky or slightly sticky.\nThe organic bottom tier, where present, has the same range as the subsurface tier.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Textures include coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and range from 0 to 40 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The consistence of wet soil is nonsticky and nonplastic."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  The Cathro, Dawson, Greenwood, Ossipee, Tacoosh and Togus soils are similar soils in related families.  All of these soils except Togus are from outside of Region R.  Togus soils are dominated by fibric material and are less acid. Cathro and Dawson soils are dominated by sapric materials; in addition, Cathro soils are less acid.  The thickness of organic materials of Greenwood soils exceeds 51 inches. Ossipee soils have a finer textured mineral substratum.  Tacoosh soils are less acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS:  Chocorua soils occur in depressional areas within outwash and lake plains and on glacial till uplands.  The average range in size of these soil areas is from about 5 acres to 75 acres.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 47 degrees F."
