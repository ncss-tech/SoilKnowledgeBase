  "OVERVIEW": "The Cabezon series consists of shallow, moderately slowly to slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material over residuum derived from basalt.  The Cabezon soils are on lava plateaus.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabezon soils are on summits of lava plateaus and mesas. Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 8,100 feet. Slopes range mostly from 1 to 5 percent but range up to 15 percent. These soils formed in residuum from basalt that in places has been influenced by thin deposits of eolian material. The annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches and the annual temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The frost free period is 100 to 135 days."

All these soils lack bedrock within depth of 20 inches. Also, Friana and McGaffey soils have pachic and cumulic epipedons respectively and Osoridge soils lack mollic epipedons."
