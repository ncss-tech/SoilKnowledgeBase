  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to hard sandstone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches and may be extremely variable within short distances.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction, and includes very gravelly, cobbly, stony, very stony, extremely stony, and bouldery analogs. Content of coarse fragments of sandstone ranges from 35 to 80 percent by volume. About 35 to 50 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 25 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow. Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction, and includes very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, stony, very stony, extremely stony, and bouldery analogs. Content of fragments of sandstone ranges from 35 to 75 percent by volume. About 35 to 50 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 25 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction ranges from slightly acid\nto very strongly acid.\nThe R layer is grayish, yellowish, or brownish sandstone that is hard, massive, fractured and tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal."

Bengal, Carnasaw, Denman, Honobia, Nashoba, Pirum, Stapp, Sobol, and Zafra soils are on sideslopes below Clebit soils. Panama and Sherwood soils are on footslopes. Pickens and Tuskahoma soils are on the same landscape as Clebit soils."
