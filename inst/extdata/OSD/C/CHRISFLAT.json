Bullvaro, Demner, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback soils have lithic contacts between 40 and 80 inches from the soil surface and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Dogbed soils have mollic epipedons that are 30 to 50 inches thick.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Krenka soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Murain soils are dominated by stones and cobbles and average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Snyderville soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 36 inches.  Softback soils average 25 to 32 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that do not include the upper Bt horizons.  Softscrabble soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and typically have paralithic contacts between 60 and 80 inches from the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chrisflat soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks such as granodiorite and andesite and metamorphic rocks such as schist and gneiss.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
