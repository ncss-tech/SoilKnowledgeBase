    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the Btg horizon in some pedons.  Organic matter content decreases irregular with depth.  Depth to a paralithic contact in shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Redox concentrations are throughout, commonly as iron and manganese masses lining root channels and pores.  The particle size control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A, and/or AB horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Btg and/or BA horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 1 or 2.  Sand content averages more than 7 percent.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section has properties as follows: the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 1 or 2.  Rock fragment content  ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The 2Cr horizon is shale bedrock."
