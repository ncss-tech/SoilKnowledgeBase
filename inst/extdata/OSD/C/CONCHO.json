  "OVERVIEW": "The Concho series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Concho soils are on valley floors and drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
