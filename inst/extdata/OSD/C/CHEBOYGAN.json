  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cheboygan soils are on moraines, drumlins, lake terraces, and till plains. These soils are often found on uplands and post glacial lake islands. Slope gradients range from 0 to 50 percent, but are dominantly 2 to 30 percent. Cheboygan soils formed in sandy deposits and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the Blue Lake, Charlevoix, East Lake, Emmet, Mancelona, and Rubicon soils. The well drained Blue Lake and excessively drained Rubicon soils are formed in adjacent sandy sediments. The Charlevoix soils are somewhat poorly drained and are lower on the landform than the Cheboygan soils. Associated Emmet soils have slightly finer textures and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat excessively drained East Lake and Mancelona soils have more coarse fragments and less clay in the substratum and are on uplands and lake terraces closely associated with moraines."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained or moderately well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope gradient and depth to dense till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy material and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper sandy material and very slow in the lower loamy horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Cheboygan soil is in woodland. Forest vegetation consists mainly of sugar maple, American basswood, American beech, and white ash; with many areas having quaking aspen, white birch, and white pine. A large portion of the steeper areas are kept in permanent forest vegetation with a few areas used as pasture. Many nearly level to moderately sloping areas are used for pasture and growing hay and small grains. These crops include corn, oats, barley, and legume-grass hay."
