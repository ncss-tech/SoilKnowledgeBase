  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chocktoot soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from andesite, basalt, tuff, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 6,300 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 34 inches, the mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 20 to 50 days."
