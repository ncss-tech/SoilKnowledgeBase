    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 70 percent. The silty sediments contain 0 to 5 percent gravel and the underlying till contains 1 to 15 percent gravel by volume. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Free carbonates are absent within a depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is commonly silt loam, but includes very fine sandy loam or loam high in very fine sand. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E/B or B/E horizon has the same color and texture ranges as the Eg and Bt horizons. The Eg part makes up more than 15 percent of the horizon. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2B/E horizon with colors and textures similar to the 2Bt and Eg horizons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with properties similar to the 2BCd, but the bulk density is less.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.0 gm/cc. It is moderately acid to slighlty alkaline."

The poorly and very poorly drained Capitola, the somewhat poorly drained Magnor, and the moderately well drained Freeon soils form the hydrosequence with Cebana soils in Wisconsin. Adolph and Capitola soils are on slightly lower or similar landscape positions. Magnor, Brennyville, Freeon, and Milaca soils are on higher lying positions."

Poorly drained phases have perched saturation at depths of 0 to 1 feet at some time during the months March to June and October to November in normal years.  Very poorly drained phases have perched saturation at the surface at some time during the months March to June and October to November in normal years."

Aquic condition (suborder) based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha-alpha dipyridyl at some time during the year in 6 out of 10 years.\nThis red parent material does not produce reduced soil colors typical of other parent materials.  Redoximorphic features in the E horizon are used as field indicators to soil saturation. Mollic subgroup based on dark colors of the Ap horizon.\nThe dense till has repetitive fracturing that affects water movement and root penetration.\nThis soil was previously included with a poorly drained phase of Adolph.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
