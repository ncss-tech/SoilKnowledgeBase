  "OVERVIEW": "The Copperbasin series consists of very deep soils with sand and gravel at shallow depths.  They are somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  The Copperbasin soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid over very rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
