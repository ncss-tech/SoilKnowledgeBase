  "OVERVIEW": "The Camptown series consists of very deep, very poorly drained and ponded soils. These soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are in long and narrow relict stream meander channels and depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).",

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the ponded phase of the Evadale series.  The classification was changed from a Typic Glossaqualfs to Natric Vermaqualfs during the correlation of the MLRA 152B update.  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory from Hardin County,TX (S96TX-199-006) show exchangeable sodium percentages of 8 and higher in the Eg horizon.  Pedon descriptions throughout MLRA 152B and a reexamination at the series type location indicate more than 50 percent crawfish bioturbation in some portion of the profile within 100 cm (40 in) in depth.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 20 to 70 cm (8 to 28 in).  (Btg/E1 and Btg/E2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 13 to 20 cm (5 to 8 in)(Bg horizon)\nGlossic horizon: 20 to 102 cm (8 to 40 in) (Btg/E1, Btg/E2, and Btg/E3 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in) (Btg/E horizons, Btg and Bt horizons)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S96TX-199-006 from a representative pedon in Hardin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory exists from laboratory number S96TX-199-006 for a representative pedon in Hardin County, Texas.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
