  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chen soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite, tuff, basalt, quartz latite, quartz monzonite, chert, sedimentary rocks, and some loess high in volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,580 to 2,930 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Mosquet soils are clayey, have argillic horizons broken by hard bedrock, and have cryic temperature regime. Pie Creek soils are very-fine, moderately deep lithic contacts, and have an abrupt increases in clay at the upper boundary of the argillic horizons. Ramires soils are fine, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Taylor Creek soils are very-fine, very deep, and have cryic temperature regime."
