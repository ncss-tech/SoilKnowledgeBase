Silicate clay ranges from 35 to 50\npercent.  The soils are calcareous throughout and weighted calcium carbonate equivalent of the control section ranges from 25 to 40 percent.  Visible soft lime ranges from 5 to 20 percent of the\nmass at depths of 30 to more than 50 inches.  Pebbles of quartz\nless than 3/4 inch in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent.\nPressure faces and small shiny wedge-shaped peds are common.\nThe A horizon is dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3), dark brown\n(7.5YR 4/2, 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe B2 horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4),\nyellowish red (5YR 5/6), dark brown (7.5YR 4/4), brown (7.5YR\n5/4), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6),\ngrayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), and yellow (10YR 7/6).  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.\nThe Cca horizon is light brownish gray, grayish brown, or pale\nbrown and is generally mottled with few to many mottles of brown, very pale brown, yellow, and brownish yellow.  It is loam or clay loam."

Austin, Bolar, and Rowena soils have a solum\nthickness of less than 40 inches.  In addition, Austin soils have\na paralithic contact to chalk and Bolar soils have fine-loamy\ncontrol sections.  Denton soils have a lithic contact to hard limestone.  Engle, Sunev, and Venus soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Knippa soils are drier for longer periods of time and\nhave warmer soil temperatures.  Krum soils have less than 25\npercent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section and\nhave montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Lewisville and Quanah soils\nhave fine-silty control sections.  Nuvalde soils lack vertic properties."
