  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chilson soils occur on hilly exposures of the Moenkopi formation at elevations ranging from 6,800 to 7,500 feet, under a coniferous forest cover.  The soils are formed from calcareous shale, basalt and fine-grained sandstone.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches, the mean annual air temperature is approximately 44 degrees F. with a mean monthly temperature in January of approximately 28 degrees F. and in July of 57 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature of the soil is approximately 50 degrees F.  Slopes range from 20 to 45 percent with rock outcrops common on the slopes above 30 percent.  Frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
