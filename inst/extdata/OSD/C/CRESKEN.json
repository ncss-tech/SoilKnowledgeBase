  "OVERVIEW": "The Cresken series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the surficial sediments and moderately slow in the glacial till.  Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The friable, loamy upper material ranges from 12 to 25 inches in thickness.  A stone line or pebble band typically is at the lower boundary.\nThe Ap horizon typically is black (10YR 2/1) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  The A horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap and A horizons typically are clay loam but are loam in some pedons.  The A horizon ranges from neutral to medium acid.  An AB horizon is in some pedons.\nThe BA horizon is brown (10YR 4/3), dark brown (10YR 3/3), or, less commonly, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It typically is clay loam, but the lower part ranges to include thin layers of sandy loam near the glacial till boundary.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The part of the 2Bw horizon below about 25 inches has continuous grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) or light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) coatings on faces of peds.  Mottles in the 2Bw horizon are few or common and have hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8.  The 2Bw horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Clay content of the 2Bw horizon typically is about 30 to 32 percent but ranges from 28 to 33 percent.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons commonly have a mottled matrix with hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8.  Reaction in the 2BC and 2C horizons ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline."

Arbor soils lack the very firm consistence and the grayish coatings on faces of peds in the 2B horizon.  Aredale soils are friable in the 2B horizon and formed in a thicker layer of loamy sediments over the glacial till.  Bode soils formed in glacial or lacustrine sediments overlying till and contain more clay and less sand in the A horizon.  Clarion and Garmore soils have a solum formed entirely in glacial till, have a more friable B horizon, and lack the two story materials of the Cresken soils.  Everly soils have carbonates at shallower depths and have a thinner solum.  Farrar soils have lower clay and higher sand content in the A horizon and upper part of the B horizon.  Frontenac soils have channery loam 2C horizons within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Kenyon soils lack the very firm consistence and the continuous grayish coatings on faces of peds in the 2B horizons and typically contain less clay in the 2B horizon.  Liscomb soils typically average less than 27 percent clay in the B horizon.  Moland soils typically contain more silt in the A horizon and upper part of the B horizon and have a friable or very friable, less acid 2B horizon dominated by light olive brown colors.  Ocheyedan soils lack a solum formed in two story materials, lack gravel size and coarser materials in the solum, and have a friable B horizon.  Ostrander soils are friable or very friable in the lower part of the 2B horizon, are more stratified in the lower part of the 2B horizon and lack mottles having chroma of 2 or less within depths of 40 inches.  Rossfield soils have residuum from limestone within a depth of 40 inches.  Bassett and Lourdes soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Cresco soils have an argillic horizon that typically contains about 35 percent clay.  Protivin soils have colors of lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon."

Bassett soils are on higher convex ridgetops and interfluvial divides. Kenyon soils are on similar landscapes but commonly are downslope and are on steeper slopes.  Clyde and Floyd soils are in swales and drainageways downslope, are wetter and have grayer colors in the B horizon.  Donnan soils have more clayey 2B horizons and commonly are upslope from the Cresken soils.  Olin soils are sandy loam in the upper part of the solum.  They are on similar landscape positions as the Cresken soils."
