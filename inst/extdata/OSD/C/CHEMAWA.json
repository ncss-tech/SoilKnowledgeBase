The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. The 2 to 42 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. Shot-like aggregates (2 to 4 mm in size) range from 10 to 30 percent in the surface layer and decrease with depth. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 0 to 25 percent.\nThe Ac horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. Texture is ashy loam or gravelly ashy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. Texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy loam, ashy silt loam, or gravelly ashy loam. Reaction is moderately acid through neutral."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and basalt alluvium. Summers are cool and dry. Winters are cold and wet, with intermittent snow cover from December through March. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches. The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 160 days."
