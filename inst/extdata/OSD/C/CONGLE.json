  "OVERVIEW": "The Congle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on backslopes and footslopes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 410 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
