  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to the underlying fine-textured material ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The soil contains few or no rock fragments. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the solum and from neutral through moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand. Structure is weak, very fine through medium, granular.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6 and few to common high chroma mottles. In places the lower part of the B horizon has gray or grayish brown mottles below a depth of 18 inches. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sand. Small areas of uncoated sand grains have colors with chroma of 2 and value of 6 or 7. It is structureless or has weak, very fine through medium, subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture ranges from silty clay loam to clay. Some pedons have subhorizons up to 5 inches thick that are silt or silt loam. The horizon is massive or has weak or moderate, medium or thick plate-like divisions as\ndepositional varves. Free carbonates are usually present."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Cosad is the only known member of the same family. Cosad soils are wetter analogues of Claverack and have distinct mottles, including some with chroma of 2 or less in the B horizon above 18 inches.\nThe Deerfield, Elmwood, Elnora and Galen series are similar soils in related families. Deerfield, Elnora and Galen soils lack the contrasting finer textured 2C horizon within a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Galen soils have an argillic horizon in the form of lamellae. Elmwood soils have contrasting fine\ntextured C horizons similar to Claverack but have a coarse-loamy over sandy particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Claverack series occupies nearly level to sloping landscapes on deltas or in similar sandy deposits associated with glacial lake sediments. The sand, which overlies finer textured sediments, is dominated by quartz and has been derived primarily from non-calcareous sandstone or granite. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The climate is humid and cool-temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 50 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 52 degrees F.; and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days. The elevation of these soils ranges from 95 to 600 feet above sea level."

Other associates are the Arkport, Colonie, Lamson, Minoa, and Stafford. All of these soils lack the clayey substrata; in addition Arkport and Colonie soils occupy better drained parts of the landscapes, and Lamson, Minoa and Stafford soils occupy wetter parts of the landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In some places, where the sandy mantle is of minimal thickness, cambic horizons have developed in the upper part of the clayey material. Such pedons classify as sandy over clayey, mixed, mesic Arenic Eutrudepts and have been correlated as taxadjuncts of the Claverack series. It is known that some soils included with Claverack in mapping have fine-silty rather than clayey substrata.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Aquic subgroup - saturated with water within 60 inches of the surface for one month or more as evidenced by low chroma mottles below 32 inches (2C horizon).\n3. Superactive CEC class - S85NY031-02 (Claverack lfs from '85 DOT sampling Essex Co. NY)\n4. Non-cambic pedogenic horizon - the zone from 8 to 22 inches (Bw horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
