  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with water throughout the year and are subject to fresh water overflow during spring floods unless diked and artificially drained.  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F.  The depth to the mineral substratum is 16 to 40 inches.  The organic material is decomposed grasses, sedges and rushes; woody fragments are in the subsurface tier.  The organic material and the mineral substratum are extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe surface tier has value of 1 or 2 moist.  Fiber content ranges from 10 to 50 percent unrubbed and 0 to 20 percent rubbed.  Typically a surface mantle of mineral soil material 6 to 12 inches thick overlies the organic soil material.  Some pedons have mottles with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 moist.\nThe subsurface tier has fiber content of 40 to 90 percent unrubbed and 20 to 35 percent rubbed.\nThe 3Cg has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y but some pedons range to 10YR or 5G, value is 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 10 to 30 percent clay.  Some pedons have mottles with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR."

The soils formed in organic material from herbaceous plants overlying silty alluvium.  The climate is characterized by warm moist summers and cool wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches.  The mean July temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F; mean January temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days.  The soils are on the Horseshoe geomorphic surface."
