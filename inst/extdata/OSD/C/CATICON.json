  "OVERVIEW": "The Caticon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in pluvial lake sediments and alluvium.  These soils are on lake plains on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
