    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the upper boundary of the Bt horizon ranges from 25 to 39 inches.  The combined thickness of the A, E and Bt horizons range from 42 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 54 to 59 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 55 days during the late summer.  Rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite and sandstone gravel and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5 dry, and 2 to 4 moist.  Moist chroma of less than 3.5 occurs only at depths of less than 9 inches.  This horizon is gravelly loam, stony loam, or coarse sandy loam in the upper part and gravelly, stony or cobbly loam or coarse sandy loam in the lower part.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Rock fragment content is 10 to 35 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.  It is gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly fine sandy loam to very gravelly, very cobbly or cobbly sandy loam or cobbly loam.  This horizon tongues into the Bt horizon.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 8 dry, and 4 to 6 moist.  It ranges from very gravelly or very cobbly clay loam to extremely gravelly, or extremely cobbly, sandy clay loam.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure.  It has few to common, thin clay films.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral acid.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 70 percent.\nThe C horizon is very gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam to extremely gravelly rock fragment content is 55 to 80 percent."

Buffmeyer soils have hue of 5Y to 7.5YR in the Bt horizon and have less than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Geiser and Wapshilla soils lack an E horizon.  Jonda soils have lime in the substratum.  Judkins and Scandard soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.  Mulgon soils have sola 15 to 40 inches thick and the upper boundary of the Bt horizon is at 10 to 24 inches. Namon soils have a very cobbly very fine sandy loam to very cobbly sandy loam Bt horizon and are neutral to moderately alkaline."
