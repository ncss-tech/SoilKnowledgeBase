  "OVERVIEW": "The Clayburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial drift, colluvium, or alluvium derived mainly from shale, sandstone, and andesite, with some basalt.  Clayburn soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nIn Utah this series is correlated with High Mountain range sites.\nThis revision refines the concept of this series to a udic moisture regime that borders on xeric. This more accurately reflects the moisture regime and vegetation at the type location.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nActivity class is presumed based on general trend of other soils in the area."
