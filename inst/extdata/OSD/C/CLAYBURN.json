(A1, A2, A3, BA, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  the zone from 24 to 41 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 24 to 41 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nIn Utah this series is correlated with High Mountain range sites.\nThis revision refines the concept of this series to a udic moisture regime that borders on xeric. This more accurately reflects the moisture regime and vegetation at the type location.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nActivity class is presumed based on general trend of other soils in the area.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
