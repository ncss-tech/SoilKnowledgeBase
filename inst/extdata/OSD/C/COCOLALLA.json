The ash in the Cocolalla soils is from the eruption of Mount Mazama. The content of ash is very high, but because of the sustained water table it has not weathered enough to meet the acid oxalate Al plus one-half Fe criteria for andic soil properties. Diatomaceous earth may be in some pedons. The formatting of the OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska, pedon numbers S57 Wash-32-3 (1-8) and S57 Wash-32-4 (1-7)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
