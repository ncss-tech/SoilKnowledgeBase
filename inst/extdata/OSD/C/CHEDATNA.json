  "OVERVIEW": "The Chedatna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of ash-influenced loess overlying glaciofluvial deposits.  Chedatna soils are on alluvial terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

The exchange complex of the solum is dominated by amorphous material.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nA horizons, up to 5 inches thick, are present in some pedons.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist is 2 or 3; and chroma moist is 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe B horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is usually silt loam, but ranges to include loam and very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist from 3 to 6; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe 2C horizon is sand or loamy sand with less than 50 percent very fine sand.  Thin strata of sandy loam occur in some pedons.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent."
