Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on August 12, 1979, the soil was dry throughout.\nAbout 20 percent of the soil surface is partially covered with fine and medium pumice gravel.\nA1--0 to 1 inch; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent pumice pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.  (1/2 to 1 inch thick).\nA2--1 to 8 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent pumice pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the soft tuff is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of 10 and 40 inches is usually dry from the end of April through November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 8 degrees C from March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent throughout the profile.  Ash content is 60 to 100 percent by weight. The soil surface is partially covered with 15 to 30 percent fine and medium gravel.  All rock fragments are pumice fragments, both on the surface and in the profile.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Electrical conductivity is 0 to 2 dS/m\nThe A horizon color is 7.5YR 6/4, 7/4; or 10YR 7/3, and moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; or 10YR 5/3.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  Gravel content is 5 to 30 percent, with most of the gravel in the surface inch.  The organic carbon content is 0.1 to 0.3 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 5YR 7/4, and moist color is 5YR 5/4 or 7.5YR 5/4.   Gravel content is 5 to 15 percent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Chidago soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1.  Ochric epipedon\n1.1  Color values for the surface soil do not meet mollic criteria (7.5YR 6/4, 7/4, 10YR 7/3).\nOther Diagnostic Horizons or Soil Characteristics:\n1.  The soil lacks a subsurface diagnostic horizon because:\n1.1  There are no clay films, no structure and no segregated lime.\n2.  The particle-size control section averages loamy sand or coarser. No very gravelly or loamy lenses.\n3.  Mineralogy is ashy.  (Verified by SCS Lincoln Lab).\n4.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.  M.A.P.  i. 6 to 8 inches.  This is extrapolated from weather data from Benton, Bishop, Mono Lake, and Long Valley.\n5.  The soil temperature regime is thermic.  M.A.S.T.\ni. 59 to 64 degrees F.  This is extrapolated from actual temperature transect data over the last years using Rod Arkley's equation.\n6.  The soil between depths of 10 and 40 inches is usually dry from the end of April through November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F from March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 41 degrees F.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
