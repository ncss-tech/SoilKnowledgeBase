  "OVERVIEW": "The Cassolary series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in reworked glacial drift and marine sediments.  The soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 5 percent pebbles and 15 to 50 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following summer solstice.\nAn A or Ap horizon, in some pedons, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is single grained or has weak granular structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon commonly has mottles with chroma greater than 2.  This horizon is stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam. It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon commonly has mottles with chroma greater than 2.  It is stratified and is predominantly silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam with layers of fine sandy loam or loamy sand above 40 inches.  Below 40 inches, the C horizon ranges from silty clay loam to gravelly sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral."

Arrastre and Bestrom soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Barron soils have a massive B horizon and a large amount of coarse granitic sand in the control section.  Clayton soils lack a lithologic discontinuity and have bands of accumulation of clay in the lower part of the control section.  Frailey soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the control section and are loam or gravelly loam throughout the control section.  Green Bluff soils are 35 to 60 percent pyroclastic material in the control section.  Koerling soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the B horizon and have a calcareous 2C horizon at 24 to 40 inches.  Hudnut and Kartas soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Koseth soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are neutral or mildly alkaline throughout. Scala soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithologic discontinuity and have bands of accumulation of clay in the lower part of the control section.  Stoner soils are dry for 90 days, have a solum 30 to 47 inches thick, 15 to 35 percent gravel and lack a discontinuity within 40 inches."
