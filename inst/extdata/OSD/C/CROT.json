  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Crot soils are on level to nearly level alkali flats bordering playas at elevations of 3,800 to 4,300 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent but may have uneven microrelief due to wind shifting of the surface soil.  These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone.  The climate is warm semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains.  The months of May and June are usually dry."
