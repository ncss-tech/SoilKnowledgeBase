  "OVERVIEW": "The Crot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone. Crot soils are on alkali flats bordering playas with slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent but may have uneven microrelief due to wind shifting of the surface soil.  These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone.  The climate is warm semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains.  The months of May and June are usually dry."
