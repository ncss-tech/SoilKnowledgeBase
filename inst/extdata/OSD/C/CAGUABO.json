  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Caguabo series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes of strongly dissected uplands.  They formed in material that weathered from basalt.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is 76 degrees F.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.",

Texture is loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is gravelly to extremely analogs of silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Content of saprolite ranges from 0 to 20 percent, by volume.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is gravelly to extremely analogs of silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6; or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored.  Texture is gravelly or very gravelly analogs of sandy clay loam or clay loam. Content of saprolite ranges from 20 to 60 percent, by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of weathered basalt saprolite that is similar in color and texture as the C horizon.\nThe R layer is consolidated basalt bedrock."
