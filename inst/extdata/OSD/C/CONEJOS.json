  "OVERVIEW": "The Conejos series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from tuff and breccia.  Conejos soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.",
