The soil between depths of 18 and 54 inches is moist in all parts from December through April 15, and is dry in all parts from July through October.  The particle size control section commonly is 20 to 30 percent clay, but may range to 35 percent.  Cobble content commonly is 5 to 25 percent, gravel content commonly is 45 to 65 percent, and stones are 0 to 10 percent.  The surface may be nonstony or stony, with stones and boulders 10 inches to 8 feet in diameter when present.  This soil is strongly influenced by amorphous material throughout.  Coarse and very coarse sand is less than 15 percent throughout.  The base saturation varies from 50 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4; 5YR 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4; 5YR 4/4 or 4/7.  It is very gravelly loam or stony loam.  It is neutral through medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6; 5YR 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5YR 4/6.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam, cobbly loam or cobbly clay loam, or stony loam or stony clay loam.  Clay content decreases in the lower part of the Bt or BCt horizon by at least 1.2 times to 1.5 times its maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  It is neutral or slightly acid."
