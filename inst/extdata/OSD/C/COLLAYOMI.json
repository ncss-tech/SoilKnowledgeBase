  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 to 80 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 51 to 56 degrees F, and is below 41 degrees F up to only 30 to 50 days.  The soil between depths of 18 and 54 inches is moist in all parts from December through April 15, and is dry in all parts from July through October.  The particle size control section commonly is 20 to 30 percent clay, but may range to 35 percent.  Cobble content commonly is 5 to 25 percent, gravel content commonly is 45 to 65 percent, and stones are 0 to 10 percent.  The surface may be nonstony or stony, with stones and boulders 10 inches to 8 feet in diameter when present.  This soil is strongly influenced by amorphous material throughout.  Coarse and very coarse sand is less than 15 percent throughout.  The base saturation varies from 50 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4; 5YR 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4; 5YR 4/4 or 4/7.  It is very gravelly loam or stony loam.  It is neutral through medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6; 5YR 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5YR 4/6.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam, cobbly loam or cobbly clay loam, or stony loam or stony clay loam.  Clay content decreases in the lower part of the Bt or BCt horizon by at least 1.2 times to 1.5 times its maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  It is neutral or slightly acid."

The soils are formed in material weathered from andesite, dacite, and basalt rocks.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 30 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is 49 degrees F; mean July temperature is 61 degrees F; the mean annual temperature varies from 50 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 200 days."
