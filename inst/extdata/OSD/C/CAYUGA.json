  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the lithologic till substratum is 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume above the lithologic discontinuity and from 10 to 50 percent below. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 inches to 60 inches or more.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam through silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, subangular blocky or platy, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nIn some pedons a Bt/E horizon replaces or underlies the E horizon. The E part has moist colors similar to the E horizon and dry color value of 6 through 8 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. In pedons lacking Bt/E horizons, the upper 2 to 4 inches of the Bt horizon has uncoated silt and sand grains on faces of peds 1 to 2 millimeters thick with dry color with value of 6 through 8 and chroma of 2 or 3. The horizon often lacks redoximorphic features, but some pedons have few or common, faint or distinct iron oxide concentrations. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from silty clay loam or clay loam, through clay. Structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, or prismatic over structure parting to these. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam through clay. Structure is moderate or strong, medium or coarse subangular or angular blocky, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline. Free carbonates are present in most pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family.\nCaneadea, Odessa, and Rhinebeck series are in related families. Caneadea, Odessa and Rhinebeck soils have reduced matrices or ped faces with dominant chroma of 2 or less and redoximorphic features in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cayuga soils are undulating, rolling, and hilly soils on till plains where a thin fine-textured deposit from proglacial lakes overlies the till. The underlying till is derived from limestone, dolomite, sandstone or shale. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 42 inches; and the mean annual frost-free period ranges from 130 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 95 to 800 feet above sea-level."

Churchville soils are somewhat poorly drained associates in a drainage sequence with Cayuga soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Cayuga Series was originally classified in the Great Group of Hapludalfs, but because changes established in the 5th edition of \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy\" this soil now classifies in the Great Group of Glossudalfs.\nIncluded in the range of Cayuga are some pedons that may have a dense C horizon. This needs to be considered in maintenance of the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric Epipedon - from 0 to 12 inches (Ap and E horizons).\n2) Argillic horizon - from 12 to 25 inches (Bt horizon).\n3) Glossic horizon - from 12 to 15 inches as evidenced by albic\nmaterials on faces of peds constituting more than 15 percent of the remnant argillic horizon.\n4) Oxyaquic Subgroup - as evidenced by redoximorphic features from 25 to 32 inches (2C horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
