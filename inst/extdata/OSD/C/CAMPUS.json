Depth to the calcic horizon is less than 24 inches; calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is loam or clay loam but includes sandy loam and silty clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons lack Bw horizons and may have AC horizons with colors and textures like the Bw horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragments make up to 20 percent of the C horizon by volume."

Ethan soils do not have bedrock within depths of 40 inches and have slightly cooler mean annual temperature.  Penden soils have less than 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent within 24 inches of the surface.  Canlon soils have hard caliche at depths less than 20 inches.  Canyon soils have a paralithic contact at depths less than 20 inches.  Carlson soils have an argillic horizon and have fine textures.  Clark, Mansic, and Mansker soils are thermic.  Elkader and Wakeen soils are fine-silty."

The soil is formed in highly calcareous, partially consolidated old alluvium, or residuum weathered thereof, modified by a component of calcareous, silty eolian sediments.  The mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from 18 to 25 inches.  Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 32 to 46."
