  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches for less than 45 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to Cd horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages more than 35 percent rock fragments.  The soil reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.  The moist bulk density is 0.70 to 0.80 g/cc throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments of which 5 to 15 percent are gravel and concretions and 15 to 25 percent are cobbles.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam or very cobbly sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.   It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and concretions and 20 to 40 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon is very cobbly loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly loam.   It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 25 to 45 percent cobbles.  It is weakly consolidated or moderately consolidated."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cupola soils are on terraces and mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured cobbly glacial outwash from mixed volcanic materials.  Elevation is 1,000 to 2,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 65 to 85 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."
