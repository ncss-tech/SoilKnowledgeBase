  "OVERVIEW": "The Cupola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in cobbly glacial outwash of mixed volcanic origin.  These soils are on high terraces and footslopes of the western Cascade Mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to Cd horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages more than 35 percent rock fragments.  The soil reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.  The moist bulk density is 0.70 to 0.80 g/cc throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments of which 5 to 15 percent are gravel and concretions and 15 to 25 percent are cobbles.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam or very cobbly sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.   It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and concretions and 20 to 40 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon is very cobbly loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly loam.   It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 25 to 45 percent cobbles.  It is weakly consolidated or moderately consolidated."
