  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Chipotle series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in gravelly alluvium from tuff. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on inset fans of the fan piedmont. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
