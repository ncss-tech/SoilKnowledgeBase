  "REVDATE": "10/2007",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Crestman series consist of shallow, well to excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered in place from calcareous sandstone.  Crestman soils are on rolling to hilly uplands and plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually calcareous throughout, but the surface 3 or 4 inches may be noncalcareous. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46F.  The control section is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Sandstone rock fragments 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through  6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Textures include fine sand and gravelly loamy sand."
