    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually calcareous throughout, but the surface 3 or 4 inches may be noncalcareous. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46F.  The control section is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Sandstone rock fragments 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through  6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Textures include fine sand and gravelly loamy sand."

Elevation is 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches and occurs mainly in the winter and spring.  The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 100 days."
