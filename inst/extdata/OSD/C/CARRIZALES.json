Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where chroma is 2, it is from parent material and not an indication of wetness.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

The well drained Algarrobo and Corozo soils are Spodosols and have clayey argillic horizons below the spodic horizon.  Guerrero soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick, and have clayey, kaolinitic argillic horizons.   The moderately well drained Jobos soils have more clay in the subsoil.  The somewhat excessively drained Rio Lajas soils have argillic horizons."
