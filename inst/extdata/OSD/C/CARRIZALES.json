  "REVDATE": "03/2005",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Carrizales series consists of very deep, excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils on low uplands of the coastal plain.  They formed in sands high in quartz.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sand is more than 60 inches.  It consists of 95 percent or more quartz in the soil fraction.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where chroma is 2, it is from parent material and not an indication of wetness.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Algarrobo, Corozo, Guerrero, Jobos, and Rio Lajas series.  All of these soils are on similar positions.  The well drained Algarrobo and Corozo soils are Spodosols and have clayey argillic horizons below the spodic horizon.  Guerrero soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick, and have clayey, kaolinitic argillic horizons.   The moderately well drained Jobos soils have more clay in the subsoil.  The somewhat excessively drained Rio Lajas soils have argillic horizons."
