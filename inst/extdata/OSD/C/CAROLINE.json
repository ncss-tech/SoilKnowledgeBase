  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 45 to 84 inches or more.  Rock fragments of ironstone or quartz gravel make up 0 to 10 percent of the solum and 0 to 20 percent of the C horizon.  Depth to stratified layers of sandy, clayey, or gravelly soil materials is over 5 feet.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Where value of 2 or 3, it is less than 6 inches thick. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Eroded areas include clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Eroded areas include clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  High or low chroma mottles are few to many in the middle and lower part of the Bt horizon (see remarks).  The lower part of the Bt horizon is variegated or mottled without dominant matrix hue in some pedons.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Some pedons have subhorizons of sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  The Bt horizon has moderate subangular blocky structure in the upper part and grades to platy or prismatic in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is variegated or mottled without dominant matrix hue and with high and low value and chroma.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon has colors and mottles similar to those of the lower part of the Bt horizon.  It commonly is stratified and includes fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in the fine earth fraction."
