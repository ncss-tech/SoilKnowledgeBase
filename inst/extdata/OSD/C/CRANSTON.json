  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The depth to acid siltstone or shale bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 feet.  Coarse fragments are pebbles or channers of acid siltstone and range from 5 to 60 percent by volume in the A horizons, from 15 to 45 percent in subhorizons of the B horizon, and from 15 to 60 percent in the C horizon; weighted average in the control section is less than 35 percent.  The fine earth fraction throughout the soil is silt loam. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid, except where limed; the Ap horizon ranges to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have Ap or E horizons with hue of 10R or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe BE horizons has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe C horizon has hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.   In some pedons the BC and C horizons have few to common grayish mottles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chavies, Highfield, Lewisberry, Tracy and Watertown series.  Chavies soils have fine sandy loam or loam B horizons and less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the solum.  Highfield soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and coarse fragments are metorhyolte, schist, rhyolite, or sandstone.  Lewisberry soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Tracy and Watertown soils have formed in glacial outwash and Tracy soils have a high content of shale fragments.  Rigley and Shelocta are similar soils which have less than 35 percent base saturation; in addition, in Rigley soils the fine earth fraction of the B horizon is sandy loam or loam, and Shelocta soils have particle-size control sections with more than 18 percent clay."

Gilpin soils have an argillic horizon with more than 18 percent clay, and bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Morehead soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments, and grayish mottles in the B horizons.

Base saturation on six widely scattered samples in Greenup County, Kentucky, ranged from 40 to 70 percent; only one was more that 60 percent. Cranston soils were fromerly included with the Shelocta series.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A).\nArgillic horizon-the zone from 13 to 50 inches (Bt1,Bt2,Bt3).\nAdditional Data: Characterization data: S92KY-205-4 -University of Kentucky.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
