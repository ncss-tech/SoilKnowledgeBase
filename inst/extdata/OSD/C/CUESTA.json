  "OVERVIEW": "The Cuesta series consists of moderately deep well drained soils formed in material weathered from serpentine rock.  They are on mountainsides and ridge tops at an elevation of 600 to 3,000 feet.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic or a lithic contact is from 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be between 59 degrees and 64 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is estimated to usually be dry in all parts from June to October and usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Surface rock fragments range from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/2 or 3/3; and moist color of 10YR 2/2; 7.5YR 3/3, 4/3; 5YR 3/3, 3/2; 2.5/2 or 2.5Y 3/2.  It is a cobbly, gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.   It has weak to strong granular or subangular blocky structure.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Base saturation is estimated about 85 to 95 percent.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4; 5YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2 or 2.5/2; and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; 5YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 2.5Y 4/4 or 4/2.  It is gravelly clay, very gravelly clay, gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, very stoney or extremely stony clay or clay loam.  It has weak to strong subangular blocky structure.  Rock fragments average more than 35 percent and range from 10 to 55 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, and 5 to 60 percent stones.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Clay films may occur in cracks between the rock fragments and adhere to cobbles.  Base saturation is estimated about 75 to 95 percent.\nA B3, C or Cr horizon may occur between the B2t horizon and hard bedrock."
