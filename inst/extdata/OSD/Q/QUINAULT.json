  "OVERVIEW": "The Quinault series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 185 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic soil moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.40 to 0.60 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 35 to 50 percent for air-dried samples, acid oxalate iron is 2.0 to 3.5, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 2 to 6 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 20 to 30 percent organic matter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam."
