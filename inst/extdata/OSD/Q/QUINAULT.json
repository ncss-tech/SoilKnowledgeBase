The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.40 to 0.60 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 35 to 50 percent for air-dried samples, acid oxalate iron is 2.0 to 3.5, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 2 to 6 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 20 to 30 percent organic matter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam."
