    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 degrees F.  and mean summer soil temperature is 61 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous materlal ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The soils range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  Depth to sandy-skeletal material ranges from 12 to 25 inches.  The control section averages 0 to 5 percent gypsum and a majority of subhorizons above 24 inches do not exceed 3 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches except that thin subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness and containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium or with conductivity exceeding 14 millimhos occur inconsistently in some pedons.  The upper part of the control section above the sandy-skeletal material has 5 to 18 percent clay, 35 to 85 percent fine or coarser sand and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments, dominantly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR except that a few subhorizons having hue redder than 7.5YR occur discontinuously in some pedons and occupy less than half the thickness of the control section."

Tinsley soils are coarse textured throughout the control section and formed in parent materials that have only minor influence from basalt."

The soils formed in thick, very gravelly, calcareous, fan alluvium derived principally from basalt.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with a sprlng and early summer rainfall pattern.  Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F; mean summer temperature is 62 degrees F."
