Slidymtn and Motoqua soils are formed in volcanic rocks, the Santa Fe and Hiddenforest soils formed in acid igneous rocks, and the Montvale soils in Sandstone.  The Slidymtn and Hiddenforest soils are in the ustic aridic soil moisture regime and the Montvale soils have a frost free season of only 105 to 140 days.  The Buckspring has a clay content in the particle size control section ranging from 15 to 25 percent."
