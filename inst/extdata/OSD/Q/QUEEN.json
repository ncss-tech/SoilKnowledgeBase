  "OVERVIEW": "The Queen series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils on mountaintops, moutainsides and escarpments. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone, carbonitic sandstone and eolian dust. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
