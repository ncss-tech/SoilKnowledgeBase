  "OVERVIEW": "The Quapaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Quapaw soils are on backslopes of escarpments and canyons. Slopes are 60 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
