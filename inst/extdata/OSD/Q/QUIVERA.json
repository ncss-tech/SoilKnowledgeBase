  "OVERVIEW": "The Quivera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived from pyroclastics.  Quivera soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean air annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
