    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 56 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches each year during the summer for 50 to 70 consecutive days. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam or very fine sandy loam and averages 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe C horizon is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam."

The soils formed in loamy old alluvium of mixed origin.  The climate is temperate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The mean January temperature is 36 degrees to 38 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 65 degrees to 67 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees to 54 degrees F.
