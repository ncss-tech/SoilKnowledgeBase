    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 56 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches each year during the summer for 50 to 70 consecutive days. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam or very fine sandy loam and averages 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe C horizon is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam."
