  "OVERVIEW": "The Quakenasp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone or interbedded shale and sandstone. These soils occur on hills. Slopes are 20 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.",
