Muldrow soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Parsons and Taloka soils have an abrupt textural change.  Urich soils have mollic epipedons and less clay in the subsoil."

Osage soils have a thickened mollic epipedon and are on flood plains. Verdigris soils have a thickened mollic epipedon, less clay, are better drained and on flood plains."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 inches (Ap horizon).  The upper 8 inches has color to qualify for a mollic subgroup.  Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 18 inches (Eg horizon).  Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 18 to 62 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 and Btg4 horizons).\n5/25/00: PRF: modified classification to Endo from Ochr.  Expanded value in Btg from 5 to 6.
