  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Izagora, Kullit and Wrightsboro series are the only known series in the same family and the Goldsboro series is in a closely related family. All of these soils are moderately well drained. Izagora and Wrightsboro soils have no brittleness in the subsoils. Kullit soils have redder subsoils. Goldsboro soils are subactive, have less than 25 percent silt and no brittleness in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quitman soils are on terraces and uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in marine or fluvial loamy material. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 58 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Cahaba, Daleville, Harleston, Myatt, Prentiss, Savannah and Stough series. The well drained Cahaba soils are on higher positions on terraces and have redder subsoils and thinner sola. The poorly drained Daleville and Myatt soils are in lower positions on stream terraces and upland flats. The moderately well drained Harleston soils have coarse-loamy control sections. The moderately well drained Prentiss and Savannah soils are on slightly higher positions and have a fragipans. The somewhat poorly drained Stough soils have coarse-loamy control sections and are brittle and compact in 40 to 55 percent of the subsoil."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Quitman soils are somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow and permeability is moderately slow. A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 2.0 feet during winter and early spring. Some areas of this soil on low terraces are subject to occasional flooding."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Quitman soils are used for pasture and forests. Some areas have been cleared and are used for growing cotton, corn, and soybeans. The forested areas are mainly mixed hardwoods and pines; common trees are sweetgum, American sycamore, loblolly pine, and slash pine."
