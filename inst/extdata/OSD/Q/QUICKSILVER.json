These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from intermediate intrusive rocks.  The landscape commonly has 3 to 30 percent outcropping of bedrock.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 410 to 560 mm and average annual temperature ranges from4.4 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 65 to 95 days."
