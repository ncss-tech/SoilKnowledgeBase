  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quadria soils are on broad upland pediments. Slopes are linear to convex with gradients of 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in alluvium derived from tuff of the Duff and Pruett Formations, with lesser amounts of rock fragments derived from the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July through September. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,000 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Beewon, Borunda, Chilicotal, Musgrave, Rockpens, and Straddlebug series. Beewon soils are on older, slighter higher pediments. Borunda soils are in the fine-loamy family, have a gypsic horizon, and are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock. They are on higher erosional uplands. Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and have a calcic horizon in the control section, and are on alluvial fan positions higher in the landscape. Musgrave soils are very shallow or shallow to tuffaceous bedrock and are on short steep scarps and sideslopes of Pleistocene terraces. Rockpens soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are on higher late-Pleistocene stream terraces. Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on higher Holocene age alluvial flats and floodplains."
