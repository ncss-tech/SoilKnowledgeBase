    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quinnamose soils are on side slopes of mountains and foothills at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet (610 to 1376 meters). They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 43 inches (559 to 1092 mm). The average annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."

Micapeak soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are on convex backslopes of foothills. Spokane soils are mesic, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and are on convex backslopes of foothills."
