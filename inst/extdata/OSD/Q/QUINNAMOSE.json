  "OVERVIEW": "The Quinnamose series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain and foothill slopes. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slope ranges from 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
