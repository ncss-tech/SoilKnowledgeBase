Bullgulch, Loeb, Macklyn, Wadecreek and Winchuck soils have umbric epipedons.  In addition, Loeb and Vandamme soils are deep, and Macklyn soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Hunterscove soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact.  Vandamme soils are 40 to 60 inches to paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Quinliven soils occur on marine terraces. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 9 percent on the terrace tops, with slopes of 9 to 50 percent occurring on the terrace shoulders and in drainageways that dissect the terraces.  Elevations are 100 to 1000 feet.  The soil formed in marine sediments.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."

The soil is saturated with water between the depths of 48 and 72 inches for very brief periods of time, above the B/C horizon interface or above the slowly permeable layers of the subsoil, during the months of December through April in most years.  Surface runoff under bare soil conditions is slow through rapid.  Permeability is slow in the subsoil and moderately rapid in the substratum."
