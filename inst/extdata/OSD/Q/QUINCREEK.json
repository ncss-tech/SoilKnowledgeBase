  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Quincreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from fractured red shale bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, knolls and sideslopes of hills. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
