  "OVERVIEW": "The Quinto series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone, conglomerate and basic volcanic rocks. Slope is 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches and is extremely variable over very short distances. Some pedons have a paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 18 inches which occurs above the lithic contact. About 25 to 50 percent of the original surface horizon has been lost through erosion. The moisture control section is moist throughout from about November 15 to May 1 and dry throughout from about June 1 to October 15 most years. The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from January 1 to February 15. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. Rounded or angular rock fragment content, mainly as gravel, is 15 to 35 percent throughout the profile and varies considerably over short distances.\nThe A horizon has color of 5YR 5/4; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4. Moist color is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4 or 10YR 3/3, 3/4. Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent. Clay content is 10 to 20 percent. Cobble content is 0 to 3 percent. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4. Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4; 10YR 4/3 or 4/4. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent. Clay content is 20 to 35 percent. Cobble content is 0 to 7 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

Raggulch soils (MLRA 17), on dissected terraces, are well drained, have slope of 5 to 30 percent and have hue color of 10YR and 2.5Y. Saltos soils (MLRA 15), on hills and mountains, are moist throughout for only 60 consecutive days. Stonyford soils (MLRA 15, 18), on mountains, have mean annual precipitation of 25 to 60 inches, formed in material weathered from basic igneous rocks and related tuff breccia with a lithic contact of metamorphosed basalt. Strahle soils (MLRA 18), on hills and mountains, formed mainly on volcanic and granitic rocks and have a lithic contact of hard, fractured andesitic rock and is moist in all parts for about 115 consecutive days."

These soils formed in material weathered from conglomerate or fractured sandstone dominantly from the Franciscan and Quiensabe Formations. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 46 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 79 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 56 to 63 degrees F. Frost-free season is 190 to 240 days."
