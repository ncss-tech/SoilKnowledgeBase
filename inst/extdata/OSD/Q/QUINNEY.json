  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F. The soils are moist for 55 to 65 percent of the time and are dry in all parts of the 8 to 24 inch zone for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more in the summer and autumn.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 15 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and Btn horizons ranges from 16 to 21 inches over the horizon of carbonate accumulation. A water table occurs at variable depths below 30 inches. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the A horizon, 15 to 50 percent in the Btn horizon and usually 40 to 80 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak thin platy to weak fine to medium granular to subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist in the upper portion and and 6 dry and 4 moist in the lower portion and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from loam to very fine sandy loam or silt loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and averages less than very fine sand and averages less than 18 percent clay.  This horizon has weak to moderate, medium prismatic structure that parts to subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.  The Btn horizon has thin to moderately thick, common to continuous clay films.  It is 8 to 13 inches thick.\nThe Ck and C horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  They have common distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles at depths below 24 inches.  These horizons range from silt loam or loam to silty clay and some areas of fine sandy loam."

These soils formed in mixed lake sediments.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 120 to 140 days."
