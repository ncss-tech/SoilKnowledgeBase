  "OVERVIEW": "The Quiden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from basalt mixed with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Quiden soils are on plateaus and benches. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
