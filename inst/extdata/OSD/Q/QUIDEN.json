  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quiden soils are on plateaus and benches at elevations of 1,700 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in residuum derived from basalt mixed with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Summers are warm and dry; winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 70 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free season is 115 to 135 days."

Kaiders and Suta soils are loamy-skeletal. Kaiders soils are on mountains and foothills; Suta soils are on canyon side slopes. Presher soils are frigid, have a moisture control section that is dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days and are on plateaus and footslopes of mountains. Nook soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon, lack an argillic horizon and are on alluvial fans."
