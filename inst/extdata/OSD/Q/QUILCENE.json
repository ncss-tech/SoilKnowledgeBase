  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to about 53 degrees F.  The mineralogy is mixed. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for more than 60 consecutive days in most years.  Soil reaction ranges from modertely acid to strongly acid.  The control section contains 35 to 50 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Solum thickness and depth to weathered shale or sandstone bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils have ochric epipedons.\nThe A horizons are in 5YR to 10YR hue, range in values of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma from 2 to 4 moist or dry.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam, and have weak to moderate blocky or granular structure.\nThe Bw horizons are in 7.5YR to 2.5Y hue, range in value and chroma from 3 to 5 moist, and are mottled.  They are silty clay loam or silty clay and may be gravelly; and have moderate blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe BC horizons are in 10YR to 5Y hue, range in value from 4 to 6 moist, in chroma from 2 to 4, and are mottled.  They are silty clay loam or silty clay and may be gravelly; and have weak to moderate blocky or prismatic structure.  Chroma 2 or less mottles occur within 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Quilcene soils occur on undulating to steep uplands at elevations of near sea level to about 800 feet.  The regolith consists of weathered shale and sandstone with some modification by glacial action.  These soils occur in a subhumid maritime climate with summers relatively dry and cool and winters wet and mild.  The annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches.  The average January temperature is 40 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the annual frost free growing season is 170 to 190 days."
