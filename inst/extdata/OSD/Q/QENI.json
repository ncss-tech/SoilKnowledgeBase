  "OVERVIEW": "The Qeni series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in an admixture of loess and stratified loamy alluvium over sand and gravel.  Qeni soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 35 degrees F.  and the mean annual temperature ranges from 25 to 45 inches.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A and Ab horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist from 4 through 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizons have texture of coarse sand or sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 70 percent with 0 to 50 percent well rounded cobble and 10 to 70 percent well rounded gravel."
