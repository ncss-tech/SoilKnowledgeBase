    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bagard, Blitzen, Fera, Gosumi, Kleckner, Slaven, and Snellby series.\nBagard and Kleckner soils are very deep.  Blitzen soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Fera and Gosumi soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Slaven soils average 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Snellby soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon above a depth of 50 cm and have a horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates between the argillic horizon and the lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Quarz soils are on hills, plateaus, mountains, and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, chert, conglomerate, quartzite, quartz latite, welded tuff, andesite, or rhyolite.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 240 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Bregar soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons.  Chen soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Duff soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons, and have a cryic temperature regime.  Highams soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, have ochric epipedons, and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Pie Creek soils are very-fine and have an abrupt increase in clay between the mollic epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Torro soils are loamy-skeletal and are very deep."
