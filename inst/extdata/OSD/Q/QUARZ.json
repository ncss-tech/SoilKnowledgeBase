  "OVERVIEW": "The Quarz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from sedimentary rocks.  Quarz soils are on hills, plateaus, mountains, and rock pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Blitzen soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Fera and Gosumi soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Slaven soils average 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Snellby soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon above a depth of 50 cm and have a horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates between the argillic horizon and the lithic contact."

Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 240 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Duff soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons, and have a cryic temperature regime.  Highams soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, have ochric epipedons, and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Pie Creek soils are very-fine and have an abrupt increase in clay between the mollic epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Torro soils are loamy-skeletal and are very deep."
