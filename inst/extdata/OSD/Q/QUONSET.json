  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 38 through 94 centimeters. The volume of channers and gravel ranges from 0 through 50 percent in the A horizon, 15 through 50 percent in the B horizon, and 10 through 70 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments greater than 3 inches range from 0 through 5 percent throughout the soil. Dark minerals dominate the lithology, ranging from 25 through 75 percent of the rock fragments and 15 through 50 percent of the sand fraction. Reaction, where not limed, ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid in the A horizon, from extremely acid through moderately acid in the B horizon and from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the C horizon.\nMost pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Some pedons have Ap horizons that have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth faction. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon and the BC horizon, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth of these horizons is loamy sand. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction and the horizon is normally stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bonaparte, Hinckley, Manchester, Mecosta, Multorpor, Otisville, and Rikers series. Bonaparte soils do not have loamy textures in the upper part and have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches. Hinckley soils have rock fragments dominated by granite, gneiss, and schist. Manchester soils have hue of 5YR or redder. Mecosta and Multorpor soils are from outside of Region R. Mecosta soils have a calcareous C horizon. Multorpor soils have hue of 10YR and chroma of 1 or 2 throughout. Otisville soils have rock fragments dominated by sandstone and conglomerate. Rikers soils are anthropogenic and formed in coal ash and have carboliths, pieces of coal or coal slag, in the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quonset soils are on nearly level through very steep slopes on terraces, outwash plains, deltas, eskers, and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The soils developed in water-sorted sand, gravel, subrounded channers, and flagstones. All were derived dominantly from acid, dark phyllite, shale, or slate, and some schist and gneiss. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.) Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 through 50 inches (1016 through 1270 millimeters). The frost free period ranges from 120 through 180 days."
