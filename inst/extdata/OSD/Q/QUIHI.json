It is gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with coarse fragments comprising 5 to 50 percent by volume.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nBt1 and Bt2 horizons are dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2), dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2), reddish brown (5YR 4/3), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/4), red (2.5YR 4/6), or dusky red (2.5YR 3/2).  Texture of the soil fraction less than 2 mm is clay with clay content ranging from 40 to 70 percent.  Rounded chert pebbles comprise 35 to 85 percent by volume.  The Bt horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  The Bt3 horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4; 2.5YR 4/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), or red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6).  Few to common faint or distinct yellowish and brownish mottles in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR occur on most pedons.  It is clay, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam with less than 20 percent coarse fragments.  Visible calcium carbonate content is the Bt3 horizon may be as high as 5 percent in some pedons.  The Bt3 horizon is lacking in some pedons.\nThe upper part of the Bkm horizon is laminar in most pedons.  The Ck horizon ranges from strongly cemented caliche to weakly consolidated pinkish limy earth of about clay loam texture."
