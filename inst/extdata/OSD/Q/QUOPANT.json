Cucamungo and Grandridge soils have rocks that are mainly 2 to 5 mm in diameter, do not have 2C horizons below the argillic horizons, and have paralithic materials that are weathered granitic rock in the series control section.  Pinew soils do not have 2C horizons below the argillic horizons with less than 35 percent rock fragments. Pinwheeler have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Trailamp soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm and do not have 2C horizons below the argillic horizons."

Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 100 days."
