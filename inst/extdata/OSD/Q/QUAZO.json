Puertecito soils have subhorizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Roygorge soils are more moist in some part during the spring season and may have thin petrocalcic horizons overlying the lithic contact.  Wyva soils are intermittently moist less than 30 days cumulative during the summer season, have less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section, and are dominated by cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Quazo soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 30 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,130 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm with a significant percentage that comes from high-intensity convective storms between July and October.  The mean annual air temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C, mean summer temperature is 21 to 26 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Dagflat soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Motoqua soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of May 2001 updates the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Lithic Ustollic Haplargids and corrects missing information in the typical pedon.  The typical pedon at the series type location is a minor component in a delineation of Dagflat-Motoqua complex, 30 to 70 percent slopes, from the Washington County Area, Utah soil survey.  Field work is needed in the future to verify either that Quazo should be a named major component in the area of the type location or that the type location be moved to a more representative area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 cm (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 46 cm (ABt, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 46 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 46 cm (ABt, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: KMD/VLM/AJE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
