  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Quagmeier series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed from alluvium derived from Claron Formation sandstone and limestone.  Quagmeier soils are on fan remnants, remnant stream terraces, with slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 15 inches and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
