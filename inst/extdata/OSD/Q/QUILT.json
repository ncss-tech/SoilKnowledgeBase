The rock fragment content in the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days during the winter months, but are moist for 50 to 55 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches depth, is more than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  The soils with value of 3 or less moist and 5 or less dry with chroma of 3 or less extent to depths of 10 to 16 inches.  The Bt horizon is cobbly clay, cobbly clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon when present has a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value 5 to 7, dry and 4 to 6 moist, chroma of 2 or 3."

Ethridge and Scobey soils have Bky horizons with accumulations of carbonates and gypsum.  Holderness and Ulric soils are deep to bedrock.  Morop, Nilrap, Nunnston and Scobey soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Tanna soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

These soils are on mountainsides, benches, low hills and fan remnants.  They formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium from mixed igneous rocks, sandstone and shale.  The climate is dry subhumid, the average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches in Utah and ranges up to 18 inches in Colorado. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."
