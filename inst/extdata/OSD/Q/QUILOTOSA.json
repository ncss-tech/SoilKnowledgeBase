Appleseed, Goldroad, Redneedle, and Sunrock soils are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in the summer. In addition, Appleseed soils formed in parent material derived from limestone, Goldroad soils formed in parent material derived from granite and are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel, Redneedle soils formed in parent material derived from sandstone, and Sunrock soils formed in parent material derived from andesite and similar volcanic rocks. Hyder soils have control sections dominated by fine and medium sand, do not have layers of weathered bedrock and formed on volcanic rock."

Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 69 to 78 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 350 days."
