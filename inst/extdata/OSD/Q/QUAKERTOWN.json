  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches in thickness and the argillic horizon from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard rock is 36 to 60 inches.  Coarse fragments are dominantly of weathered fine grained sandstone but includes siltstone and argillite.  They are 5 to 30 percent by volume of the A and B horizons and 20 to 70 percent of the C horizon and average less than 35 percent in the textural control section.  The soil is strongly acid throughout unless limed.  The Ap horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or dark brown (10YR 4/3, 10YR 3/3, or 7.5YR 4/2) and is silt loam or channery silt loam.  Color value of the dry soil is 6 or higher.  The Bt horizon is strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/4 or 10YR 4/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It is heavy silt loam, heavy loam, clay loam or light silty clay loam.  It has weak or moderate medium or coarse subangular blocky structure.  It is firm and is brittle in up to 60 percent of the horizon in the lower part.  The C horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/4), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam."

Allenwood, Caylow, Meadowville, Murrill and Thurmont soils have argillic horizons that extend below a 40 inch depth.  Bedington soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  The Bucks soils have friable silty upper horizons 15 to 36 inches thick, and firm silty lower horizons that contain many shale fragments.  Chester, Chilmark, Clymer, Edgemont, Edneyville and Manasses have control sections of heavy sandy loam, light loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam that average more thatn 30 percent sand.  The Filpin soils have bedrock within a 40 inch depth.  Rayne soils have argillic horizons 20 to 30 inches thick and sola more than 40 inches thick.  Other similar soils are in the Lansdale series which has less that 18 percent clay in the control section."
