  "OVERVIEW": "The Quay series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately fine to medium textured alluvium from red siltstone, shale, and sandstone deposits of the  Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian ages.  These soils are on convex alluvial fans and footslopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F.",
