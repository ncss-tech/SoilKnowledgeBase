Bissell soils are micaceous throughout and contain 0 to 5 percent rock fragments. Bjork, Dodes, Pahrange, Noslo, Shoebend and Uhaldi soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Cowiche soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and do not have lamellae. Fernpoint soils have stratified extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly 2C horizons, secondary calcium carbonates at 40 to 50 inches and mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F. Hullsgulch and Jerusalem soils are greater than 25 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon. Indiano, Madras, Quiero and Simcoe soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Margerum soils have pumice throughout. Orr soils are 35 to 45 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and do not have lamellae. Ralls soils have silt loam and clay loam textures with less than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section and do not have lamellae. Springmeyer soils are dry for more than 145 consecutive days, have relict mottles in the Bt and C horizons and stratified C horizons that do not have lamellae. Truax soils have Bq horizons, are dry for more than 145 consecutive days and have mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 52 degrees F. Wenatchee soils have less than 20 percent medium and coarse sand in the particle-size control section, are over 26 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and do not have lamella in the C horizon above 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quailridge soils are steep to very steep on hill backslopes and gulch slopes (dissected remnant basin-margin fluvial facies) at elevations of 2,700 to 3,850 feet. Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent. These soils formed in deltaic deposits from granitic rocks and volcaniclastic materials. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period is 140 to 155 days."
