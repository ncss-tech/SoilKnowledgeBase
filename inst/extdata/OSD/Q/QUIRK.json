Series with a similar Typic subgroup classification are the Bridgecreek, Coser, Deer Creek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Mohocken, Norcan and Rands series. The Bridgecreek, Coser, and Mohocken soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and lack a vitrandic feature. The Deer Creek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Norcan and Rands soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock."

The soil is formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash overlying residual material derived from volcanic tuffs overlying basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
