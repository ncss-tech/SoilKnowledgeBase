  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated during winter and early spring and during late in irrigated areas unless artifically drained. The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. The organic carbon extent decreases irregulary with depth, and remains above 0.2 percent to a depth of 50 inches. The soil is common nonsaline and nonalkali, but in some areas may be slightly saline or slightly saline-alkali below depth of 36 inches. Redox features are present to the soil surface.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, but ranges to 10YR, value is 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, chroma is commonly 1 dry or moist, but may be 2 when the dry value is 6.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is silty clay or clay with 45 to 60 percent clay."

Elevations are 2,100 to 2,500 feet. The climate has warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Mean annual summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 125 to 170 days."
