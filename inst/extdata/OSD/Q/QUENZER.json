  "OVERVIEW": "The Quenzer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium mainly from granitic origin. Quenzer soils are on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated during winter and early spring and during late in irrigated areas unless artifically drained. The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. The organic carbon extent decreases irregulary with depth, and remains above 0.2 percent to a depth of 50 inches. The soil is common nonsaline and nonalkali, but in some areas may be slightly saline or slightly saline-alkali below depth of 36 inches. Redox features are present to the soil surface.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, but ranges to 10YR, value is 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, chroma is commonly 1 dry or moist, but may be 2 when the dry value is 6.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is silty clay or clay with 45 to 60 percent clay."
