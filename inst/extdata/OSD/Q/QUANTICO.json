Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid; unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 0 to 4.  Value of 4 or less with chroma of 3 or less are limited to thin A horizons.  The A horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.

Boden, Christian, Flagspring, Groseclose, Muse, Sequoia and Trappist soils have rock fragments of sedimentary rocks.  Boden soils have sandstone bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Braddock soils have red Bt horizons.  Buckhall soils formed in residuum that weathered from granite gneiss and schist of the Northern Piedmont Plateau.  Buffstat soils have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Casville soils formed in residuum from felsic or intermediate igneous and metamorphic rock.  Clifton soils formed in residuum weathered from intermediate and mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that are high in ferromagnesium minerals.  Clover soils formed in residuum from Triassic age materials.  Danripple soils formed on stream terraces in the Piedmont.  Goresville Rapidan, Spears Mountain, Totier, and Warminster soils are redder than 5 YR in the Bt.  Howell soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower part of the B horizon.  Mount Rush soils have a parlithic contact 20 and 40 inches.  .  Unison soils have rock fragments of dominantly rounded and subrounded greenstone and granodiorate.  Yellowbottom soils formed in residuum from sericite schist, phyllonite, phyllite, and metamonzagranite.  None of the competing series are underlain with feldspathic sands."

The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Prince William County, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. In addition, horizon nomenclature and competing series were updated with this revision.\n03/2022 revision: Oi had 1 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 1 in horizon depths then added 1 inch to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon.WJN"
