    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Substratum is stratified coastal plain sediments, dominantly of feldspathic sands.  Rock fragments of rounded to subrounded quartz gravel range from 1 to 15 percent in the solum and substratum.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid; unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 0 to 4.  Value of 4 or less with chroma of 3 or less are limited to thin A horizons.  The A horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Low chroma parent material mottling is common in some pedons.  Texture is clay loam to clay.\nThe C horizon is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, red and white.  Texture is sandy loam to sandy clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boden, Braddock, Buckhall, Buffstat, Casville, Christian, Clifton, Clover, Danripple, Flagspring, Goresville, Groseclose, Howell, Mount Rush, Muse, Rapidan, Sequoia, Spears Mountain, Totier, Trappist, Unison, Warminster, and Yellowbottom.  Boden, Christian, Flagspring, Groseclose, Muse, Sequoia and Trappist soils have rock fragments of sedimentary rocks.  Boden soils have sandstone bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Braddock soils have red Bt horizons.  Buckhall soils formed in residuum that weathered from granite gneiss and schist of the Northern Piedmont Plateau.  Buffstat soils have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Casville soils formed in residuum from felsic or intermediate igneous and metamorphic rock.  Clifton soils formed in residuum weathered from intermediate and mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that are high in ferromagnesium minerals.  Clover soils formed in residuum from Triassic age materials.  Danripple soils formed on stream terraces in the Piedmont.  Goresville Rapidan, Spears Mountain, Totier, and Warminster soils are redder than 5 YR in the Bt.  Howell soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower part of the B horizon.  Mount Rush soils have a parlithic contact 20 and 40 inches.  .  Unison soils have rock fragments of dominantly rounded and subrounded greenstone and granodiorate.  Yellowbottom soils formed in residuum from sericite schist, phyllonite, phyllite, and metamonzagranite.  None of the competing series are underlain with feldspathic sands."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Quantico soils are on medium to broad drainage divides of the older coastal plain terraces.  Elevations generally range from about 150 to 350 feet.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  These soils developed in stratified fluvio-marine sediments that have a high content of feldspathic sands.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F."

The Fairfax soils are developed partly in Coastal Plain sediments and partly in residuum from piedmont rocks.  The Lunt soils have a higher content of shrink-swell clays.  The Neabsco soils have a fragipan in its subsoil."
