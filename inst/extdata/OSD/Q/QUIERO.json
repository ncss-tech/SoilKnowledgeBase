Bissel, Cowiche, Margerum, Orr, Ralls, Springmeyer, Truax, and Wenatchee soils are more than 40 inches deep. Bjork soils are mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Dodes and Noslo soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Indiano soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Madras soils contain 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper part of the profile.  Pahrange soils have 10 to 15 inches of soft weathered rock immediately above the hard bedrock. Simcoe soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon.  Uhaldi soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact."
