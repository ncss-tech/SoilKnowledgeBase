  "OVERVIEW": "The Quiero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite or basalt. They are on foothills and buttes. Permeability is slow. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Indiano soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Madras soils contain 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper part of the profile.  Pahrange soils have 10 to 15 inches of soft weathered rock immediately above the hard bedrock. Simcoe soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon.
