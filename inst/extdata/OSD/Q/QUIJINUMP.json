  "OVERVIEW": "The Quijinump series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Quijinump soils are on fan aprons and inset fans. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
