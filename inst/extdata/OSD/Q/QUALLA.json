These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to the aquic conditions and redox depletions with chroma of 2 ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 19 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 28 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent in the Ap, A and Bw horizons.  Depth to 2Btb horizon ranges from 25 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon (when present) has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw and the B part of the B/E horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is a loam or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E  and the E part of the E/B horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Btb1 and 2Btb2 horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The 2Btb horizon is clay loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam."
