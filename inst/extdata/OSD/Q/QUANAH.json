  "OVERVIEW": "The Quanah series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous slope alluvium and/or colluvium of Permian age. These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping base slopes and side slopes of hillslopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 610 to 660 mm (24 to 26 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
