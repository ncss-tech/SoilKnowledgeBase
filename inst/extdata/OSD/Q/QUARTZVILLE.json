  "OVERVIEW": "The Quartzville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from igneous tuffaceous rock.  Quartzville soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.",

The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches or more thick.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.  Stones range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and are from 0 to 10 percent below.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  The lower part contains 10 to 40 percent tuffaceous paragravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.
