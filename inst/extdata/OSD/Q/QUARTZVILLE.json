The soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the 4-month period following the summer solstice.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches or more thick.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.  Stones range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and are from 0 to 10 percent below.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  The lower part contains 10 to 40 percent tuffaceous paragravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, and contains 40 to 70 percent tuffaceous, paragravel."

These soils formed in fine textured colluvium weathered from tuffaceous igneous rock.  The soils have a humid temperate climate with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 190 days."
