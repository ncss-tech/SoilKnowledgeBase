Balon, Blancot and Gaddes soils have noncalcareous control sections. Bowbac, Cambria, Decolney, Forkwood, Hiland, Pokeman, Pugsley, Potts, Spangler and Teckla soils are cooler for longer periods following the winter solstice and are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Buckle soils formed in parent material derived from shale and sandstone and typically have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F. Redpen soils have hue redder than 7.5YR. Cerropelon, Cushman, Fattig, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest and Pokeman soils are moderately deep. Chilerojo soils are very deep to a densic horizon. Cumacho soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Doakum soils are less than 35 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and do not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations within the argillic. Fort soils have a soil moisture control section is moist intermittently during May and June and have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 54 degrees F. Mentmore, Palacid, Tamarindo, and Yenlo soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F. In addition, Tamarindo soils formed in parent material derived from sandstone and shale. Oelop soils have argillic horizons with a base less than 30 inches deep.  Penistaja soils contain greater than 40 percent sand in the control section. Sundance soils have a buried argillic horizon within 30 inches of the surface."
