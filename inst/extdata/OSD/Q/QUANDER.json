(Bt horizons)\nThe central concept of parent material, landforms, and soil moisture regime for the Quander series was narrowed November 1999.  The type location was moved to the Cochetopa SSA in Saguache County, Colorado to better reflect the current concept  All pedons previously correlated to the Quander series will need to be reevaluated for compatibility with the revised Quander series.\nThe possibility of a Vitrandic subgroup needs to be investigated, particularly where this soil is derived from tuff and breccia bedrock.\nTaxonomic version:  10th Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
