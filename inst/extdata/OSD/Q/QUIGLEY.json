  "REVDATE": "12/2012",
  "STATES": "MT,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Quigley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or till.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, stream terraces, hills, escarpments, till plains, outwash plains and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
