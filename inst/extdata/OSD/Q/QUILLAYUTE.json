Bear Prairie soils have weak structure in the B2 horizon, more than 5 percent base saturation in some part of the control section and 0.5 to 3 percent organic carbon at a depth of 40 inches.  Cinebar soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 18 inches thick and fine concretions in the upper part of the control section.  Lint soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.  Mossyrock soils have a xeric moisture regime, prismatic B2 horizon and are slightly acid or neutral in the control section.  Neskowin soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Newaukum soils have a xeric moisture regime, and an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and 15 to 30 percent hard rock fragments in the control section.  Salander soils have a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the control section.  Winema soils have more than 40 percent measured clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Quillayute soils are on river terraces at elevations of 80 to 350 feet.  They formed in loess and old estuary deposits.  The soils are in mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 85 to 120 inches.  The average January temperature is about 39 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 61 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 160 to 190 days."
