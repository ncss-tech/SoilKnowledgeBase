Mossyrock soils have a xeric moisture regime, prismatic B2 horizon and are slightly acid or neutral in the control section.  Neskowin soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Newaukum soils have a xeric moisture regime, and an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and 15 to 30 percent hard rock fragments in the control section.  Salander soils have a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the control section.  Winema soils have more than 40 percent measured clay in the control section."
