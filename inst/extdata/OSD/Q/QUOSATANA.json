  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is saturated with water during several months each year when not artificially drained. It is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The particle-size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Redox concentrations and depletions occur throughout. Soil reaction in the solum is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. Chroma of 3 extends to a depth of 6 inches or less. Texture is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. Thin discontinuous lenses of coarser material occur in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is stratified silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam with 25 to 45 percent clay. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Brenner, Chetco, Crump, Nestucca, and Willanch are soils in similar families. Crump soils have a histic epipedon. Brenner, Chetco, Nestucca and Willanch soils occur in the isomesic temperature zone. Willanch soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Brenner and Chetco soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quosatana soils occur in shallow swales and concave depressions on flood plains. Elevations are 15 to 750 feet. The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rock types. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost free period is 140 to 240 days."
