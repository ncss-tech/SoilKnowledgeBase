  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 80 inches. Depth to free carbonates is 20 to 60 inches.  The A horizons typically do not have rock fragments but the lower part in some pedons contains up to 5 percent by volume.  Some pedons have an 0 horizon as much as 6 inches in thickness. The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 22 and 35 percent clay and 7 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser. The soil moisture control section is not dry for 45 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 0. It has Fe concentrations in some pedons. Typically it is silty clay loam or silt loam throughout, but subhorizons of loam, or silty clay are included in the range. In some pedons the upper part has sufficient organic matter to be mucky. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nA Bg horizon when present is as much as 24 inches in thick in some pedons. It has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 0. Its range in texture and reaction is the same as the A horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly has distinct or prominent Fe depletions or concentrations. Texture is silt loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Cg horizon below a depth of 60 inches.  It has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly has distinct or prominent Fe depletions or concentrations. Texture is loam, or clay loam. It containes 1 to 8 percent rock fragments by volume. Reaction is slighlty alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Quam soils have plane or concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent in on flats an in swales and depressions (potholes and sloughs) in undulating to hilly end or ground moraines. They have primarily formed in silty water-sorted sediments and sometimes in the underlying calcareous, glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 22 to 29 inches. Frost-free days range from 120 to 160. Elevation above sea level ranges from 990 to 1950 feet."
