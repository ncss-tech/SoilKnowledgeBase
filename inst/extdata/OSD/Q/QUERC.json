Shale fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are between 2 mm. and one-fourth inch in size.\n2 - Querc Series\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; chroma of 1 or 2.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically a silty clay loam but may be clay loam or clay.  Clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent and has more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  Textures are normal clay loam or silty clay loam.  The shale fragments break down upon pre-treatment.  It is medium acid or slightly acid."

The Ashfork, Blackpipe, Boneek, Chapin, Collbran, Emigrant, Kube, Loma, Nunn, Rednun, Richfield, Ryus, Sofia, Savo, Torreon, and Wormser have free carbonates in the series control section or above 40 inches.  The Boneek, Collbran, Kube, Loma, Nunn, Rednun, Richfield, Ryus, Sofia, and Torreon soils lack a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  All the competing soils have reactions more alkaline than slightly acid."
