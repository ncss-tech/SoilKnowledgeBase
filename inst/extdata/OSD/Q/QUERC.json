  "OVERVIEW": "The Querc series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and slopewash derived from acid shale.  Querc soils are on lower hill and ridge slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

Depth to bedded shale is 20 to 40 inches.  Shale fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are between 2 mm. and one-fourth inch in size.\n2 - Querc Series\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; chroma of 1 or 2.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically a silty clay loam but may be clay loam or clay.  Clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent and has more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  Textures are normal clay loam or silty clay loam.  The shale fragments break down upon pre-treatment.  It is medium acid or slightly acid."
