  "REVDATE": "07/2013",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Quast series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from eolian deposits and alluvium, outwash or colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, outwash terraces, and hills. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
