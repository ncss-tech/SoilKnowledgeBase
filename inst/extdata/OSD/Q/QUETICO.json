  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock range from 4 to 10 inches. Texture of the material above the rock contact is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or gravelly and cobbly analogues. Content of gravel by volume ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Stones and boulders within or on the soil range from 0 to 3 percent. The gravel is dominantly granite or gabbro, but sandstone is included in a few places. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon from 1 to 3 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bs horizon contains at least 2 percent organic matter and typically is about 4 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils typically are on ridges of bedrock controlled ground moraines with convex slopes, but some are on plane to concave slopes. Slopes are both simple and complex. Slope gradients typically are from 2 to 18 percent but range to as much as 90 percent. These soils formed in 4 to 10 inch mantle of loamy glacial drift of Late Wisconsinan Age typically over igneous bedrock and in a few areas a sedimentary sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 30 inches."
