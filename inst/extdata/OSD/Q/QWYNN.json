  "OVERVIEW": "The Qwynn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and minor amounts of limestone. Qwynn soils are on inset fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
