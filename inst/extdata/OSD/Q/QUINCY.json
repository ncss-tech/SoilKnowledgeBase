  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 66 to 78 degrees F. These soils are moist in the winter and spring but are dry more than one half of the time the soil temperature exceeds 40 degrees F., about 105 to 130 consecutive days. These soils are dry in all parts between depths of 7 and 20 inches. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. Value is 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma is 1 to 4 moist or dry. Organic matter in the surface horizon when mixed is less than 1 percent. The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section ranges from sand to loamy fine sand. Less than 75 percent of the sand is very coarse, coarse, and medium if the clay content is less than 5 percent. If the clay content exceeds 5 percent, more than 75 percent of the sand fraction can be in the very coarse, coarse and medium size classes. The upper 15 inches of these soils is free of lime, except for small particles brought up by insects and animals. The matrix below 15 inches is noncalcareous in some pedons. Reaction in the upper 20 inches is slightly acid to moderately alkaline, and below 20 inches it is neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have unconforming materials, including coarse sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy fine sand, at depths below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quincy soils are on uplands, fan piedmonts and terraces, some having a ridged, hummocky, or dune microrelief. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. Many of the low rounded ridges are narrow and long. These soils formed in sands from mixed sources, but contains significant amounts of dark colored basaltic sand. Elevations are 150 to 2,800 feet in Washington and north-central Oregon, and 2,500 to 4,500 feet elsewhere. The climate is arid or semiarid and summers are dry. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 200 days in Washington and north-central Oregon, and 100 to 150 days elsewhere."

Burbank soils are sandy-skeletal and are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Cencove soils are coarse-loamy in the upper part and are on alluvial fans and terraces. Esquatzel and Warden soils are coarse-silty. Esquatzel soils are on bottomlands. Warden soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Feltham soils are finer than sandy in some part and are on terraces and alluvial fans. Hezel soils are sandy over loamy and are on dissected terraces and terrace escarpments. Taunton soils have a duripan, are coarse-loamy and are on terraces, basalt plains, and fan terraces. Quinton soils are on hillslopes, benches, and terraces."
