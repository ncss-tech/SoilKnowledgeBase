  "OVERVIEW": "The Quomus series consists of very deep, well drained soil that formed in loess and volcanic ash with minor amounts of colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Quomus soils are on hills and mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
