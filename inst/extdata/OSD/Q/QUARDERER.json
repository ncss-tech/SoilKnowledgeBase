  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 23 inches.  Depth to the Ab horizon ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  The particle size control section averages 10 to 17 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction typically  ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil but it ranges to neutral in the A horizons, where the soil is limed. Saturation occurs at 40 to 72 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 and typically is stratified with layers of different color.  Many pedons have thin strata of  finer or coarser textures in the C horizon. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btb horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is silt loam.\nThe C' horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam."

These soils formed in recently deposited dark colored silt loam alluvium 20 to 40 inches thick overlying a silty buried soil with a dark colored surface layer.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."

The well drained Dobie soils are in higher landscape positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of adjacent uplands.  The moderately well drained Doritty soils and the well drained Wickware soils are higher in the landscape on back slopes and foot slopes of adjacent valley sides.  The poorly and very poorly drained Vancecreek soils are in lower positions on the drainageways."
