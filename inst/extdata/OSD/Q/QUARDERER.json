  "OVERVIEW": "The Quarderer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silt loam alluvium over silty buried soils with dark colored surface horizons in drainageways.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The particle size control section averages 10 to 17 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction typically  ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil but it ranges to neutral in the A horizons, where the soil is limed. Saturation occurs at 40 to 72 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 and typically is stratified with layers of different color.  Many pedons have thin strata of  finer or coarser textures in the C horizon. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btb horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is silt loam.\nThe C' horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam."
