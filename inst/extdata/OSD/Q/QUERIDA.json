  "OVERVIEW": "The Querida series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Querida soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is typically fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent and are mainly pebbles.  The moisture control section is dry in most years in some part more than one-half the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  However, in most years it is moist in some part for 60 or more consecutive days during the growing season.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some C horizons have a few segregations of calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have gravelly loamy sand or loamy sand C horizons below a depth of 40 inches."

In addition, Grieves soils have only 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.\nTebbs soils have soil reactions that range to strongly alkaline and have soil moisture control sections that are usually dry in May and June and moist in some part in July, August, or September."
