  "OVERVIEW": "The Quartzburg series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic, quartz monzonite, granodiorite or related granitic rock. Quartzburg soils are on mountain slopes and canyon walls. Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and man annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
