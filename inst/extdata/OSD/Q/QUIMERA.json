  "OVERVIEW": "The Quimera series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Quimera soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes are l5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
