  "OVERVIEW": "The Quailprairie series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Quailprairie soils occur in open grassland areas on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and has 25 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and includes the upper portion of the Bw horizon.  High chroma redox concentrations occur below a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is gravelly loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Many medium to coarse distinct redox concentrations with high chroma occur throughout this horizon.  It is very gravelly silty clay, extremely gravelly silty clay, or very gravelly clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It has 30 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."
