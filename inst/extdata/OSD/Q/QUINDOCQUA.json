  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Quindocqua soils were previously mapped as the Othello series.  Quindocqua soils are differentiated from Othello by having a particle-size control section that is fine-loamy rather than fine-silty. The name Quindocqua is a variant transliteration of an Algonquian (Native American tribe) word for Quantico (Qundoxua) which means \"at the long inlet\".\nData for this pedon, S02MD039-008, indicate that there is a change in particle size distribution between the Btg3 and 2Btg4 horizons (silt--52% to 35%; sand--24% to 46%; fine sand--14% to 27%). This indicates the change between eolian and fluviomarine depositional environments. The change in particle size distribution between the 2Btg4 and 2Cg1 horizons (silt--35% to 13%; sand--46% to 83%; fine sand--27% to 51%; clay--20% to 3.4%) is significant, but does not indicate a major difference in mode of transport. Although a loam texture, the 2Bt4 horizon is approaching fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Ab horizon that has textures similar to the 2C and 2Cg horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap1, Ap2 and AE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 31 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 and 2Btg4 horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within all layers from the surface to 16 inches and have greater than 50% redoximorphic depletions with redox concentrations within the  upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nLithologic discontinuity at 23 inches (top of 2Btg4 horizon)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S02MD039-008 (National Soil Survey Laboratory, USDA-NRCS, Lincoln, NE).  Additional reference samples include samples numbers S00MD039-056-2, 6; S00MD039-087-1, 3; S00MD039-092-3, 4; S00MD039-093-1, 2,3; S00MD039-094-1, 2; S00MD039-190-2, 3; S00MD039-202-1, 3; S00MD039-205-1, 2 (University of Maryland, College Park, MD).\nData Map Unit ID: 400031\nRevised: 02/2002-SYD, AMH, JAK; 10/2005-SYD, AMH, DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
