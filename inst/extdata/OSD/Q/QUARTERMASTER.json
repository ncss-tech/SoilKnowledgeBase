  "OVERVIEW": "The Quartermaster series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone and basalt.  Slope is 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
