  "OVERVIEW": "The Quinn series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash on outwash plains. They are deep to sandy and gravelly outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
