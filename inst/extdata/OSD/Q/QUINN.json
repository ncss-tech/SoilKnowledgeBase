  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils in closely related families are the Morocco, Pinhook, and Tedrow series. Morocco and Tedrow soils do not have an argillic horizon and are mixed, mesic Aquic Udipsamments. Pinhook soils have an A horizon more than 15 cm (6 inches) thick with value of 3 or less and are coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Endoaqualfs."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quinn soils are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Quinn soils formed in outwash that is moderately high in shale and low in carbonates. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 965 mm (30 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

The Quinn soils are the poorly drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the moderately well drained Hanna soils and the well drained Tracy soils. The Alida, Coupee, Door, and Lydick soils formed in similar materials and are closely associated. The somewhat poorly drained Alida soils are on slightly higher swells. The well drained Coupee, Door, and Lydick soils are on higher lying swells, summits, and backslopes."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table is within 30 cm (1 foot) of the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy outwash and high or very high in the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash and rapid or very rapid in the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash."

Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S70IN-141-002) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T00IN-141-050) for the typical pedon is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 40 percent Quinn soils, 20 percent wet Alida soils, 30 percent Auten soils, and 10 percent Bourbon soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
