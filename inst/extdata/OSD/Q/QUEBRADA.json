    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to highly fractured unconsolidated rock ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 3. Content of pebbles ranges from 2 to 10 percent, by volume, and content of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, clay or their gravelly analogs.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3.  Texture is sandy clay loam.  Content of pebbles range from 0 to 2 percent, by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Content of pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of semi consolidated volcanic rock.  The upper part can be excavated easily with hand tools.  The lower part can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools and is rippable by mechanical equipment."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 68 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F."

All of these soils are on similar positions.  Caguabo soils are shallow to consolidated bedrock and do not have an argillic horizon.  Consumo soils are moderately deep. Humatas and Maraguez soils are very deep.  El Cacique (T) and La Taina (T) soils are shallow to serpentinite bedrock and have a mollic epipedon.  Morado and Mucara soils are moderately deep to bedrock and do not have an argillic horizon."

The classification was updated with the 06/2002 draft from Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Dystric Eutrudepts to Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Typic Hapludalfs based on the recognition of an argillic horizon.\nThis soil formed in the Rio Loco formation (Kl).\nQuebrada soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
