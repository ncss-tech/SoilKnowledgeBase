  "OVERVIEW": "The Quaking series consists of very deep, well drained soils  formed in tephra deposited over basaltic lava flows.  Quaking soils are on lava plateaus and escarpments.  Slope is 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
