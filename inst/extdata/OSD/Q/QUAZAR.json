  "OVERVIEW": "The Quazar series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium derived from volcanic rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, pediments, fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.",
