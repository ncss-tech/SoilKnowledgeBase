  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. The soils have an aridic moisture regime but are dry for less than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature is 41 degrees F. or higher and are moist during the winter. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The soils have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y and value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. Values below the C1 or Ap horizon in some pedons are lighter but the differences are less than 1 unit of value. The particle-size control section has a fine-earth texture of fine sand or loamy fine sand. Rock fragments in the lower part range from 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Less than 75 percent of the sand is of the very coarse, coarse and medium size classes if the clay content is less than 5 percent. If the clay content exceeds 5 percent, more than 75 percent of the sand fraction can be in the above mentioned size classes. In the upper 20 inches these soils are usually free of lime, except for small particles brought up by insects and animals; but the matrix below 20 inches is slightly effervescent in some pedons. Reaction in the upper 20 inches is neutral to slightly alkaline and below 20 inches it is neutral to moderately alkaline."
