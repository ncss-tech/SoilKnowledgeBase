  "OVERVIEW": "The Quichipa series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary and igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial flats and toeslopes of alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",

This soil is dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. It is usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 55 to 70 days during the 120 days following June 21.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 3 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam and clay above a depth of 40 inches, but includes loam, clay loam, silty clay loam and silty clay below this depth. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Ashdown and Calcross soils average less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and occur on alluvial fans upslope of the Quichipa soils. Kanarra soils have a mollic epipedon, an argillic and a calcic horizon, and occur on gently sloping fan terraces upslope of the Quichipa soils. Bullion soils have a natric horizon and are moderately saline to strongly saline below the natric horizon. They occur on alluvial plains in concave positions downslope of the Quichipa soils."
