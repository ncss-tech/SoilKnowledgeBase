  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F. Depth to shattered limestone and dolomite is 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments of gravel to stone size make up from 0 to 15 percent of the A and upper B horizon and from 15 to 20 percent of the lower B and the C horizons. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry, and chroma of 3 or 2. It has moderate or strong platy structure.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry, 4 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay and has a few pebbles in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 5 dry, 5 or 4 moist and chroma or 3 or 4. It is gravelly or very gravelly. This horizon has weak effervescence immediately above the bedrock in some pedons. It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Bear Basin, Hourglass, Sponsor, Swede, and Wildcow soils are more than 40 inches deep. McIntyre soils have albic horizons, and are strongly acid. Mult soils have an argillic horizon that extends to the lithic contact. Paintrock soils have Cca horizons.  Trapper soils have albic horizons and prominent Cca horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The underlying limestone is mainly the lower members of the Madison formation of the Mississippian Age. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from hard limestone. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 34 inches. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F."

Hanson soils lack an argillic horizon, are skeletal and have a calcic horizon. Mayflower soils have a thick mollic epipedon and lack an A2 horizon. Tropal soils have a calcic horizon and have a lithic contact with hard limestone at depths of less than 20 inches."
