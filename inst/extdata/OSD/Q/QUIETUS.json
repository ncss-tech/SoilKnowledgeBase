  "OVERVIEW": "The Quietus series consists of well drained, moderately deep to limestone soils on moderately steep and steep hills and valley sides at elevations of 7,000 to 9,000 feet. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from hard limestone. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 34 inches. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of gravel to stone size make up from 0 to 15 percent of the A and upper B horizon and from 15 to 20 percent of the lower B and the C horizons. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry, and chroma of 3 or 2. It has moderate or strong platy structure.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry, 4 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay and has a few pebbles in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 5 dry, 5 or 4 moist and chroma or 3 or 4. It is gravelly or very gravelly. This horizon has weak effervescence immediately above the bedrock in some pedons. It is neutral or slightly alkaline."
