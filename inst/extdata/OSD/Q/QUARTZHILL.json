  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quartzhill soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on backslope or shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks such as quartzite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,045 to 2,625 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
