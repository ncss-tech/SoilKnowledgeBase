Mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.   The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 20 to 50 percent for air-dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 3 to 5 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.  It has 5 to 12 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent organic mater.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum."
