  "OVERVIEW": "The Quitter series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 190 inches and average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.   The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties.

Acid oxalate extractable iron is 3 to 5 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.  It has 5 to 12 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent organic mater.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum."
