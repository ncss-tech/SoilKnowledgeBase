  "OVERVIEW": "The Quiburi series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed stream alluvium.  Quiburi soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
