    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall. Depth [SW2]to the Bt2 horizon ranges from 14 to 25 inches. Depth to aquic conditions is 12 to 24 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. The particle size control section averages 45 to 55 percent clay and 20 to 40 percent sand by weight in the fine earth fraction. Base saturation (by NH4 OAC) is estimated to range from 60 to 75 percent throughout the upper 43 inches of the profile.\nThe A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist. It averages 0 to 5 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam or l[SW3]oam and averages 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist. It averages 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist. It averages 0 to 20 percent gravel. Texture is clay, clay loam, [SW4]or gravelly clay."

Latah soils lack gravel throughout the profile, have an albic horizon that averages 12 to 18 inches in thickness and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Setnum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Tilma soils have a mollic epipedon 16 to 20 inches thick and have less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quicksell soils are in depressions on stream terraces on the east slopes of the Cascade Mountains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium from mixed sources with minor influence from glacial drift. [SW5]Elevations are 1,800 to 2,300 [SW6]feet. These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 [SW7]days."
