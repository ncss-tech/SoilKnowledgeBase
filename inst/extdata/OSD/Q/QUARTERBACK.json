  "OVERVIEW": "The Quarterback series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Quarterback soils are on terraces, floodplains, and in drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
