  "OVERVIEW": "The Quaker consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone and shale. Quaker soils occur on alluvial fans and alluvial flats, and alluvial plains and have slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.0 degrees C.",
