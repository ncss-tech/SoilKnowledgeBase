Loupence soils have a fine silty control section, are very deep, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon.  Bruncan, Harsan, Idow, Snowmore, and Schnipper soils have ochric epipedons.  Bruncan, Harsan, Idow, Snowmore, and Schnipper soils occur on basalt plains.  Loupence soils occur on the same landscape as the Quencheroo soil."
