  "OVERVIEW": "The Quezcan series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to shale and claystone. Quezcan soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale, claystone, and sandstone on backslopes of escarpments. Permeability is slow. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees.",

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (A horizon)\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at 27 inches.\nEntisol feature - The lack of diagnostic subsurface horizons; The Bk and BCk horizons do not qualify as a calcic horizon due to having less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nAridic subgroup - This soil has an Aridic Ustic soil moisture regime.\nThis soil has high shrink-swell properties in the subsurface horizons and morphological features that are marginal to those required for the Vertic subgroup of Ustorthents.  Cracks are present that are sometimes 5 mm or more wide, but slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates are not present.  This soil may qualify for the Vertic subgroup under the linear extensibility (LE) criterion, but it has not had the COLE values determined for the horizons above the paralithic contact.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined with a field volume calcimeter. Salinity values were determined with an Instant EC salinity meter.\nUpdates and revisions for the correlation of Kane County (UT642), July 2017, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
