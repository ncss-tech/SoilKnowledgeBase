    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quezcan soils are on backslopes of escarpments below mesas and cuestas. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Jurassic shale, claystone, and sandstone. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,540 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective storms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (A horizon)\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at 27 inches.\nEntisol feature - The lack of diagnostic subsurface horizons; The Bk and BCk horizons do not qualify as a calcic horizon due to having less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nAridic subgroup - This soil has an Aridic Ustic soil moisture regime.\nThis soil has high shrink-swell properties in the subsurface horizons and morphological features that are marginal to those required for the Vertic subgroup of Ustorthents.  Cracks are present that are sometimes 5 mm or more wide, but slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates are not present.  This soil may qualify for the Vertic subgroup under the linear extensibility (LE) criterion, but it has not had the COLE values determined for the horizons above the paralithic contact.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined with a field volume calcimeter. Salinity values were determined with an Instant EC salinity meter.\nUpdates and revisions for the correlation of Kane County (UT642), July 2017, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
