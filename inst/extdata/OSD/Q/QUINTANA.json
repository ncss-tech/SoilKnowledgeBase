  "OVERVIEW": "The Quintana series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from limestone, soft calcareous sandstone, and shale.  Quintana soils are on uplands, and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
