The lower part of the particle-size control section has 35 to 75 percent pumice.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 moist and chroma is 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizons have 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value is 3 to 5 moist, and chroma is 1 to 3 dry, and 2 to 6 moist.  Texture is paragravelly ashy sandy loam, paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, or paragravelly ashy loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value is 5 to 8 moist, and chroma is 4 to 6 dry, and 1 to 6 moist.

These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over granitic rock. The climate has warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22oF; the mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 39 to 41 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 100 to 140 days."
