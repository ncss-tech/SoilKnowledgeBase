  "OVERVIEW": "The Gany series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mountains. They formed in slope alluvium or colluvium from limestone. Slopes are 30 to 70 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
