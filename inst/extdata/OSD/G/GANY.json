  "OVERVIEW": "The Gany series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced colluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
