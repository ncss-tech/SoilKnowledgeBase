(B/E horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 29 inches.  (B/E, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with mudstone 31 inches.  (Cr layer horizons)\nThe type location is being moved to the Grand County Area, Colorado type location to better reflect the series concept, Jan. 2000.  In addition, the classification is being updated to Ustic Glossocryalfs from Typic Cryoboralfs.  The central concept is now narrowed to subalpine vegetation (Englemann's spruce, subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine).  Areas previously identified as Gateway whose dominant vegetation is ponderosa pine should be excluded from the current concept for the Gateway series.\n4/2001 classification was changed from Ustic to Eutric Glossocryalfs.  Precipitation was narrowed to exclude the less than 26 inches to limit this series to the typic-udic moisture regime.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
