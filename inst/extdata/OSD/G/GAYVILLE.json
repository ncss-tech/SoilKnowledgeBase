  "OVERVIEW": "The Gayville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey over loamy alluvium.  These soils are on bottomlands.  Permeability is very slow in the solum and moderate in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
