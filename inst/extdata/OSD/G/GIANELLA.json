  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Gianella soils are very deep and stratified. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C). The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, and has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Mineralogy is mixed.  This soil is noncalcareous throughout.  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth, and ranges from 4.0 at the surface to 0.34 percent to a depth of 83 inches, (211 cm).  A fluctuating water table can occur at depths of 33 to over 80 inches, (83 to 203 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through March.  Redoximorphic features such soft oxidized iron masses with colors of 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6 moist, may be present at a depth as high as 18 inches, (46 cm).  Redoxomorphic features may be present in the A horizon, especially if the horizon has platy structure.  Gravel on the surface ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Some pedons have Ab horizons commonly with textures of silt loam or loam.  Some pedons have gravelly substratums.\nThe A and Ap horizons dry color is 10YR 5/3, 6/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 or 2.5Y 3/3.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  Clay content ranges from 4 to 22 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sand or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gianella soils are on flood plains, primarily within the active meander belts of the Sacramento River and Feather River.  Most areas have been leveled for agriculture.  These soils formed in overbank deposited river alluvium from mixed rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Elevation is 70 to 175 feet, (21 to 53 m).  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches, (457 to 584 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost free season is 240 to 250 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; negligible runoff; moderate to moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity in the A and Ap horizons and moderate to rapid in the C horizons.  The soils are rarely to frequently flooded for brief periods in December through March.  A fluctuating water table can occur at depths of 33 to over 80 inches, (83 to 203 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through March.  Hydrology has been altered both from extensive leveling and by protection from frequent flooding by the Sacramento and Feather River levee systems."
