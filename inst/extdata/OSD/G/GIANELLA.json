  "OVERVIEW": "The Gianella series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in overbank deposited river alluvium from mixed rocks.  Gianella soils are on flood plains within the meander belt.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, and has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Mineralogy is mixed.  This soil is noncalcareous throughout.  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth, and ranges from 4.0 at the surface to 0.34 percent to a depth of 83 inches, (211 cm).  A fluctuating water table can occur at depths of 33 to over 80 inches, (83 to 203 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through March.  Redoximorphic features such soft oxidized iron masses with colors of 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6 moist, may be present at a depth as high as 18 inches, (46 cm).  Redoxomorphic features may be present in the A horizon, especially if the horizon has platy structure.  Gravel on the surface ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Some pedons have Ab horizons commonly with textures of silt loam or loam.  Some pedons have gravelly substratums.\nThe A and Ap horizons dry color is 10YR 5/3, 6/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 or 2.5Y 3/3.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  Clay content ranges from 4 to 22 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sand or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
