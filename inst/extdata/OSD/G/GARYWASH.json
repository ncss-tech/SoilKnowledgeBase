  "OVERVIEW": "The Garywash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite. Garywash soils are on fan remnants and slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 24 degrees C (about 75 degrees F).",
