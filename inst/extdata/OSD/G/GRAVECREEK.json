  "OVERVIEW": "The Gravecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from serpentinized rock. Gravecreek soils are on ridges and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 40 percent gravel, and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Dry value of 4 or 5 only occur in the upper part of the A horizon.  It has 10 to 25 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It is a gravelly loam, cobbly loam, or very cobbly loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 40 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It is a very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam."

The mean annual precipitation is typically 40 to 60 inches.  In the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation may range to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent."
