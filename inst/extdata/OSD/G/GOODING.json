Acoma soils have gravelly sandy clay argillic horizons and gravelly to extremely gravelly C horizons.  Berdugo and Spangenberg soils lack an E horizon and a calcic horizon.  Borda, Reba, and Sorf soils lack E horizons and lack cementation in the lower part of the profile.  Biscaro, Bowns, Hagata, Locey, Lodico, Mahala, and Verdico soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Brent soils lack bedrock above 60 inches and have less than 0.6 organic carbon content in some horizons above a depth of 10 inches. Chardoton soils have an MAST of greater than 52 degrees F.   Gariper and Poall soils lack E horizons.  Phing soils are moderately deep to a weak silica pan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gooding soils are on fan terraces and pediments on basalt plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,300 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium and loess from extrusive rocks, volcanic ash, and lacustrine sources.  The soils are in a semi arid climate with annual precipitation of 9 to 13 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days."
