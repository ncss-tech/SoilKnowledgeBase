  "OVERVIEW": "The Gooding series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and loess. Gooding soils are on alluvial fan terraces on basalt plains and buttes.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Acoma soils have gravelly sandy clay argillic horizons and gravelly to extremely gravelly C horizons.  Berdugo and Spangenberg soils lack an E horizon and a calcic horizon.  Borda, Reba, and Sorf soils lack E horizons and lack cementation in the lower part of the profile.  Biscaro, Bowns, Hagata, Locey, Lodico, Mahala, and Verdico soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Brent soils lack bedrock above 60 inches and have less than 0.6 organic carbon content in some horizons above a depth of 10 inches. Chardoton soils have an MAST of greater than 52 degrees F.   Gariper and Poall soils lack E horizons.  Phing soils are moderately deep to a weak silica pan."
