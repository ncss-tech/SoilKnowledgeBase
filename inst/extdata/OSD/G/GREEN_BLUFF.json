  "OVERVIEW": "The Green Bluff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Green Bluff soils are on outwash plains over basalt plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Total thickness of the lamellae in the E&Bt horizons is less than 6 inches\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 17 inches (Ap and E&Bt1 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the E&Bt1, the E&Bt2, and the upper part of the E&Bt3 horizon)\nSeries reclassified from Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Xerochrepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts 10/01.\nThe description for the type location has been revised 03/03 based on revisiting the pedon type location and developing a more complete pedon description.  The series was also reclassified from Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts to Coarse-loamy isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts to reflect the correct temperature regime.  Green Bluff soils are also mapped in Stevens County with similar vegetation.\nGreen Bluff soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed)."
