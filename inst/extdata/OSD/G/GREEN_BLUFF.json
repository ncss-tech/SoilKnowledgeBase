  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Green Bluff soils are on outwash plains over basalt plateaus at elevations of 1,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 135 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nLamellae - the zone from 7 to 55 inches (E&Bt horizons). Total thickness of the lamellae in the E&Bt horizons is less than 6 inches\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 17 inches (Ap and E&Bt1 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the E&Bt1, the E&Bt2, and the upper part of the E&Bt3 horizon)\nSeries reclassified from Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Xerochrepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts 10/01.\nThe description for the type location has been revised 03/03 based on revisiting the pedon type location and developing a more complete pedon description.  The series was also reclassified from Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts to Coarse-loamy isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts to reflect the correct temperature regime.  Green Bluff soils are also mapped in Stevens County with similar vegetation.\nGreen Bluff soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Number: 68WA063001 Spokane County, WA.
