  "REVDATE": "10/98",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glendo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from siltstone and fine grained sandstone on alluvial fans, terraces and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Glendo soils are typically effervescent throughout but may be leached as deep as 10 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  The particle size control section averages 70 to 85 percent silt, 5 to 18 percent clay, and 5 to 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  The moisture control section is usually dry.  It is usually moist in April May and early June and dry for 60 days or more during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon with the same basic properties as the Bw horizon.  it is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10Yr, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  The reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
