The Bailegap, Jefferson, Lonewood, and Riney soils have a solum ranging from 40 to 60 inches and do not have soft bedrock from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils also have sandstone rock fragments.  Lily soils have rock fragments of sandstone and hard sandstone bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Marr, Sassafras, and Sunnyside soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock and are formed in coastal plain segments.  They also have sandy textures and rounded quartzite gravel in the particle size or series control section."
