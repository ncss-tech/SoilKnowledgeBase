  "REVDATE": "10/2002",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gardners Fork series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from quartz diorite porphyry and shale.  Gardners Fork soils are on mountain slopes and benches, and have slopes of 20 to 55 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or deeper. The control section averages 20 to 35 percent shale fragments. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout the soil. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is channery light loam, heavy sandy loam or silt loam. Shale fragment content ranges from 20 to 30 percent in the upper part of the A horizon, 20 to 50 percent in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 35 to 60 percent shale fragments."
