Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or deeper. The control section averages 20 to 35 percent shale fragments. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout the soil. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is channery light loam, heavy sandy loam or silt loam. Shale fragment content ranges from 20 to 30 percent in the upper part of the A horizon, 20 to 50 percent in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 35 to 60 percent shale fragments."

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from quartz diorite porphyry and shale. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 47 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F. The frost-free period is 20 to 50 days. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches."
