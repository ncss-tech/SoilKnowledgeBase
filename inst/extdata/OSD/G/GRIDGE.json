  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sandstone occurs at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent clay and rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and commonly are angular gravel and less commonly cobbles and stones.  About 5 to 10 percent angular stones occur on the surface.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture\ncontrol section for 50 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 4 months following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 6 to 8 dry.  Rock fragment content ranges from 20 to\n35 percent, with 15 to 25 percent as gravel, 0 to 10 percent as cobbles,\nand 5 to 10 percent as stones.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nand chroma of 6 to 8 dry and moist.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly gravelly silt loam, loam or gravelly loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gridge soils are found on stream cut canyon walls and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 25 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sandstone\nand conglomerate.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 7,400 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is from 13 to 18 inches.  Freeze-free period is 55 to 80 days."

(A horizon)\nLithic contact - the boundary at approximately 17 inches.  (R horizon)\nCalcareous feature -the fine-earth fraction effervesces in all parts with cold dilute HCL.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
