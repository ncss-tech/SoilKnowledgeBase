  "OVERVIEW": "The Glorieta series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Glorieta soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of scarps and hills. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
