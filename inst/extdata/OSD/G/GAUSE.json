  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Base saturation in the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 74 percent.  Some pedons contain up to 10 percent by volume of siliceous pebbles and fragments of ironstone that are less than 5 cm across.\nThe combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, yellow and brown.  Texture is clay, sandy clay or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through medium acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6, or is mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray.  Textures are clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid."

The Birome, Bonti, Castell, Darst, Jedd, Rosanky, Shatruce and Travis soils have dominant hues redder than 7.5YR in the argillic horizon and have epipedons that average less than 12 inches thick.  Spiller soils do not contain siliceous pebbles and are formed from interbedded shaly sediments mainly of the Cook Mountain Geologic Formation.  Chazos and Rader soils have low chroma mottles due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface.\nTabor soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and are in a vertic subgroup."

These soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvial sediments.  The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 32 to 40 inches, and Thornthwaite PE indices of 52 to 64 inches.  The mean average temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F."

The Chazos and Rader soils are in concave positions and have gray mottles due to wetness.  The Silawa and Travis soils are in similar positions, but have redder hues in the argillic horizon.  In addition, Silawa soils are loamy."
