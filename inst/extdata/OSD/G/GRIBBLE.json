The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It is cobbly clay loam, cobbly silty clay loam or cobbly loam. This horizon has weak platy to moderate granular and very fine and fine subangular blocky structure.  It has 10 to 25 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Btss and Btkss horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very cobbly clay or silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay and has moderate or strong blocky or subangular blocky structure.  It has 20 to 35 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Btk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.
