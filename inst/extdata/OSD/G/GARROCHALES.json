  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Garrochales series consists of deep, poorly drained organic soils formed in sediments of highly and partially decomposed plant tissues and marl.  They occur on nearly level, depressional areas and bottomlands.  The Garrochales soils have black, friable, organic layers over marl.",

They are slightly sticky and slightly plastic throughout.\nThe Ap horizons are black, friable, granular, with low mineral content and less than 5 percent fiber.\nThe subsurface organic layers have colors in hues of 10YR, values of 2 and 3, and chroma of 1 and 2.  The unrubbed fiber content varies from 30 to 60 percent.  The rubbed fiber content varies from 10 to 15 percent.\nThe marly layers consist of silt loam or loams, calcareous material and light gray to white."
