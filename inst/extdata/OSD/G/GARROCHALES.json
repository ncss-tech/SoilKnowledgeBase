They are slightly sticky and slightly plastic throughout.\nThe Ap horizons are black, friable, granular, with low mineral content and less than 5 percent fiber.\nThe subsurface organic layers have colors in hues of 10YR, values of 2 and 3, and chroma of 1 and 2.  The unrubbed fiber content varies from 30 to 60 percent.  The rubbed fiber content varies from 10 to 15 percent.\nThe marly layers consist of silt loam or loams, calcareous material and light gray to white."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Tiburones, Palmas Altas, and Saladar series are similar soils in related families.  They do not have marly layers in their profiles.  The Tiburones soils have lower unrubbed fiber content.  The Saladar soils have higher rubbed fiber and content and are more alkaline."

They formed in the sediments of partially decomposed plant residual under wet conditions over marl.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 60 to 70 inches and the average annual temperature is 78 degrees F."
