  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise state the depths in this paragraph are measured from the mineral surface.) Thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 24 inches.    Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the solum and from 30 to 50 percent in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 7 percent in the solum and from 10 to 30 percent in the substratum.  Total rock fragment in the particle size control section averages from 35 to 60 percent. Rock fragments are dominantly limestone, but some are granitic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR,  7.5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. Some pedons have Bs horizons.  Where present, they have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly analogs of sand or coarse sand."

The Brownstone soils have lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Colton, Grotto, Hermon, Marblemount, Masardis, Sheepscot, Stetson, Teneriffe and Waiska soils do not contain free carbonates within 60 inches. In addition all of these soils, except Waiska are in areas receiving more than 32 inches of mean annual precipitation."

Emmet soils are coarse-loamy and have fewer rock fragments. Kalkaska soils are very deep, sandy soils. Posen soils are loamy- skeletal and have more rock fragments.  The somewhat poorly drained Solona soils are in lower landscape positions."
