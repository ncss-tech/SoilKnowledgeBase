  "OVERVIEW": "The Guaynaka series consists of very shallow and shallow to unweathered bedrock, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic breccia.  Guaynaka soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Atascosa soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR and formed on rhyolitic conglomerate and rhyolitic tuff.  Costavar soils are moderately alkaline and have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 2 to 10 percent.  Silktassel soils formed in colluvium derived from tuff and have more than 60 percent coarse fragments. Woodcutter soils have hue yellower than 5YR and formed on granite, granodiorite, and gneiss."

The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.
