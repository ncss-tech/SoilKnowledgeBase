Atascosa soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR and formed on rhyolitic conglomerate and rhyolitic tuff.  Costavar soils are moderately alkaline and have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 2 to 10 percent.  Silktassel soils formed in colluvium derived from tuff and have more than 60 percent coarse fragments. Woodcutter soils have hue yellower than 5YR and formed on granite, granodiorite, and gneiss."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic breccia.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
