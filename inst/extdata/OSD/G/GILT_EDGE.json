  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilt Edge series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic, mesic family of Ustollic Natrargids.  These soils have light colored loam A2 horizons, grayish brown clay B2t horizons, and C horizons at depths of less than 2 feet that have large accumulations of calcium carbonate and gypsum.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Gilt Edge soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches when soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F., but they are not dry in all parts above 12 inches during this period for more than half the time.  Mean annual soil temperature is more than 47 degrees F.  Total thickness of the A2 horizon ranges from 5 to 8 inches.  The Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value greater than 5 dry and greater than 3.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The surface layer is loam or silt loam.  The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of ped coats is 2 or 3 and of crushed peds mainly 3 or 4.  The B2t horizon contains from 50 to 60 percent clay, dominantly of montmorillonitic type.  It has columnar structure that can be broken with difficulty into fine blocks.  It contains less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and more exchangeable sodium plus magnesium than calcium plus hydrogen.  In some pedons the Cca horizon is indistinct and contains only a few threads of lime.  The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  Some part of the C horizon contains 15 percent or more exchangeable sodium.  The IIC horizon of very gravelly loam is lacking in some pedons.  Texture of the C horizon below the depth of 40 inches is not definitive for the series and any texture is permitted below this depth."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 49 degrees F., mean annual precipitation from 10 to 14 inches, and the freeze-free period from 95 to 120 days.  Precipitation from April through October is 8 to 12 inches."
