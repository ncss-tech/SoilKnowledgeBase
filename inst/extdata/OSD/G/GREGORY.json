The soils are usually moist but are dry at depths between 4 to 12 inches for 70 to 100 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  Depth to weathered bedrock is 40 to over 60 inches.  A seasonal water table occurs at a depth of 0 to 1 feet from December through May.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  The mollic epipedon is 23 to 35 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay or clay loam.  Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.  It is medium to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam."

All of these soils lack the 70 to 100 consecutive day dry period during the summer months.  Bremer soils have chroma of 1 or less throughout a depth of 24 to 36 inches from the surface.  Chancellor soils have carbonates at a depth of 25 to 50 inches and have accumulations of gypsum and other salts in the lower part of the subsoil, in most pedons.  Crossplain soils have carbonates at a depth of 16 to 48 inches and has chroma of 1 or less throughout the A horizon.  Edinburg soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 24 inches thick.  Haig soils have chroma of 1 or less throughout the mollic epipedon.  Mazaska soils have carbonates at a depth of 30 to 60 inches, and have a mollic epipedon 10 to 22 inches thick.  Minnetonka soils have carbonates at a depth of 28 to 52 inches and have chroma of 1 or less throughout the A horizon.  Taintor soil have a mollic epipedon 12 to 24 inches thick.  Winterset soils have chroma of 1 or less throughout the A horizon.  Worthenton soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 20 inches thick and are effervescent throughout the profile.  Worthing soils have carbonates at a depth of 35 to 60 inches, have chroma of 1 or less throughout the A horizon and Bt horizon, and have a mollic epipedon over 35 inches thick."

The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F; the mean winter temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 69 to 72 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
