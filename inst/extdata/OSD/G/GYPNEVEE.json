  "OVERVIEW": "The Gypnevee series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from gypsum or gypsiferous siltstone.  Gypnevee soils are on ridges and hillslopes on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
