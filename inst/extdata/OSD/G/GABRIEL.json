  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches. The mollic epipedon is 21 to 30 inches thick. The particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, but individual horizons can have up to 39 percent clay. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon commonly has color similar to the A horizon. The lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron masses with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6 are few or common. The Btg horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and ranges to silty clay below the particle-size control section, and may have up to 35 percent gravel below 40 inches. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a very gravelly 2Btg horizon that is similar in color and reaction to the Btg horizon."

Sturkie soils do not have Bg horizons and are on lower flood plains. Racket soils have more sand and gravel in the subsoil and are also on lower flood plains. Moniteau soils have a lighter colored surface layer and are on similar positions."
