  "OVERVIEW": "The Getaway series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and colluvium from basalt, andesite, or andesitic basalt with an influence of volcanic ash mixed in the surface. Getaway soils are on mountain side slopes and canyon walls. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils formed in loess and colluvium from basalt, andesite, or andesitic basalt with an influence of volcanic ash mixed in the surface. Elevation typically ranges from 2,800 to 5,000 feet but may range to 6,000 feet on south slopes. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation typically is 17 to 30 inches but may range to 40 inches in some areas.  The average January temperature is about 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 63 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.
