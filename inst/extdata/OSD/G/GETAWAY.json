  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Getaway soils are on mountain side slopes and canyon walls and have slopes of 15 to 90 percent. These soils formed in loess and colluvium from basalt, andesite, or andesitic basalt with an influence of volcanic ash mixed in the surface. Elevation typically ranges from 2,800 to 5,000 feet but may range to 6,000 feet on south slopes. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation typically is 17 to 30 inches but may range to 40 inches in some areas.  The average January temperature is about 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 63 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."
