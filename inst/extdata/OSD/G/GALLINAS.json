  "OVERVIEW": "The Gallinas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from upland soils formed on Cretaceous bedrock plateau. Gallinas soils occur along stream terraces within plateau river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and mean annual soil temperature is about 11.7 degrees C.",
