Celeridge and Loope soils have mollic epipedons that are 36 to 50 cm thick, are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks.  Gabica, Grandeposit, Mattier, Realmcoy, and Tweener soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Gerdog soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks, and have mean summer soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C.  Gidwin soils have mollic epipedons that are 36 to 50 cm thick and that includes all of the argillic horizon and have rock fragments that are basalt.  Hawkridge soils are dominated by gravel, average 14 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks.  Hutchley soils have rock fragments that are quartz latite, basalt, or related volcanic rocks.  Melling soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Pernog soils are dominated by stones, average 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are quartzite, shale, chert, welded tuff, and rhyolite.  Rozara soils are dominated by fine gravel, have 14 to 18 percent clay, and average 45 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Shalcleav soils are dominated by channers and flagstones, are 10 to 30 cm to a lithic contact, and have rock fragments that are tuff, rhyolite, chert, or argillite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Genoa soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on convex summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived from granitic and some metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,445 to 2,900 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 430 mm and comes mainly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 75 days."

Local soil temperature data indicates this soil has mean summer soil temperatures in the range of the frigid temperature regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 48 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 48 cm to hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 48 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
