Birdow soils are calcareous throughout.  Blackrock soils contain 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Coit soils have redoximorphic features at depths of 11 to 25 inches and are calcareous throughout.  Dagor soils lack buried A horizons.  Eastcan soils have redoximorphic features at depths of 24 to 40 inches and are calcareous throughout.  Goose Creek soils have redoximorphic features below 24 inches and have a water table at 30 to 42 inches.  Gosinta soils lack buried A horizons and have a water table at 2 to 4 feet.  Lakeview soils lack buried A horizons and contain a component of volcanic ash.  Monroe soils have an average summer soil temperature greater than 66 degrees F. and an aridic soil moisture regime.  Oxy soils are moderately deep. Shoepeg soils have redoximorphic features at 20 to 36 inches and are somewhat poorly drained.  Soquel soils have an average annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F. and are medium acid to neutral throughout.  Willowdale soils have 10 to 20 percent pumice sand in the control section and are calcareous at 20 inches or less."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches, the average annual air temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. and the frost free period is 110 to 130 days."
