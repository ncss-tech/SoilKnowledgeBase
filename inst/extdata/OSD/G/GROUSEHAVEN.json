  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grousehaven soils are in depressions and drainageways on outwash plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in highly decomposed organic soil materials from herbaceous plants overlying marly materials in slow moving or standing water. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 762 mm (24 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.6 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Nester soils and somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils are on the upland surrounding the Grousehaven soils. Lupton and Cathro soils formed in thicker organic deposits and are in similar areas adjacent to the Grousehaven soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface at some time during normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the surface layer and slow or very slow in the marl."
