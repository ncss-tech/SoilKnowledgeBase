  "OVERVIEW": "The Guero series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material from old glacial drift.  These soils are on plateaus, mesas, hilltops, and sideslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

The Burnette, Paulson, and Fulcher series have a consistent k horizon above 40 inches.   In addition, the Fulcher soil has a moisture control section that is dry in most parts when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Cochetopa soils have rock fragments that are dominantly stones.  Faim soils have less than 35% clay in the BC or C horizons.  Friana soils are deep with cindery clay above 40 inches, and are formed in mixed sediments from ash, cinders, and basalt.  The Grouseville soil has a soil reaction of mildly or moderately alkaline in the Bt and the moisture control section is dry in most parts about half the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  The Luna soils are formed in ash and Tuff, and have a paralithic layer above 40 inches.  The dMancos and Richens soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Mayflower and Skutum soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  The Perinos soils have hues of 5YR and redder in the Bt horizon.  The slights and Toponce soils have a moderately acid soil reaction in the Bt horizon.  The Sudduth soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 12 to 24 inches.  Sudpeak soils are moderately well drained with a water table at depth.  The Teedown soils have moisture control sections that are usually moist when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F."
