  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldbutte series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from gneiss, schist and granite. Goldbutte soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches; mean annual air temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
