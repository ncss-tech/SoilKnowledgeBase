  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldbutte soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from gneiss, schist and granite. Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches; mean annual air temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
