  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Carbonates occur within 15 inches of bedrock contact in most pedons. Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent in the control section. Rock fragments, primarily of sandstone and dolomitic limestone, range from 5 to 25 percent by volume in the solum. Rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent in the substratum and consist primarily of argillite with some dolomitic limestone. The average rock fragment content is less than 35 percent in the control section. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper solum and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower solum and substratum.\nThe Ap has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Some undisturbed A horizons have value and chroma one unit lower than the Ap horizon. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction, and less commonly silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderately platy or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2Cr horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction between weathered bedrock fragments is loam or silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Camillus series is in the same family. Camillus soils are underlain by calcaerous shale and contains less than 15 percent hard rock fragements throughout the soil. The Hennepin series was in the same family, but has not been classified for CEC activity class. Hennepin soils have a thinner solum and are greater than 40 inches to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gardenisle soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on glacial till uplands. They are on ridges and sideslopes controlled by interbedded and slightly folded argillite (indurated calcareous mudstone), dolomitic limestone and limestone bedrock. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The till parent material is derived mainly from dolomitic limestone and sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 36 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F.; and the frost free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 100 to 300 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The shallow Benson soils are on similar landscapes, and the Amenia, Kingsbury, Massena, Northway (T), and Rhinebeck soils are on nearby landscapes. The Amenia and Massena soils are very deep to bedrock and formed in loamy glacial till. The Northway soils are very deep outwash sand overlying loamy glacial till. The Kingsbury and Rhinebeck soils are somewhat poorly drained clayey soils on lake plains."
