  "OVERVIEW": "The Grandfield series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium, and eolian sediments of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils occur on stream terraces on alluvial plains in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) and Central Limestone Prairies (MLRA 78A). Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",
