Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent with about one-third of the rock fragments being stones and boulders.  Visible lime is at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, with values of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, with values of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  It is noneffervescent in the upper part, but the Btk is strongly effervescent in segregates.  Textures are clay loam and clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent."
