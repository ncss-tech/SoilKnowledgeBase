  "OVERVIEW": "The Golime series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial deposits derived dominantly from basalt with lesser influence from shale and sandstone.  Golime soils are on till plains.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
