Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture averages clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Thin strata with textures of loamy fine sand to clay are present in most pedons. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

The somewhat poorly drained Alango, poorly drained Indus soils and very poorly drained Woodslake soils are on higher lying positions on lake plains. The very poorly drained Dora soils formed in organic materials over clayey sediments and are closely associated in lower lying depressions. The moderately well drained Taylor soils are on nearby sideslopes or convex surfaces of lake plains."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is .42 to 1.41 micrometers per second (.06 to .2 inches per hour). Seasonal high saturation is at the surface sometime during spring and fall in normal years. The very poorly drained phase is subject to ponding. Frequent flooding occurs at some time during the months of April through June in years of normal precipitation."
