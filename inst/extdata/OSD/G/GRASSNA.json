    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon typically is more than 30 inches thick but ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and 2 moist.  It typically is silt loam, but, some is silty clay loam, loam or clay loam with 10 to 30 percent very fine sand.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In the lower part, it has hue of 2.5Y in of some pedons.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have BC, BCk or 2Bk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, but, coarser or finer textures are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have visible gypsum in the lower part.  Some pedons have Ab horizons below 50 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grassna soils are on concave, level to gently sloping swales, fans, and foot slopes mainly on silt mantled uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  The soil formed in silty sediments.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches.  About three-fourths of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Bowbells, Linton, Morton, Sen, Temvik and Wilton soils are on convex uplands adjacent to the Grassna soils.  Mandan soils are on nearby terraces and uplands nearer to the source of loess.   Williams soils on nearby glacial till uplands.  Bowbells and Williams have argillic horizons and are fine-loamy.  Linton and Mandan soils are coarse-silty.  In addition, the Linton soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Morton soils have argillic horizons.  Sen soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick and soft siltstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Temvik soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick, and in addition, have glacial till within depths of 20 to 40 inches."

Grassna soils receive some runoff from higher lying uplands.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3.5 to 5.0 feet at some time during the period of April through June in the moderately well drained phase.  It is at a depth of 4 to more than 6 feet during the same period in the well drained phase."
