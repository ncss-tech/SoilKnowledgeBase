Williams soils on nearby glacial till uplands.  Bowbells and Williams have argillic horizons and are fine-loamy.  Linton and Mandan soils are coarse-silty.  In addition, the Linton soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Morton soils have argillic horizons.  Sen soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick and soft siltstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
