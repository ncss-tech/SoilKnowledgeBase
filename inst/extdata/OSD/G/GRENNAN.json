  "OVERVIEW": "The Grennan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from proglacial lake deposits and continental glacial till on low relief, dissected uplands.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The presence of the albic materials and redox features in the upper horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on the color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will classify as aquic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts."
