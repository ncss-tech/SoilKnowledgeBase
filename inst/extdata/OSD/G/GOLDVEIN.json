  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Goldvein series are very deep and moderately well drained with slow to moderately slow permeability.  They formed on uplands in residuum weathered from quartz monzonite, pegmatites, muscovite and biotite granites.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
