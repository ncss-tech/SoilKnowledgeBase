  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 5 to 20 percent in the A horizon, from 35 to 50 percent in the Btx and from 15 to 20 percent in the BCt horizon.  These consist of angular quartz fragments 2 to 5 mm in diameter.  The soil is extremely acid or very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E and EB horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam and dominantly their fine gravelly analogues.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is dominantly very gravelly silt loam but include gravelly loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Structure is weak platy and slightly brittle.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8 and is mottled in shades of gray, yellow and brown.  It is fine gravelly clay loam, fine gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8, with common mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red and a few gray mottles.  It is fine gravelly loam, fine gravelly sandy clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red and gray.  It is commonly fine gravelly clay loam or fine gravelly sandy loam."

Beltsville, Belvoir, Bourne, Brewton, Calverton, Colfax, Glenville, Nixa, Ora, Paraloma, Pheba, Savannah and Vaucluse soils are in closely related families.  Beltsville, Belvoir, Bourne, Brewton, Calverton, Colfax, Glenville, Ora, Pheba, Savannah and Vaucluse soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  The Nixa and Paraloma soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 40 cm of the surface of the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldvein soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands of the northern Piedmont Plateau.  Slope gradients are commonly between 2 to 7 percent with a range of 0 to 15 percent.  The regolith is residuum weathered from acid rocks such as coarse grained quartz monzonite, pegmatites, muscovite and biotite granites.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 degrees to 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 45 inches."
