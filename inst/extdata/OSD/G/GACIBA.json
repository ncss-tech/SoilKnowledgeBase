  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaciba series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from extrusive igneous rock.  Gaciba soils are on mountains, lava plains, and foothills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Anaud soils have 25 to 34 percent clay in the control section and 30 to 38 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Bellenmine soils have a paralithic contact at 6 to 14 inches in depth above the lithic contact.  Cleavage soils do not have mollic epipedons that extend into the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Cropper soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Gabica soils have 18 to 25 inches of annual precipitation, A xeric moisture regime, and are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days.  Hutchley soils have 24 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Mascamp soils have sandy clay loam textures in the argillic horizons and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Pernty and Poisoncreek soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Shalcleav soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the control section and have hard bedrock at 4 to 12 inches.  Shalper soils are 4 to 12 inches to bedrock and have 24 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Tweener soils are 7 to 12 inches to bedrock and have mainly cobbles and stones as rock fragments in the control section."
