Anaud soils have 25 to 34 percent clay in the control section and 30 to 38 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Bellenmine soils have a paralithic contact at 6 to 14 inches in depth above the lithic contact.  Cleavage soils do not have mollic epipedons that extend into the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Cropper soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Gabica soils have 18 to 25 inches of annual precipitation, A xeric moisture regime, and are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days.  Hutchley soils have 24 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Mascamp soils have sandy clay loam textures in the argillic horizons and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Pernty and Poisoncreek soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Shalcleav soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the control section and have hard bedrock at 4 to 12 inches.  Shalper soils are 4 to 12 inches to bedrock and have 24 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Tweener soils are 7 to 12 inches to bedrock and have mainly cobbles and stones as rock fragments in the control section."

The soils formed in residuum, lava plains, and slope alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches.  Average summer air temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 45 to 90 days."
