  "OVERVIEW": "The Great Bay series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils in bays and coves within estuaries of the  northeast. The Great Bay soils are formed in silty estuarine deposits overlying clayey glaciomarine deposits. These soils are in intertidal areas or are continuously inundated in salt or brackish water. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are continuously inundated or may be exposed to the atmosphere during periods of low tide. Depth to lithologic discontinuity (glaciomarine deposits) is less than 1 meter. Initial pH ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline, and oxidized pH ranges from ultra-acid through neutral. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.6 dS/m throughout the profile. Sulfur odor ranges from strong to non-detectable.\nThe Ase horizon, and ACse  where present, has hue of 2.5Y, 2.5GY, 5GY, 5Y, 10Y, or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2; or is neutral with value of 2 through 5. Texture is silt loam. Thin horizons of fine sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or sand  occur in some pedons. Consistence is typically very fluid. Gravel content is 0 through 10 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 40 percent. Herbaceous plant fibers and wood fragments may be present.\nThe Cseg horizon, and Cg where present, has hue of 5GY, 5Y, or 10Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1. Texture is typically silt loam, but silty clay loam may be present. Thin horizons of fine sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or sand occur in some pedons. Consistence is typically moderately fluid. Gravel content is 0 through 10 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 40 percent. Herbaceous plant fibers and wood fragments may be present.\nThe 2Cg horizon, and 2Cse where present, have hue of 5BG, 5PB, 5G, 5GY, 5Y, 10BG, or 10Y, value of 2.5 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2; or is neutral with value of 2.5 through 5. They are typically silty clay loam or silty clay, however, may include silt loam and thin strata of loamy very fine sand or fine sand. Consistence is nonfluid and often firm. Gravel content is 0 through 2 percent. Redoximorphic features may be present, some pedons have angular blocky structure."
