Depth to free carbonates ranges from 41 to more than 152 centimeters (16 to more than 60 inches). Depth to sand or gravel is 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loamy sand, sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues and contains up to 65 percent gravel. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beotia, Brookings, Graceland, Overly, and Waubay series. Beotia and Overly soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. Brookings soils have glacial till within a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) Graceland and Waubay soils have glacial till at a depth greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches). The Waubay soils also have strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 mm to 50 mm in thickness."
