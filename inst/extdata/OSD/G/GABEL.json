  "OVERVIEW": "The Gabel series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff with eolian deposits. Gabel soils are on foothills. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
