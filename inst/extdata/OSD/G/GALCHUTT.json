  "OVERVIEW": "The Galchutt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial lake sediments that are silty in the upper part and clayey in the lower part.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 20 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It typically is silt loam, but it is loam, fine sandy loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Faint redoximorphic features having chroma of 2 or higher are in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam. It is neutral.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many, fine to large, and faint to prominent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or clay and averages between 45 and 60 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many, fine to large, and faint to prominent.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure and moderate or strong fine or very fine angular blocky structure.  In some pedons tongues of A horizon extend into the 2Bt horizon.  The lower part of the 2Bt has slight to strong effervescence and carbonates are diffused through the soil or in masses.  Some pedons do not have carbonates in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay and has massive, laminated, or weak or moderate grades of blocky structure.  It is slightly alkaline.  It has few to common accumulations of carbonates in many pedons.  Numerous distinct or prominent redoximorphic features make the 2C horizon appear multicolored in many pedons.  Some pedons have a sandy 3C horizon below a depth of 40 inches."

Enloe soils do not have an abrupt textural change from the albic to the argillic horizon and are wetter.  Fargo and Hegne soils are clayey throughout and do not have an albic or argillic horizon.  In addition, Hegne soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches."
