  "OVERVIEW": "The Garlips series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Garlips soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts in July and moist in some parts in June and for 60 cumulative days in the period August 1 through October 30.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 18 to 35 inches.  The calcic horizon contains 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate.  The soil is noncalcareous to a depth of 7 to 20 inches.  The particle- size control section contains 5 to 20 percent rock fragments that are less than 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline (pH 8.2 to 8.6). It is clay loam, loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly loam."
