    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 63 to 65 degrees F.  The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts in July and moist in some parts in June and for 60 cumulative days in the period August 1 through October 30.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 18 to 35 inches.  The calcic horizon contains 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate.  The soil is noncalcareous to a depth of 7 to 20 inches.  The particle- size control section contains 5 to 20 percent rock fragments that are less than 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline (pH 8.2 to 8.6). It is clay loam, loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly loam."

The Arnegard and Garza series lack calcic horizons.  The Shawa series is noncalcareous to 60 inches or more.  Falkirk soils have lithologic discontinuities above 40 inches.  Lone cone soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Roseglen soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section in July.  Sheckle soils have neutral to medium acid soil reaction throughout."

Elevation ranges from 6,600 to 8,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 60 to 95 days."
