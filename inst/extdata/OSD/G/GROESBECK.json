  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick and in some pedons extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon.  The lower boundary of the solum rests abruptly on limestone bedrock or grades into bedded limestone with soil occupying the interstices.  The clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent. Siliceous pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt and/or Btk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8. Mottles are in shades of red, brown or yellow. Grayish colors are considered to be lithochromic. Texture is fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Calcium carbonate concretions range from 0 to 15 percent. Black concretions range from none to few.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown or yellow. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from 15 to 50 percent.  Black concretions range from none to few.  Limestone fragments range from none to few in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe 2R layer is hard limestone bedrock that is tightly fractured.  Fossils range from none to common.  Hardness is more than 3 on Moh`s scale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Coyle and Klump series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Personville and Lavender series. Coyle soils do not have a lithic contact. Klump soils have redder hue and sola more than 40 inches thick. Lavender soils have a ochric epipedon, and Personville soils are deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Groesbeck soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slope gradients are mainly less than 2 percent but range to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loamy Pleistocene sediments deposited over the Tehuacana Limestone, mainly of the Midway Group of Tertiary Age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 38 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F. Frost free days range from 250 to 260 and elevation ranges from 430 to 650 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 56 to 64."

Lavender soils are on similar positions and have hue redder than 10YR in the Bt horizons.  Personville soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have a deep solum.  Wilson soils are dark gray throughout and are on slightly lower positions."
