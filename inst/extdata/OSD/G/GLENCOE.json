However, with changes in the latest Soil Taxonomy extending the series control section to 150 centimeters, another series (Shandep) with similar properties would best fit this concept.\nThe type location was moved from Steele County, Minnesota to Jackson County, Minnesota in 5/09 to clearly describe the series concept within the MLRA.\nBased on current investigations, elevation range in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meters above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296 has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.\nCation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
