  "OVERVIEW": "The Gothard series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in old lake and fan alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone. Gothard soils are on alkali flats and bordering playas with slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 10 to 16 inches. Precipitation occurs as thunderstorms from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains. The frost-free period is 155 to 220 days."
