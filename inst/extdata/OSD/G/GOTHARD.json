  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gothard soils are on level to nearly level alkali flats and bordering playas at elevations of 3,600 to 4,300 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone. The climate is warm semiarid continental. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 10 to 16 inches. Precipitation occurs as thunderstorms from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains. The frost-free period is 155 to 220 days."
