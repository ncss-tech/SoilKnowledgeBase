    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The control section contains less than 15 percent rock fragments and 5 to 25 percent volcanic ash, cinders, and pumice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist, 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 6 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Below 10 inches it is fine sand, loamy sand or sand and has weak blocky structure or is massive or single grain.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The upper part above 40 inches has 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  At depths below 40 inches the C horizon is sand or coarse sand modified by 35 to 75 percent rock fragments or is stratified with thin layers of sandy loam and silt loam in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

They formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from andesite and pumice.  They are in a mild maritime humid climate.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 80 inches, average January temperature is 38 degrees F, average July temperature is 61 degrees F, and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 130 to 170 days."

Buckley soils are poorly drained and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Ledow soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and layers finer than fine sand in the control section.  National soils are cindery over medial.  Siler soils are ashy over medial.  Schooley soils are ashy over loamy and have an aquic moisture regime.  Snoqualmie soils are sandy-skeletal."
