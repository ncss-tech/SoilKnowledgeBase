The depth to partially weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 80 percent rock fragments of which 40 to 60 percent are cobbles and 10 to 20 percent are gravel and it averages 25 to 35 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or extremely cobbly loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid."

Atring soils are dry in the moisture control section 45 to 60 consecutive days; in addition, the coarse fragments are primarily gravel size and the solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The Baldhill, Farber, Hartless, Kanid, Kindig and Terbies soils are over 40 inches deep.  The Beekman, Inskip, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Vena and Woodin soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Clallam soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Straight soils average 10 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and the coarse fragments are primarily gravel size."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from breccia and andesite.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
