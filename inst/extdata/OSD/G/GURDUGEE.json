  "OVERVIEW": "The Gurdugee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Gurdugee soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
