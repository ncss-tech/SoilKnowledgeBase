  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenbrook series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Glenbrook soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.  Hard unweathered bedrock is usually within 183 cm of the soil surface.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nOther features: Base saturation is over 75 percent in all parts.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 0 to 8 percent.\nRock fragments:  10 to 25 percent, mainly fine gravel (2-5 mm in diameter).  Lithology of fragments are granitic rock such as granodiorite.\nA horizons\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue:  4 through 6 dry; 2 through 4 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nC horizon\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue:  5 through 7 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly sand, or coarse sand."
