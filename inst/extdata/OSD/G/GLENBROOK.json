The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.  Hard unweathered bedrock is usually within 183 cm of the soil surface.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nOther features: Base saturation is over 75 percent in all parts.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 0 to 8 percent.\nRock fragments:  10 to 25 percent, mainly fine gravel (2-5 mm in diameter).  Lithology of fragments are granitic rock such as granodiorite.\nA horizons\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue:  4 through 6 dry; 2 through 4 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nC horizon\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue:  5 through 7 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly sand, or coarse sand."

Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 2,075 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
