  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldaho series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till.  The Goldaho soils are on moraines.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
