The moisture control section of 7 to 25 inches is moist from January 1 to May 1 and dry from June 1 to October 15 in most years. The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F from February 15 to October 15. The mean annual soil temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F. The base saturation is below 50 percent. High concentrations of selenium occur throughout the profile. Surface angular, paracobble content is 2 to 14 percent.\nThe ABt horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/4 or 4/3. Clay content is 55 to 65 percent. Parachanner content is 7 to 14 percent. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid. Typically the surface has lost 25 to 75 percent of the surface thickness due to erosion.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 6/2 or 7/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/3 or 4/4. Clay content is 60 to 65 percent. Parachanner content is 15 to 35 percent. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BCt horizon has color of 10YR 6/4, 6/6 or 7/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/6 or 7/6. Texture is parachannery clay or very parachannery clay. Clay content is 60 to 65 percent. Parachanner content is 15 to 60 percent."

Grazer soils, on hills and mountains, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, have a fine particle-size control section, and have reaction of slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Rockland in the unpublished report, Soil Survey of Western Fresno, 1967.  They are being differentiated by being classified and mapped. According to Wiley D. Nettleton, NSSL Project Coordinator in 1987, in the typical pedon, apparently the eluvial horizon has been removed by erosion. His choice of horizons was ABt, Bt, BCt and Cr. Maximum error in selenium values was estimated to be 15 percent.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL lab data pedon sample number S84CA-019-017 (1853-1855) for the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
