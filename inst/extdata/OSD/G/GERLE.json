  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till, glacial outwash and alluvium derived primarily from granitic rocks.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep ground moraine and outwash plains and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches and mean annual temperature is 45 degrees.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to unweathered stratified sands and gravel is greater than 60 inches.  The thickness of the solum typically is 20 to 35 inches but ranges from 14 to 50 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist between depths of 8 and 24 inches and are dry in all parts from late July until early October.  Coarse fragments occupy 2 to 30 percent of the soil by volume, generally increasing with depth. The umbric epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation in the epipedon ranges from 5 to 40 percent and commonly is about 20 percent.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2 or 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or very bouldery sandy loam.  It has 2 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent boulders.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 7.5YR 3/4.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It has 2 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon dry color is 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/8.  The lower part of this horizon commonly is cobbly or gravelly coarse sandy loam and less commonly sandy loam or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  It has 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  This horizon is neutral to moderately acid."
