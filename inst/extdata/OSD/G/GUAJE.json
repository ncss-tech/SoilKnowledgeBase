  "OVERVIEW": "The Guaje series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed from basalt, pumice and volcanic ash with additions of eolian material and calcium carbonate.  Guaje soils are on footslopes, hills and volcanic cones.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils formed mainly in basalt pumice and ash with additions of eolian material and calcium carbonate.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The precipitation has a summer maximum distribution pattern."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nThe classification of this soils is changed from medial skeletal, mesic shallow Ustollic Calciorthids to medial-skeletal, mesic Aridic Ustochrepts.  The aridic soil moisture regime placement was done when the aridic and ustic soil moisture regime concepts were vague. The Bk horizon is weakly cemented but is not a paralithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A horizons)\nCalcic horizons:  The zone from 9 to 60 inches.
