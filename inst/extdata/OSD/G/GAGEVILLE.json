Lima soils have sola less than 75 centimeters thick.\nBeech, Dormont, Funkstown, Glenhall, Octagon, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, and Summitville soils are similar soils in a related family. The Beech soils do not have carbonates within 200 centimeters. Dormont soils formed in residuum or colluvium from interbedded sedimentary rocks. Funkstown soils have rock fragments composed of chert, quartzitic sandstone and limestone that range from 10 to 60 percent in individual subhorizons of the Bt horizon. The Glenhall and Rainsville soils have redoximorphic depletions beginning below 30 inches. The Octagon soils have a reaction ranging from moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon and moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part of the Bt horizon. The Rawson soils formed in outwash or other water-sorted material 50 to 100 centimeters thick underlain by till or lacustrine sediments that contain more than 35 percent clay. The Richland soils formed in colluvial materials with rock fragments ranging from 20 to 35 percent in the lower part of the Bt horizon, and from 20 to 55 percent in the C horizon. The Summitville soils have a paralithic contact with interbedded siltstone or sandstone and soft, red clay shale within 100 to 200 centimeters."
