    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Cadmus and Colescreek series are in the same family. Cadmus soils have carbonates within a depth of 24 to 36 inches. Colescreek soils are formed in alluvium and have a mean annual temperature range greater than 52 degrees and a slope less than 18 percent.\nDormont, Funkstown, Glenhall, Octagon, Rainsville, and Rawson soils are similar soils in another family. The Beech, Richland, and Summitville series may be in the same family when classified to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The Beech soils do not have carbonates within 80 inches. Dormont soils have a lithic contact within 48 to 80 inches. Funkstown soils have rock fragments composed of chert, quartzitic sandstone and limestone that range from 10 to 60 percent in individual subhorizons of the Bt horizon. The Glenhall and Rainsville soils have redoximorphic depletions beginning below 30 inches. The Octagon soils have a reaction ranging from moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon and moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part of the Bt horizon. The Rawson soils formed in outwash or other water-sorted material 20 to 40 inches thick underlain by till or lacustrine sediments that contain more than 35 percent clay. The Richland soils formed in colluvial materials with rock fragments ranging from 20 to 35 percent in the lower part of the Bt horizon, and from 20 to 55 percent in the C horizon. The Summitville soils have a paralithic contact with interbedded siltstone or sandstone and soft, red clay shale within 40 to 80 inches."
