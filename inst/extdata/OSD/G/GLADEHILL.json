  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the Ap, A, and Bw horizons, and from 0 to 35 percent in the C and BC horizons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. In some pedons, the upper Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The fine earth texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have individual subhorizons of sandy clay loam or clay loam below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gladehill soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestones, siltstones, and shales of Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian ages. In Virginia, Gladehill soils are on floodplains of the North Forks of the Holston and Shenandoah Rivers, the James River and its tributaries, and Reed Creek. Gladehill soils also occur on flood plains of the portions of the Maury River and other stream that drain areas underlain by rocks of the above lithologies and ages. Climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Gullion, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap contain more clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Derroc and Ogles soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Irongate soils have a seasonal high water table between depths of 18 and 36 inches and are on similar landscapes. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces."
