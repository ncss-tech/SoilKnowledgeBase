    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.  The depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 10 to 15 inches. Depth to the paralithic  contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent and are mostly gravel. The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.   This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cy horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR. It contains 40 to 60 percent gypsum.  There is no decrease in gypsum content with increasing depth. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gystrum soils are on nearly level to very steep hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in gypsiferous, reddish brown sediments weathered from gypsum bedrock and interbedded redbed shales and siltstones. Elevation is 2950 to 6,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees to 53 degrees F., summer temperature is 60 to 74 degrees F. Frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Rekop soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  La Fonda soils lack high gypsum content in the C horizon."
