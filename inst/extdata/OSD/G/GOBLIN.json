The soils formed in calcareous and gypsiferous alluvium and residuum of weathered shale and sandstone with some eolian influence.  Some areas have a surface mantle of basalt cobbles. The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 10 inches.  The average freeze-free period is 120 to 160 days."
