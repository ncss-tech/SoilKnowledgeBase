It ranges from slightly acid\nto very strongly acid.\nThe B21t and B22t horizons are reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), brown\n(7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4), or red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8).  The\nB22t horizon has none to common mottles of red, yellowish red, reddish yellow, brownish yellow, or pale brown.  The B21t and B22t horizons are clay or clay loam and range from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe B23t and B3 horizons are reddish brown to strong brown,\nranging to mottled red, brown, or yellow.  They range from sandy\nclay loam to clay and from medium acid to very  strongly acid.\nThe Cr layer ranges from weakly cemented to strongly cemented sandstone, clay shale, or shaly clay with platy rock structure."

Albertville, Carnasaw, Enders, Gritney, Kirvin, McQueen, Remlap, Tatum, Vance,\nand Williamsville soils lack bedrock within 40 inches of the\nsurface.  Arriola and Rosenwall soils have gray mottles that are indicative of wetness and in addition, Arriola soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Arundel soils have B2t\nhorizons of 10YR hues.  Cuthbert soils contain mica flakes and ironstone fragments.  Luverne and Sweatman soils contain mica\nflakes.  Townley soils have 5 to 20 percent shale fragments in the B2t horizon."

The soil\nformed in clayey shales, shaly clay, and sandstones of the\nManning, Wellborn, and Yegua Formations.  The climate is subhumid.  The mean annual temperature at the type location is about 68\ndegrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is about 70."
