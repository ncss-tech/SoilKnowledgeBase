  "OVERVIEW": "The Greys series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium from loess. Greys soils are on hills, fan remnants, terraces, moraines, mountain slopes, and footslopes of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.",
