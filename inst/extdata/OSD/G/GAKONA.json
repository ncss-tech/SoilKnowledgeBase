  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 1 to 8 inches.  There is more than 35 percent clay by weighted average in the particle size control section.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the loess mantle, to moderately alkaline in the clayey substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or silt.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AC horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist of 2, 3, or 4.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or silt.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay or clay; Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent; Effervescence ranges from slightly to strongly with disseminated lime present in the lower horizons.  The reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall ranges from 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copper River, Klawasi, Mendeltna, and Wrangell soils.  Copper River soils have silty textures and are on similar landforms.  Klawasi soils are the frozen counterpart of Gakona and contain permafrost within the control section.  Mendeltna soils have loam and clay loam textures and are on lacustrine terraces higher than Klawasi soils.  Wrangell soils are organic soils indepressional a eas and muskegs."
