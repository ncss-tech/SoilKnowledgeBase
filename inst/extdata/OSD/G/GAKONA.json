  "OVERVIEW": "The Gakona series consists of well drained soils formed in a thin silty loess mantle overlying clayey lacustrine deposits.  Gakona soils are on broad lacustrine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

There is more than 35 percent clay by weighted average in the particle size control section.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the loess mantle, to moderately alkaline in the clayey substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or silt.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AC horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist of 2, 3, or 4.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or silt.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay or clay; Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent; Effervescence ranges from slightly to strongly with disseminated lime present in the lower horizons.  The reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Klawasi soils are the frozen counterpart of Gakona and contain permafrost within the control section.  Mendeltna soils have loam and clay loam textures and are on lacustrine terraces higher than Klawasi soils.  Wrangell soils are organic soils indepressional a eas and muskegs."
