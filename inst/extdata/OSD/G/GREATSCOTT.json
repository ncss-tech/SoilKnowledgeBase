The content of rock fragments averages 1 to 15 percent, by volume, throughout the profile. They consist of gravel, cobbles, stones, and boulders.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral. Value is 2 or 3, and chroma is 1 or 2. Texture is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ex horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. It is firm or very firm. Bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 1.95 gm/cc.\nThe B/E horizon has properties similar to the E and Bt respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Greatscott soils are on convex or linear surfaces of drumlins and moraines. Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent. They formed in loamy, dense glacial till that was deposited by the Rainy Lobe. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1200 to 1610 feet."
