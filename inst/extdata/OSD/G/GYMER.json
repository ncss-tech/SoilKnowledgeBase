  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was originally mapped as one soil on two different landscapes\n(uplands and terraces) and derived from two different parent materials. The red color of\nthe soil was the only characteristic of these soils in common. During the MLRA update\nGymer is to be relegated to the terrace position along rivers and streams, while the Polo\nseries will replace the Gymer mapped on the upland. Pedon used is 94KS045001. Lab\ndata were run at the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lab samples\nwere 94P6334S-94P6341S. The Gymer soil was reclassified from the fine to the fine-silty\nfamily.\n09/2008 GJJ Changed from fine to fine-silty, removed smectitic and added mixed,\nsuperactive, added some metric conversions, removed English units, and some format\nchanges.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 36 to 86 centimeters . (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 36 centimeters. (A, horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 36 to 114 centimeters . (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nCharacterization data pedons: 94KS045002 and 94KS103001. The assignment of the\ncation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers 94P6336S -\n94KS6338S.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
