Climax native vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate.  This site is dominated by little and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species.  The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn.  Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present.  This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (077CY035TX) range site in MLRA-77."
