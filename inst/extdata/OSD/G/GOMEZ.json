  "OVERVIEW": "The Gomez series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy and loamy calcareous eolian or fluvial sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn.  Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present.  This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (077CY035TX) range site in MLRA-77."
