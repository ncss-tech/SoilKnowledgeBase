    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam modified with 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Clay ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline throughout.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  A surface covering of gravel lag is common in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Carbonates range from 5 to 20 percent with less than one-fourth as pedogenetic accumulation."

Grieves and Sham soils have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y throughout.  Sham soils also have loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam profiles.  Tebbs soils have 10YR hue in all C horizons and are more moist in July, August, and September."

Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 6,300 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
