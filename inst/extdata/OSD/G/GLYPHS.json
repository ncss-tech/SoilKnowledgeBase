  "OVERVIEW": "The Glyphs series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Glyphs soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
