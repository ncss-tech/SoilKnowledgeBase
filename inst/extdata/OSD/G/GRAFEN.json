  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent but is usually more than 90 percent.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually sandy loam, but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Textures coarser than loamy very fine sand are excluded from the above range.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly more than 10 inches in diameter.  In some pedons subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur, but a major part of the control section above the bedrock has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

The soil formed in moderately thin noncalcareous, moderately coarse textured parent materials weathered from soft sandstone and loamstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F.  and mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F."
