  "OVERVIEW": "The Grantcenter series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on old stream meanders and natural levees on flood plains. These soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 675 millimeters.",
