  "OVERVIEW": "The Greystoke series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from andesite or basalt.  The soils are on plateaus and hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 75 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is less than 75 percent in some parts of the upper 30 inches of the solum.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to weathered andesite is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent gravel, and 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay, 10 to 30 percent gravel, and 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones. It is a very cobbly loam, very gravelly loam, or cobbly clay loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent gravel, and 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones.  It is a very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam.
