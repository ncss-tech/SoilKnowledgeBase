  "OVERVIEW": "The Greystoke series consists of deep, well drained soils that\nformed in residuum and colluvium weathered from andesite or\nbasalt.  The soils are on plateaus and hillslopes and have slopes\nof 1 to 75 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 44\ndegrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

The mean\nannual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is less than 75 percent in some parts\nof the upper 30 inches of the solum.  The mollic epipedon is 20\nto 30 inches thick.  Depth to weathered andesite is 40 to 60\ninches.
