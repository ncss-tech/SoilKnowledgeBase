The mean\nannual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is less than 75 percent in some parts\nof the upper 30 inches of the solum.  The mollic epipedon is 20\nto 30 inches thick.  Depth to weathered andesite is 40 to 60\ninches.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35\npercent clay, 25 to 50 percent gravel, and 10 to 30 percent\ncobbles and stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3\nmoist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 10 to\n20 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones.

Getaway soils lack hue of 7.5YR or redder in the A\nhorizon, have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, the fine earth fraction of the A horizon is silt loam and is loess and a\nlithologic discontinuity is identified at the A/2Bt horizons.\nThe Smarts and Toncana soils have rock fragments composed of conglomerate, limestone, sandstone and quartzite.
