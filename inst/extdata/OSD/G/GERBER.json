  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerber series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, till, or glaciolacustrine material.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0098.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); an argillic horizon from 7 to 14 inches, that is also the particle-size control section (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation from 14 to 46 inches (Bk1, Bk2, 2Bk horizons); a discontinuity of till at 32 inches (2Bk horizon).  Gerber soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.  The Gerber soils were classified as Udorthentic Chromusterts.  They do not have the intersecting slickensides needed for the Vertisol order.  They do have pressure faces on ped surfaces and deep cracks to 20 inches."
