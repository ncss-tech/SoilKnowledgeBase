  "OVERVIEW": "The Garlet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on foot slopes, mountains, and till plains.   Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0176, MT0689, MT0806, MT1195, MT1280.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an albic horizon from the mineral soil surface to 21 inches (E1, E2 horizons); a mixed horizon of cambic and albic materials 21 to 48 inches (Bw/E horizon); a horizon of carbonate accumulation from 48 to 70 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (E2, Bw/E horizons).  Garlet soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
