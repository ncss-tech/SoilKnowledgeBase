  "OVERVIEW": "The Goose Lake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with surficial mantles of eolian volcanic ash.  Goose Lake soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
