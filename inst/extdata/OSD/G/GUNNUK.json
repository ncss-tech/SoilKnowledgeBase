  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gunnuk series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty glacio-marine or glacio-lacustrine sediments.  Gunnuk soils occur on uplifted marine terraces or on glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 F., and mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has a weighted average of 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Texture is typically silt loam or silty clay loam but the range includes some subhorizons of very fine sandy loam, silty clay or clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in some pedons.  The lower solum and C horizons are mottled.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper solum and is slightly acid or neutral in the BC and C horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma from 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma from 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma from 1 to 3.  Texture is typically silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay but often contains thin strata of very fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam."
