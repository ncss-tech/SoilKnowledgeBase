  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has a weighted average of 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Texture is typically silt loam or silty clay loam but the range includes some subhorizons of very fine sandy loam, silty clay or clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in some pedons.  The lower solum and C horizons are mottled.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper solum and is slightly acid or neutral in the BC and C horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma from 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma from 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma from 1 to 3.  Texture is typically silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay but often contains thin strata of very fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kupreanof, Maybeso and Wadleigh soils.  Kupreanof soils are on colluvial footslopes and mountain sideslopes and have coarser textures.  Maybeso soils are on concave slopes and are very poorly drained.  Wadleigh soils are poorly drained soils on glacial moraines."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  A perched water table is at depths of 10 to 40 inches for brief periods during the growing season.  Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and very slow in the C horizon.  Runoff is slow to medium under native vegetation, however if the surface organic horizon is disturbed the runoff is rapid."

The type location has also been changed from the 1969 site because of insufficient documentation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data are available at the National Soil Survey Lab.
