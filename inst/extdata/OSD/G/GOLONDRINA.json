Majada, Purcella, and Willowman soils have calcic horizons within 40 inches.  Montoso soils have strongly contrasting layers of cinders between 12 and 32 inches (The concept of Montoso should be reexamined and possibly reclassified as Loamy over pumiceous or cindery).  Murdo soils have sola 10 to 20 inches thick over horizons of strongly contrasting sands and gravel (The concept of Murdo should be reexamined and possibly reclassified as Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal).  Nederland soils do not have horizons of secondary calcium carbonate and are more moist in spring and early summer months.  Romine soils average less than 40 percent total sand in the particle-size control section and are in an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.  Wandurn soils are deep to a lithic contact."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Golondrina soils are on backslopes and footslopes of erosional fan remnants.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, schist, and from Tertiary loess. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
