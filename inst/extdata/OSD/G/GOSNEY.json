    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is usually dry and is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days (cumulative). The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The pumice content (0.5 to 2.0 mm.) of the soil ranges from 20 to 60 percent.  The soil has a field estimated clay content of 0 to 5 percent.  It has throughout a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and glass plus glass coated aggregate of 30 to 60 percent, and 15-bar water content of 5 to 7 percent on dried samples.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 2 moist with chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist. It has 5 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent stones. Total rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 45 percent.  It has 0.5 to 1.0 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist. It is loamy sand and gravelly loamy sand. It has 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Total rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 30 percent. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2R is massive flow basalt which cannot be broken without blasting."
