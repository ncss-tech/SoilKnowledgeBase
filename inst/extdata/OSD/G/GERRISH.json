  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerrish series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial material on outwash plains, kame moraines and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (42 degrees F).",
