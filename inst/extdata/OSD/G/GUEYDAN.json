  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum to buried soil material ranges from 24 to 80 inches or more. The n-values are less than 0.7 in all mineral horizons to a depth of 40 inches or more. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid in the Op or Oa horizon, from extremely acid to medium acid in the Bg, Byg and BCg horizons, and from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the 2A and 2B horizons.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Where value is 2 or 3, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is mucky clay, clay, or silty clay.\nThe Bg, Byg, and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or have neutral chroma with values of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  At least some subhorizon of the B horizon has a polygonal network of cracks 2 to 20 millimeters wide that do not close when the soil is wet.\nThe 2A and 2B horizons have the same color range as the Bg, Byg, and BCg horizons. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gueydan soils are in drained fresh water marshes at elevations at or below sea level.  These soils formed in a thick layer of recent clayey alluvium over subsided Prairie-age terrace deposits.  These soils are protected from flooding by a system of levees and pumps.   Slope is less than 1 percent.  Near the type location the annual rainfall is about 53 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Larose series and the Allemands and Ged series.  Allemands soils are organic and Ged soils have argillic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Gueydan soils are poorly drained. Runoff is slow to very slow.  Permeability is very slow. Water and air, however, move freely through a lateral network of cracks in the lower part of the B horizon. The water table is generally maintained at 1 to 3 feet below the soil surface. It is controlled by a system of levees, ditches, and pumps."
