  "OVERVIEW": "The Groff series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on flood plains or in drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",
