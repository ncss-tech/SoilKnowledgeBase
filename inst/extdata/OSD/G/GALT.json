  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  The soils have cracks 1 to 4 cm wide at a depth of 20 inches.  The cracks are open from about mid-June to mid-October and remain closed the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 64 degrees to 66 degrees F. Some pedons have Bk horizons with similar colors as Bss horizons.\nThe A horizon has colors of dominantly 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 2/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, or 4/3.  Distinct redoximorphic concentrations with chromas of 4 or 6 are present in the upper 2 to 7 inches.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 30 to 60 percent clay.  In some areas the surface is a pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam overburden, (10YR 4/3) moist. It ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have Ak horizons with similar colors as C horizons.\nThe Bss and Bw horizons have mixed colors of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3. It is silty clay or clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous with accumulations of lime.  Some pedons have a loam C horizon below the duripan.\nThe Bkqm or BKq horizon has dry colors of 10YR 8/1, 8/2, 7/3, 7/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 4/2.  It is massive or platy and weakly to strongly cemented with indurated laminar bands.  Some pedons have segregations of accumulated lime."

Alo, Asbill and Centerville soils have a paralithic contact between 20 to 40 inches. Altamont, Auld and Ayar, Capay and Porterville soils lack a duripan within 40 inches.  Asolt soils have a lithic contact below 40 inches. Cibo soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches.  Seville soils have 7.5YR and 5YR hues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Galt soils are in basins of low terraces and on basin rims of the Victor Formation and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Commonly they are in small slightly concave or level basins that may be connected by narrow drainage ways.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly granitic rock sources.  Elevations are 10 to 150 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Average January air temperature is about 44 degrees F; average July temperature is about 75 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F. Average frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days."
