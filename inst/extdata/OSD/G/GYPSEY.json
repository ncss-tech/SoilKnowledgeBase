  "OVERVIEW": "The Gypsey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from Mancos Shale. Gypsey soils are on dissected pediments, plains and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
