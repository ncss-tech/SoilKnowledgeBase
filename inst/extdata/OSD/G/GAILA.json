  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches and commonly ranges to more than 50 feet. Rock fragment content of vein quartz ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile and partially weathered muscovite schist fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the B and C horizons.  Unlimed reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  Yellower and redder mottling and streaks are common. Texture is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon commonly is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown, and white.  Some pedons have uniform color in one of these shades.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loam, with the sand fraction being dominantly muscovite mica."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family. Brinklow and Occoquan are in a closely related family with semiactive activity class.  Brinklow soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches and have fragments of veined quartz and phyllite.  Occoquan soils do not have the weathered muscovite schist fragments but have soft granite gneiss between 40 and 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gaila Soils are on nearly level to very steep uplands of the Northern part of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes commonly range from 0 to 55 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent on summit and shoulder positions on ridges.  These soils formed in materials that weathered from quartz muscovite and mica schist.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 48 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

The poorly drained Baile, the moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained Glenville and the well to moderately well drained Meadowville soils are in concave positions in the landscape and are subject to seasonal water tables. The Glenelg soils have sola thickness that ranges from 20 to 40 inches, the Chester soils have depths to the base of the argillic rangeing from 31 to 55 inches thick and the Elioak soils have more than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously mapped Manor soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:\na: Ochric epipedon-from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap).\nb: Argillic horizon-between 7 and 15 inches (Bt).\nc. Base saturation is 35 percent or less.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The Gaila Soils are extremely low in calcium and magnesium content.  The series has been held to soils that developed in residuum from quartz muscovite schist.  The substratum consists of soft saprolite with a high content of muscovite mica.  Silt content is low but the mica content causes the soil to feel slick or silty.  Mica content by grain count is commonly more than 40 percent in the C horizon.\nRevisions made 2/2008 to update competing and geographically associated soils as well as geographic setting and terminology.\nPrevious revision:  JHE-DDR-EPE 07/2001\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
