  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldston series consists of shallow, well drained to excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained metasedimentary or metavolcanic rocks in the Carolina Slate Belt. This soil averages more than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F. near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. This soil has a weighted average of more than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume. Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches or more. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in all horizons except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Rock fragments, from 1/4 inch to 6 inches or more in size, comprise 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Rock fragments, from 1/4 inch to 6 inches or more in size, comprise 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red are in some pedons. Rock fragments ranging from 1/2 inch to 6 inches or more in size comprise 35 to 70 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered fractured fine-grained metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock.\nThe R horizon is unweathered fractured fine-grained metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock."

Misenheimer soils are moderately well drained. Montevallo soils are shaly, have mixed mineralogy, and lack R horizons. Nashoba soils lack bedrock at depths less than 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are dominantly from 4 to 25 percent but range from 2 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic slates. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and mean annual temperature about 60 degrees F., near the type location."

Alamance and Kirksey have a fine-loamy or fine-silty particle size class and have a depth to bedrock of greater than 20 inches. Badin, Georgeville, Herndon, Lignum, Nanford, Orange, and Tarrus soils have a fine particle size class and have a depth to bedrock of greater than 20 inches.

About 1/3 to 1/2 of the areas have been cleared in the past but most have been allowed to revert to forest. Cleared areas are used mainly for growing grain sorghum, small grain, corn, pasture, and hay."
