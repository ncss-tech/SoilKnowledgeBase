  "OVERVIEW": "The Goosel series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks influenced by loess and volcanic ash.  The Goosel soils are on summits and side slopes of volcanic flowrock plateaus and rock pediments.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
