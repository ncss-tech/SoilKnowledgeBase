  "OVERVIEW": "The Gregson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, outwash fans, stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, depressions and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
