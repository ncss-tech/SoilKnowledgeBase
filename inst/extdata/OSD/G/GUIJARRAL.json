Agust soils (MLRA 42), on piedmont slopes, alluvial fans and high terraces, have color hue of 7.5YR, no cambic horizon and receive most precipitation during August and September. Algerita soils (MLRA 42), on basin floors and alluvial fan-piedmonts at elevations of 4,200 to 5,000 feet, have color hue of 7.5YR and receive intermittent precipitation from July through September. Cronese soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial fans at elevations of 1,800 to 3,600 feet, with mean annual precipitation of 3 to 7 inches, do not have a cambic horizon. Grapevine soils (MLRA 30), on basin floor remnants and relict alluvial flats at elevations of 1,500 to 4,500 feet, have periodic precipitation from July through September and do not have a cambic horizon. Nikey soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial fans and desert foothill slopes at elevations of 2,650 to 3,500 feet, have frost-free season of 180 to 200 days and have color hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.

The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sedimentary rock. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 84 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F.
