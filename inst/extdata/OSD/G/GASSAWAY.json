The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F from early March until late December and is above 47 degrees F from about early April until early December.  The soil moisture control section (6 inches to a lithic contact) is moist throughout from early December until mid April for about 120 days and is dry throughout from about mid June until early November for about 135 days.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and gravel, on the surface range from 15 to 35 percent.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate method ranges from 62 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, or 5/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR or 4/4.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and gravel, range from 15 to 35 percent by volume.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bw horizon color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, or 5/4.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4; or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is loam or gravelly loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 18 percent and has less than 3 percent (absolute) clay increase.
