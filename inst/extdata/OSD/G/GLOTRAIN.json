  "OVERVIEW": "The Glotrain series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash and minor amounts of limestone. Glotrain soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
