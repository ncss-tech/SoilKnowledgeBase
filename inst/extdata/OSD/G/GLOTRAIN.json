    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glotrain soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash, and minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,300 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost free period is 110 to 150 days."
