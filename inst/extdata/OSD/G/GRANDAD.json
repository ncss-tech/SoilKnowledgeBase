  "OVERVIEW": "The Grandad series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in material derived from mica schist and gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridgetops. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 1,150 mm and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
