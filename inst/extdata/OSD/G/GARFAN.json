  "OVERVIEW": "The Garfan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite on fan remnants, partial ballenas and to a limited extent from colluvium on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
