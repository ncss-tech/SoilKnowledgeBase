    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Garfan soils are dominantly on fan remnants and partial ballenas, although they are also found in localized areas on mountain side slopes. These soils are formed in alluvium (and colluvium on hills) derived from quartzite. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,000 to 2,620 meters. The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
