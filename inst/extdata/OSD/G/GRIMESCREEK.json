    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grimescreek soils are on flood plains at elevations of 3,400 to 4,650 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from igneous rocks (dominantly granodiorite) and fine pyroclastic materials. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 28 inches. The average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Brassey soils are well drained, loamy-skeletal and occur on alluvial fan remnants. Middlefork soils are well drained, have fine-loamy argillic horizons and occur on alluvial fan remnants. Pioneervil soils are moderately well drained, do not have pachic epipedons and occur on adjacent higher flood-plain steps."
