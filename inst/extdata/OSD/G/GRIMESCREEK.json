  "OVERVIEW": "The Grimescreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous materials. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent in mountains valleys, intermontane basins and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
