Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.8 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 207 to 305 meters (680 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the poorly drained Drummer soils, the somewhat poorly drained La Hogue soils, and the moderately well drained Barce and Billett soils. Drummer soils have grayer subsoils and are in depressions and swales. La Hogue soils have redox depletions at shallower depths and are on slightly lower lying rises. Barce soils have the lower part of the solum formed in till and are on similar landscape positions. Billett soils contain more sand in the solum and are on slightly higher lying landscape positions."
