  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates typically is 20 to 40 inches and ranges from about 14 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to about 40 inches in thickness and includes part or all of the Bw horizon.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam and has more than 5 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It has chroma of 2 in the lower part of some pedons.  It is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate grades of prismatic and blocky structure.  Faint redox features are in the lower part of the Bw horizon in some pedons. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It does not have redox features in some pedons. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The C horizon below depths of 40 inches commonly has texture similar to the control section, but in some pedons it contains coarser or finer textured glacial till or lacustrine sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gardena soils are on level to sloping terraces, deltas and glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients commonly average between 1 to 3 percent and range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous silty and loamy glaciolacustrine sediments.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches. Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bearden, Borup, Colvin, Eckman, Embden, Glyndon, Overly and Perella soils.  Bearden, Colvin and Perella soils are on nearby lake plains.  They are fine-silty.  In addition, Colvin and Perella soils are poorly drained; and Bearden and Colvin soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches. Borup, Eckman and Glyndon soils are in a drainage sequence with Gardena soils. Borup soils are in the swales, basins and low flats; Eckman soils are on the slopes and convex parts of the landscape; and Glyndon soils are on the level parts and lower elevations.  Borup soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches and are poorly drained. Eckman soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Glyndon soils do not have Bw horizons and have calcic horizons at depths of less than 16 inches. Embden and Overly soils are on nearby deltas and lake plains.  Embden soils are coarse-loamy.  Overly soils are fine-silty."
