Daulton and Whiterock overlie olive colored, highly fractured, and vertically tilted slate bedrock associated with the Mariposa formation. Whiterock soils are also strongly or very strongly acid, and Daulton soils have bedrock at depths greater than 25 cm. Exchequer soils have a moist chroma of 4 to 8 throughout and overlie schists and metavolcanic rocks. Ocraig soils have coarse sandy loam textures having very coarse sand plus coarse sand greater than 20 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Goldwall soils are on open depressions between mounds on lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from latite. Elevation is 165 to 655 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 505 to 910 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 225 to 305 days."

Toomes soils occupy mounds on lava plateaus, have cambic horizons, and are between 25 to 50 cm to bedrock. Shawsflat and Angelscreek are loamy-skeletal and form in colluvium on the sideslopes adjacent to lava plateaus and lahars. Miltonhills soils form from acidic tuff on the side slopes of hills and erosion remnants, are moderately deep, and have an umbric epipedon. Pentz and Inks soils form on hills, have a mollic epipedon, and have a paralithic contact within 50 cm."
