  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldwall series consists of very shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from latite. The Goldwall soils are on open depressions between mounds, on the summits of lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 8% percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",

Daulton and Whiterock overlie olive colored, highly fractured, and vertically tilted slate bedrock associated with the Mariposa formation. Whiterock soils are also strongly or very strongly acid, and Daulton soils have bedrock at depths greater than 25 cm. Exchequer soils have a moist chroma of 4 to 8 throughout and overlie schists and metavolcanic rocks. Ocraig soils have coarse sandy loam textures having very coarse sand plus coarse sand greater than 20 percent."

Toomes soils occupy mounds on lava plateaus, have cambic horizons, and are between 25 to 50 cm to bedrock. Shawsflat and Angelscreek are loamy-skeletal and form in colluvium on the sideslopes adjacent to lava plateaus and lahars. Miltonhills soils form from acidic tuff on the side slopes of hills and erosion remnants, are moderately deep, and have an umbric epipedon. Pentz and Inks soils form on hills, have a mollic epipedon, and have a paralithic contact within 50 cm."
