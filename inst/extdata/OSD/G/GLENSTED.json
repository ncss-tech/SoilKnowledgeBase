Adco soils have a Bt horizon with a chroma of 3 or 4. Appanoose, Chariton, and Putnam soils have more than 48 percent clay in the particle size control section and do not have the 2B horizon. Awbrig soils have a base of the argillic horizon at 30 to 50 inches. Belinda soils do not have the 2B horizon with chert fragments. Brooklyn soils have a 2B horizon formed in loamy stratified outwash, alluvium or loam till. Cisne soils average less than 42 percent clay in the particle size control section and the 2B horizon is formed in reworked loess and till. Cowden and Denny soils have less clay in the particle size control section and do not have horizons with chert fragments. Wagner soils do not have horizons with chert fragments and formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits."

The soils formed in loess and in the underlying residuum from cherty limestone and shale. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."
