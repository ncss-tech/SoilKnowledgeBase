  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glensted series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loess and in the underlying residuum from cherty limestone and shale. These soils are on ridgetops and the headslopes of drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Awbrig soils have a base of the argillic horizon at 30 to 50 inches. Belinda soils do not have the 2B horizon with chert fragments. Brooklyn soils have a 2B horizon formed in loamy stratified outwash, alluvium or loam till. Cisne soils average less than 42 percent clay in the particle size control section and the 2B horizon is formed in reworked loess and till. Cowden and Denny soils have less clay in the particle size control section and do not have horizons with chert fragments.
