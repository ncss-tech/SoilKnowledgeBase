  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches from the mineral soil surface. Reaction of the soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 5 to less than 35 percent in the solum.\nThe O horizon ranges from slightly to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture ranges from silt loam to fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture ranges from silt loam to loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR with value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR with value of 4 or more and a chroma of 3 or more. The B horizon ranges from silt loam to coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is strongly or moderately smeary.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture ranges from silt loam to loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Loamy sand or loamy coarse sand horizons are up to 5 inches thick. Finer textured BC and C horizons are up to 14 inches thick. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 10 to 60 percent.\nBedrock is slightly weathered schist, phyllite, or gneiss."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.\nThe Saddleback and Stratton series are in related families. Saddleback and Stratton soils are shallow to bedrock and Stratton soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glebe soils are on mountain side slopes, mountain tops, mountain ridges, and hill tops. Slope ranges from 3 to 80 percent. The soils formed in loamy till of Wisconsin age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 80 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 30 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 30 to 90 days. Elevation is typically greater than 2,000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Londonderry, Ricker, and Stratton soils, which are in similar positions on the landscape as the Glebe soils, and the Hogback, Houghtonville, and Rawsonville soils which are in similar positions but at slightly lower elevations. Londonderry soils are very shallow. Ricker soils are very shallow or shallow organic soils. Stratton soils are shallow. The shallow Hogback soils, moderately deep Rawsonville soils very deep Houghtonville soils have a frigid temperature regime."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. These soils are saturated for short duration during period of rainfall or snowmelt, but water moves laterally across the bedrock and does not become stagnant. Permeability is moderately rapid."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of the areas are forested. The common coniferous species are eastern hemlock, balsam fir, and red spruce. Northern hardwoods are mountain ash, American beech, paper birch, yellow birch, mountain maple, sugar maple, and red maple. Ground cover in small open areas is moss, ferns, or blueberries."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Oi, A and E horizons).\nb. Spodic Horizon - the zone from 6 to 36 inches (Bh, Bhs and Bs horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: This series is based on field profile descriptions and laboratory data from New York and\nVermont. NSSL lab data is available for S80VT-23-4.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
