  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 38 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches from the mineral soil surface. Reaction of the soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 5 to less than 35 percent in the solum.\nThe O horizon ranges from slightly to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture ranges from silt loam to fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture ranges from silt loam to loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR with value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR with value of 4 or more and a chroma of 3 or more. The B horizon ranges from silt loam to coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is strongly or moderately smeary.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture ranges from silt loam to loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Loamy sand or loamy coarse sand horizons are up to 5 inches thick. Finer textured BC and C horizons are up to 14 inches thick. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 10 to 60 percent.\nBedrock is slightly weathered schist, phyllite, or gneiss."
