  "OVERVIEW": "The Graner series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in clayey material derived from acid shale.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Colors throughout the soil are largely inherited from the shale.  Texture of the control section is clay containing from 55 to 60 percent clay.  Consistence is soft or slightly hard when dry and friable when moist.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid throughout.  The soil has an Ustic moisture regime that borders on Aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon contains less than 1 percent more organic matter than the C.  It contains common to many partially weathered very fine shale fragments.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 2.  They contain over 50 percent by volume of partially weathered very fine shale fragments.  Bedded fissile shale is below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

They have very firm consistence and when dry have cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide and several feet long extending downward through the solum. Demar soils have argillic horizons and are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces and fans.  Grummit soils are on moderately sloping to steeply sloping uplands. They have bedded shale within depths of 20 inches."
