  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section.  In some pedons, the upper 10 inches is noncalcareous and slightly alkaline.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 67 to 72 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where the moist color value and chroma are less than 3.5, the thickness is less than 10 inches or the organic matter content is less than 1 percent.  The upper 10 inches of the Ap or A horizon ranges from fine sand to loam and below 10 inches the Ap or A horizon is dominantly loamy fine sand or fine sand with very thin strata of coarser or finer materials.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand and is stratified with thin strata of fine sandy loam to clay loam.  The thin strata are less than 1 inch thick, are darker in color, and contain more organic matter than the matrix."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Gaddy soils have mean annual soil temperature between 59 and 65 degrees F.  Coarsewood and Yahola soils contain more clay in the 10- to 40- inch particle size control section.  Lincoln and Sayers soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods (Typic)."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 38 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 240 to 280 days and, elevation ranges from 200 to 1,000 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64."

Ships soils are in the fine family and are farther from the stream channel in slightly higher positions.  Weswood are in the fine-silty family and are in positions slightly higher on the floodplain."
