  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 degrees to about 53 degrees F.  Coarse fragments, dominantly pebbles, in the particle- size control section range from 55 to 75 percent by volume.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly coarse sand or very gravelly sandy loam and subhorizons of sandy loam do not extend into the particle-size control section.  It has weak granular or blocky structure or is single grained.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 through 5.  it is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  it is extremely gravelly sand or very gravelly sand."

Netrac soils have a volcanic ash surface layer that is neutral.  Snoqualmie and Wiseman soils lack a Bw horizon.  Wiseman soils are 40 to 80 percent phyllite channers in the particle-size control section."

Grove soils are in a mild marine climate; summer is cool and dry and the winter is mild and wet.  mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 80 inches and fog is common especially from late summer through winter.  The growing season about 28 degrees F.  is 160 to 215 days and frost-free season about 32 degrees F. is 160 to 180 days."
