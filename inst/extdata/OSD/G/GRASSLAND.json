    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Grassland soils were previously mapped as Lignum soils. The change from thermic to mesic temperature regime resulted in the Lignum series being moved to due to larger extent in the thermic region. The typical pedon site for Grassland remains as the original site for the Lignum series in Orange County, Virginia.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 28 inches (Bt horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 61 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData Map Unit ID (type location):\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSoil Name   Slope Airtemp\tFrFr/Seas\tPrecip\tElevation\nGrassland\t0-15\t52-59\t\t165-200\t40-50\t\t400-800\nFloodL FloodH \tWatertable\tKind  \tMonths  \tBedrock \tHardness\nNone\t\t\t1.0-2.5\tPerched\tDec-May\t40-60\t\tSoft\nDepth\tTexture\t\t3-Inch\tNo-10\t\tClay%\t\t-CEC-\n0-4\tvfsl,l,sil\t\t0-0\t\t75-100\t10-25\n4-7\tl,sil,cl,sicl\t0-0\t\t75-100\t10-35\n7-28\tcl,sicl,sic,c\t0-0\t\t75-100\t27-55\n28-37\tl,sil,sicl\t\t0-0\t\t75-100\t10-35\n37-51\tvfsl,l,sil\t\t0-0\t\t75-100\t10-25\n51-87 WB\n87\tUWB\nDepth\t-pH-\t\tO.M.\tSalin\tPermeab\tShnk-Swll\n0-4\t4.5-5.5 \t.5-2.\t0- 0\t0.6- 2.0\tLOW\n4-7\t4.5-5.5 \t0-.5\t0- 0\t0.6- 2.0\tLOW\n7-28  4.5-5.5  \t0.-.5 0- 0  0.0-0.06  \tMODERATE\n28-37 4.5-5.5\t0.-.5 0- 0  0.2- 0.6  \tLOW\n37-51\t4.5-5.5\t0.-.5 0- 0  0.2- 0.6  \tLOW\n51-87\n87\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
