Cabool and Jessietown soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Chillum, Metapeake, and Nassawango soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and formed in marine or coastal sediments. Fletcher soils are deep or very deep to a lithic contact. Whitley soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and formed in materials derived from bedrock. Wernock soils compete very closely, but typically have a hue of 5YR, and typically average more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."
