    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cabool , Chillum, Fletcher, Jessietown, Matapeake, Nassawango, Wernock, and Whitley soils. Cabool and Jessietown soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Chillum, Metapeake, and Nassawango soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and formed in marine or coastal sediments. Fletcher soils are deep or very deep to a lithic contact. Whitley soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and formed in materials derived from bedrock. Wernock soils compete very closely, but typically have a hue of 5YR, and typically average more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

    "content": "REMARKS: Gnawbone soils were previously correlated as Gilpin soils underlain with a paralithic contact. Geological Survey Occasional Paper 43 from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources describes the bedrock in Indiana (Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group).\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from approximately 3 to 18 cm (1 to 7 inches), (A horizon); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from approximately 18 to 89 cm (7 to 35 inches), (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons); and 3) Paralithic contact: the zone where soil meets soft bedrock at 99 cm (39 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for this pedon, S88IN-143-005 is available at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
