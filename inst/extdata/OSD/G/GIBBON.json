  "OVERVIEW": "The Gibbon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys of Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (53 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 690 millimeters (27 inches) at the type location.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (Ap and A horizon)\nAquic soil conditions: 46 to 200 centimeters (18 to 79 inches) (Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons).\nPhases recognized include saline, saline-alkali, and overwash. These soils generally are not saturated at depths between 38 to 50 centimeters (15 to 20 inches) during the growing season. In the Saline phase, the Electrical Conductivity is 2 to 8 millimhos per centimeters and the Sodium Adsorption Ratio is 10 to 15 above 65 centimeters, decreasing with depth.\nKeys to soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010\n10/17/05 JCR\nChanged to semi-tab format, added metric conversions and changed from permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity\n7/27/2011 JLG\nAdd Additional Data, split out the Cg horizon in range of characteristics, and up-dated geographic setting data. Changed mean annual soil temperature from 9 to 11 degrees to 10 to 14 degrees. Changed episaturation to endosaturation based on the water table is not perched.  Added depth to redox depletions.  Added clay and sand content and particle control section. Separated AC and Cg horizons and added very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam as textures to the Cg horizons based on textures of the type location and field data. In the Cg horizon changed clay content from 18 to 32 to 35 percent and changed sand content from 5 to 45 to 5 to 75 percent. We expanded range of mean annual temperature from 12 to 13 degrees and mean annual precipitation from 760 to 850  millimeters. Expanded frost free days from 170 days to 190 days. Updated differences of soils in Geographically Associated soils section. Added keys to soil taxonomy version. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Additional laboratory data- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska pedons: 85NE163205\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
