  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crispy, Cucamungo, Pinew, Quopant, and Trailamp series.\nCrispy soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel (5 to 75 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments which are metamorphic rocks, and have paralithic materials of weathered schist or gneiss in the series control section.  Cucamungo soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer due to convection storms.  Pinew soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel (5 to 75 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments which are volcanic rocks, and have paralithic materials of weathered tuff or andesite in the series control section.  Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon and have paralithic materials of weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section.  Trailamp soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm, have paralithic materials of siltstone or shale in the series control section, and are intermittently moist during the summer due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grandridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,450 to 3,350 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 750 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
