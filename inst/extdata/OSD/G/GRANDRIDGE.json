  "OVERVIEW": "The Grandridge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Grandridge soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",

Cucamungo soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer due to convection storms.  Pinew soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel (5 to 75 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments which are volcanic rocks, and have paralithic materials of weathered tuff or andesite in the series control section.  Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon and have paralithic materials of weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section.  Trailamp soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm, have paralithic materials of siltstone or shale in the series control section, and are intermittently moist during the summer due to convection storms."
