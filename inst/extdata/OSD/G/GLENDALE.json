  "OVERVIEW": "The Glendale series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Glendale soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
