  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moist control section for 60 to 90 days during the summer in most years. The particle size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches and may include all or part of the argillic horizon. Depth to soft powdery secondary lime is 20 to 35 inches.\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. The soil structure is prismatic or angular blocky. The texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The soil structure is prismatic or angular blocky. The texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel. The soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It has 5 to 10 percent CaCO3 equivalent.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The texture is loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent gravel. The soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Btb horizon, when present, has similar colors, textures, and reactions as the C horizon. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel."
