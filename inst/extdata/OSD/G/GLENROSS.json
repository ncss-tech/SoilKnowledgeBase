  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent in the solum.  Sandstone fragments as much as 2 inches in diameter are scattered throughout the solum and substrata in some pedons.  Sandstone boulders up to 3 feet in diameter are in the substrata of some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  It ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Faint or distinct mottles are throughout the Bt horizon.  Typically it is sandy clay loam, but is fine sandy loam or clay loam in some pedons.  It averages between 18 and 35 percent clay and 40 to 65 percent sand coarser than very fine.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon.\nThe Bz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  It has few to common fine nests and striations of gypsum and other salts.  It ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5 or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam and typically grades to loamy fine sand or fine sand below 40 inches.  It has few to common accumulations of gypsum and other salts, especially in the upper part.  It ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."
