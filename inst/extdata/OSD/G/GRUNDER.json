  "OVERVIEW": "The Grunder series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium from quartzite, non-calcareous sandstone and/or non-calcareous siltstone. Grunder soils are on north and east facing slopes of hills and mountains. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Primeaux soils have 35 to 60 percent gravel in the lower portion of the solum and are in areas that average 14 to 16 inches of annual precipitation. Rammel soils are channery, cobbly or stony in the argillic horizon and have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulation.   Shotgun soils are in areas that average 25 to 30 inches of annual precipitation and were formed on loess covered basalt plains."
