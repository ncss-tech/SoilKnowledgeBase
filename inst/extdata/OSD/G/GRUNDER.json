Monida and Tingey soils are very deep and have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulation. Newlands soils are deep to bedrock. Primeaux soils have 35 to 60 percent gravel in the lower portion of the solum and are in areas that average 14 to 16 inches of annual precipitation. Rammel soils are channery, cobbly or stony in the argillic horizon and have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulation.   Shotgun soils are in areas that average 25 to 30 inches of annual precipitation and were formed on loess covered basalt plains."
