  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 100 inches.  Depth to the horizon containing plinthite ranges from 45\nto 60 inches.  Nodules of ironstone, 2 to 20 mm. in diameter,\nrange from 0 to 5 percent by volume throughout the solum.\nThe A horizons are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThey range from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The A1\nhorizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR\n6/2), brown (10YR 5/3), or dark brown (10YR 4/3, 3/3).\nThe A21 and A22 horizons are very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, 5/8), with few to common mottles of strong brown, brown, yellowish red, and red.  The mottles are slightly more\nloamy material than the surrounding soil material.\nThe B1 horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), brownish\nyellow (10YR 5/6, 5/8), mottled yellowish red, reddish yellow,\nred, or brown.  The mottled areas contain more clay than the surrounding material.  This horizon is loamy fine sand, sandy\nloam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon is reticulately mottled red, gray, and brown.  It ranges from sandy clay loam to sandy loam containing 18 to 35\npercent clay and less than 20 percent silt.  The reaction ranges\nfrom medium acid through very strongly acid.  Plinthite comprises from 35 to 50 percent of the horizon and is brittle when moist and extremely hard when dry.  Some pedons contain thin B21t horizons\nthat are strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8), or brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8), with few to many\ndark red, red, reddish brown, or yellowish red mottles."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Bonifay soils have 5 to 25 percent brittle plinthite in\nthe B2t horizon.  Boy and Pickton soils have more than 35 percent base saturation in the Bt horizon.  Conroe, Fuquay, and Tenaha\nsoils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick and in addition, Conroe has more than 35 percent clay in the control section.\nDarco soils have redder, less mottled, Bt horizons and contain\nless than 5 percent plinthite.  Lakeland soils lack B2t horizons."

The soil formed in unconsolidated acid sandy clay loams and sands.  The climate is\nhumid with an average annual rainfall ranging from 40 to 60\ninches.  The mean annual temperature of 66 degrees to 70 degrees\nF; and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."
