  "REVDATE": "07/2010",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grimstone series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from noncalcareous, moderately fine textured very micaceous bedrocks.  These soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
