  "OVERVIEW": "The Gypimack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Gypimack soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
