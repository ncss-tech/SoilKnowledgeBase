  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaines series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in materials weathered from folded limestone. Gaines soils are on ridge tops, crests and saddles of limestone hills and mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
