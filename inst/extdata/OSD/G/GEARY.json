  "OVERVIEW": "The Geary series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  Geary soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
