  "OVERVIEW": "The Garlock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from mixed alluvium.  Garlock soils are on old stream terraces and alluvial fans in the Mojave Desert and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches, some in the form of snow, and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
