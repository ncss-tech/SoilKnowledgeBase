    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 12 and 24 inches is dry from mid May until the end of November.  Mean annual soil temperature is 63 degrees to 72 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  Lime occurs below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons. Clay content in the control section averages 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown light yellowish brown or light brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/4).  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam and has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  It is usually massive but the surface inch or two has weak platy or fine granular structure in some pedons.\nThe AB or Bt1 horizon is brown, yellowish brown, strong brown, light yellowish brown or light brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6).  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam, and has 12 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent rock fragments ranging from 2mm to 5mm in diameter.\nThe Bt2 horizon is brown, yellow, strong brown, or reddish yellow (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8).  It is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam and has 22 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent gravel.

Bucklebar and Palomas soils have hues of 5YR through 2.5YR in the B2t horizon.  Avenal, Dutchflat, Milham and Neuralia soils are calcareous in the Bt horizon.  Hi Vista soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Lanip and Poachie soils are calcareous within 40 inches and the moisture control section is intermitantly moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative within July to September."
