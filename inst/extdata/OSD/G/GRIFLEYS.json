  "OVERVIEW": "The Grifleys series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from limestone and quartzite. Grifleys soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
