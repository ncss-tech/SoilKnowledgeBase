  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guanica series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on basin floors of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA. They formed in clayey alluvial sediments weathered from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
