    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Aguirre, Cartagena, Fe, and Fraternidad soils.  Aguirre, Cartagena, and Fraternidad soils do not have salt accumulation in the subsoil.  In addition, Cartagena soils have less clay in the control section and mixed mineralogy.  Fraternidad soils are moderately well drained, are not saline, and have less clay in the control section.  Fe soils have less clay in the control section and are moderately saline at depths of 5 to 8 inches."
