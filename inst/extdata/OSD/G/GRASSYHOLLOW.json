  "OVERVIEW": "The Grassyhollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum weathered from conglomerate.   These soils are on escarpments and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
