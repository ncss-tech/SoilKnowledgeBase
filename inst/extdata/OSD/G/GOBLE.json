  "OVERVIEW": "The Goble series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty loess over old alluvium of mixed origin. Goble soils are on long convex upland slopes and ridgetops and have slopes of 2 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 percent and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a dry period of less than 45 days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 55 degrees F. The depth to the fragipan ranges from 30 to 45 inches. The soil is more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically silty clay loam, but includes silt loam in the upper part. None to few faint mottles with chroma of 3 or 4 in hue of 5YR are near the boundary with the fragipan in some pedons. This horizon has a smeary feel when moist.\nThe Btx horizon (fragipan) has matrix colors similar to the horizon above it, but has distinct and prominent mottles with chroma of 2. It is hard, very firm, and has a brittle feel. Clay films on prism faces and fractures are common or continuous and thin. The fragipan is normally more than one foot thick and overlies old alluvium or loess, and residual material of mixed origin."

Dollar soils are fine-loamy. Kinton and Powell soils have ochric epipedons and xeric moisture regimes. Also, Powell soils are mottled at depths of 20 to 30 inches."

The soils formed in loess over mixed old alluvium or slope wash. The soils formed under a cool moist winter and a warm dry summer climate. Average July temperature is 64 degrees F., average January temperature is 34 degrees F., average annual temperature is 49 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 60 to 75 inches.
