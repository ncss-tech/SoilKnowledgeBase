  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on river flood plains, flood plain steps, levees and low river terraces that are subject to rare to occasional flooding.  The Green River soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,800 to 6,600 feet (1,158 to 2,012 meters). The climate is arid or semiarid.  Mean annual temperature is 44 to 54 degrees F (6.7 to 12.2 degrees C).  The freeze-free period ranges from 90 to 175 days.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 12 inches (13 to 30 cm) with peak periods in July to October and evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the year."
