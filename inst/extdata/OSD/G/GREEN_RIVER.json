  "OVERVIEW": "The Green River series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks.  These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps, levees and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. (8.9 degrees C.), and the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches (18 cm).",
