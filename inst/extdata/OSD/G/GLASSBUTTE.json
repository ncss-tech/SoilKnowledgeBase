  "OVERVIEW": "The Glassbutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite. Glassbutte soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
