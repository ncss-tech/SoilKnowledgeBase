  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glassbutte soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite or rhyodacite. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,415 to 1,895 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 meters, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
