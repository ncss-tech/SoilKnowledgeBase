  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Breakneck, Burton, Cataloochee, Oconaluftee, Tanasee, and Wayah series. Breakneck soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Burton and Wayah soils formed in residuum and Tanasee in colluvium from high-grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Cataloochee soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Oconaluftee, Tanasee and Wayah soils have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Guyot soils are on strongly sloping to very steep summits and side slopes of mountains in the higher elevations of the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Elevation ranges from about 4,500 to 6,600 feet. On north and east aspects this soil may occur at somewhat lower elevations. Slope ranges from 8 to 95 percent. Guyot soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as thinly bedded metasandstone, quartzite, slate, and phyllite. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches near the type location. Moist atmospheric conditions are prevalent and fog is common in these high mountain areas."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Breakneck, Cataloochee, and Oconaluftee series, these include the Chiltoskie, Clingman, Heintooga, Horsetrough, Pinnacle, and Pullback series. Chiltoskie, Heintooga, and Horsetrough soils formed in colluvium. Heintooga soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Horsetrough soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and are poorly drained. Clingman and Pinnacle soils are comprised of organic soil material. Pullback soils formed in residuum and have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Cataloochee soils have paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is in forest. Common trees at the lower elevation range are northern red oak, black birch, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye. At higher elevations, red spruce and fraser fir become the dominant tree species. In many areas the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized. The understory species are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, pin cherry, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, silverbell, blueberry, and flame azalea. Common forbs are hay-scented fern, wood fern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium. A small acreage is covered by heath balds vegetated with rhododendron, flame azalea, blueberry, hawthorn, and mountain ash."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Guyot series was formerly included with the Oconaluftee series. However, Oconaluftee soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Fine-loamy particle-size class placement is based on the presence of amorphous (non-crystalline) clay-size material associated with the relatively high organic matter content found in these soils. Although field estimates, laboratory measurements, and calculated values may vary, clay content in the particle-size control section is generally less than 25 percent. Although Guyot soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nThe Guyot series has the following diagnostic horizons:\nUmbric epipedon - The zone from the mineral surface to 11 inches (Al, and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 11 to 28  inches below the surface (Bw and BC horizon).\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 59 inches (upper boundary of Cr horizon).\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from NSSC-SSL sample SNC00-087-001.\nNASIS Site ID: 113874\nNASIS Pedon ID: 114698\nNASIS User Pedon ID: Guyot OSD\nNASIS DMU ID: 410010 (Standard Component Data)\nMLRA=130B\n02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
