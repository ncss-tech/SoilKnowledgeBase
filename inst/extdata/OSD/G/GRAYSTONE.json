  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Graystone soils typically effervesce throughout but some pedons may be leached in the A horizon where it is not cultivated.  The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.  The soil is usually dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. It is dry for 60 consecutive days between July 1 and October 15 in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or occasionally sandy loam with 6 to 18 percent clay.  The range of fine and coarser sand is 15 to 35 percent. The calcic horizon averages 10 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  The reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."
