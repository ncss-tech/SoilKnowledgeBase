  "OVERVIEW": "The Gracemont series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately or moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous sandy and loamy alluvium of Recent age.  These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on narrow flood plains of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A) and the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78C).  Water runs off the surface slowly.  They are saturated late in winter and early in spring. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.  In some pedons, the upper 10 inches of the soil is leached of lime and is neutral or slightly alkaline. Saline phases are recognized.  The Ab horizon, where present, occurs at depths below 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where the moist color value and chroma is less than 3.5, the thickness is less than 10 inches.  Texture of the upper 10 inches of the A horizon is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, and the overwash phase has silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay and below 10 inches is fine sandy loam or loam. The electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 0 to 16 dS/m (mmhos/cm).\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam stratified with thin strata of coarser or finer material. The electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 0 to 16 dS/m (mmhos/cm).\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Below 40 inches clay loam is included.  The Ab horizon is absent in some pedons."

Soils in similar families are Boggy (OK), Gracemore (OK), Kiomatia (TX), Norwood (TX), Oklared (OK), Pulaski (OK), Tribbey (OK), Tullahassee (OK), and Yahola (OK) series.  Boggy, Tribbey, and Tullahassee soils are noncalcareous throughout the control section.  In addition, Boggy soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Kiomatia soils have a sandy control section and lack a water table within 40 inches of the surface.  Gracemore soils have a sandy control section.  Norwood soils are fine-silty.  Oklared, Pulaski, and Yahola soils lack a water table above 40 inches most of the time.  In addition, Pulaski soils are noncalcareous in the control section."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 32 to 64. Frost free days range from 185 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 2300 feet."

These soils have endosaturation within 40 inches of the surface most of the year and within 18 inches from November through May.  Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is moderately rapid or moderate.  The soils are frequently or occasionally flooded; duration is brief or very brief during months of March through August."
