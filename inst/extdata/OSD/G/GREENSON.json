  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe average annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F., and the average summer temperatures is 62 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice in normal years.\nThe mollic epipedon is 11 to 19 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and Bw horizons is 16 to 25 inches. The control section averages loam or silt loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The soils are saturated within 40 inches for more than 90 days when not frozen, unless artificially drained. The water table commonly occurs between 30 to 40 inches if the soil has not been drained.\nThe A horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, but the chroma is usually less than 2. They have 3 to 9 percent organic matter and weak to moderate, fine to medium, granular or subangular blocky structure. They are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam or silt loam. It has weak, very fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. It is slightly to moderately alkaline and slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It has few faint to many medium distinct mottles. It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam and is gravelly below 38 inches in some pedons. It is moderately to strongly alkaline, and strongly to violently effervescent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 16 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 16 to 23 inches (Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 23 to 51 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 60 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk1, Bk2, and C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw and Bk1 horizons and parts of the A and Bk2 horizons).\nThis revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Calciustolls based on depth to aquic conditions deeper than 30 inches and the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.  Laboratory data of the typical pedon verifies the activity class.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 178-179, Table 7 of the Soil Survey of Cache Valley Area, Utah, Parts of Cache and Box Elder Counties.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
