  "OVERVIEW": "The Galuche series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Galuche soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

(E horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 19 inches. (E and Bw horizons)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 11 to 19 inches.  (part of the Bw horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with granite, gneiss, and schist at 19 inches.  (R layer)\nThis series was originally classified as a loamy-skeletal, mixed, shallow Typic Ustochrept. Additional documentation identifies a lithic contact as typical for the area.  Data on similar soils suggests paramicaceous mineralogy.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
