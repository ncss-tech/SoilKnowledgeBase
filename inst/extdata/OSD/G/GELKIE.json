They lack an argillic horizon.  Feltonia soils are on fans below the Gelkie soils and they have a thicker mollic epipedon, more sand, and a calcic horizon.  Silvercliff soils are on terrace escarpments and side slopes below the Gelkie soils.  They have more than 35 percent coarser fragments and a calcic horizon."

(Bt, Btk horizons)\nSecondary carbonate accumulations: from 28 to 45 inches (Btk, Bk horizons)\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 35 inches.  (upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)\nClassification of the Gelkie series when established was fine-loamy, mixed Argic Cryoborolls.\nThe 03/2007 revision narrows the series to its original landforms and parent material. Soils on mountains and glacial moraines are no longer considered within the series. Also excluded from the series are soils with peak periods of moisture in spring and early summer, which typically have sagebrush plant communities.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
