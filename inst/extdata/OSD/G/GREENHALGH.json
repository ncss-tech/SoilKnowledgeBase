  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Clay in the particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.,  and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter months, and dry in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at a 20 inch depth is more than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR.  Value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mostly silt loam and loam, but some pedons include sandy loam below depth of 40 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is mainly 3 to 15 percent but ranges to 25 percent in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenhalgh soils are on low lying alluvial fans and valley floors.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 7,600 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."
