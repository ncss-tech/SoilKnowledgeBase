  "OVERVIEW": "The Gordo series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium and colluvium overlying weathered basalt and cinders.  These soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
