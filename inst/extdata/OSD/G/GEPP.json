  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 90 inches.  The chert content, by volume, ranges from 10 to 75 percent in the A and E horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the Bt horizons.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and  very strongly acid to medium acid in the upper B horizons and is strongly acid or medium acid in the lower Bt horizons. The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 4. Some pedons have A horizons, 1 to 3 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have E horizons 4 to 8 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 4, 5, or 6 and chroma 2, 3, or 4.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly silt loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4 or 6 or hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 6 or with value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, or hue of 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 6 or value or 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6 or 8 with mottles in shades of red and brown.  Some pedons have gray mottles at depths of 35 inches or greater.  The lower Bt horizons are clay or gravelly clay and can have a color hue as red as 10R."
