Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid in the horizons above the fragipan and from strongly acid to moderately acid in the Btx horizon.  Some pedons have less than 5 percent rounded gravel in the pedon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The horizon has few to many redoximorphic features as iron depletions of chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe B/E horizon; in the B part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The E part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 or less.  Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown and gray.

Busseltown and Freeland do not have redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. The Necessity and Bude series has a fine-silty particle size control section.  Hatchie soils are very similar but it has a fine-silty particle size control section."
