Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid in the horizons above the fragipan and from strongly acid to moderately acid in the Btx horizon.  Some pedons have less than 5 percent rounded gravel in the pedon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The horizon has few to many redoximorphic features as iron depletions of chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe B/E horizon; in the B part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.
