  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to an indurated, lime-silica cemented duripan ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  These soils are dry throughout from June until late November for about 180 days.  The soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F from March to mid-December for about 290 days.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/3, 6/4; or 7.5YR 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4,, 6/3; 7.5YR 4/4, or 5/4.  The upper 3 to 4 inches of the A horizon consists of a vesticular layer of very stony loam to very gravelly loam.  Rock fragments 2 mm to 7 cm in diameter range from 35 to 60 percent; 7 cm-25 cm 1 to 5 percent, and 25 cm+ up to 15 percent in the upper part of the A horizon.  The lower part of the horizon ranges from gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly sand.\nThe Bk horizon has colors similar to the A horizon.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loamy sand.\nUnderlying the 2Bqkm horizon is mixed, extremely gravelly, stratified alluvium that is massive and extremely hard or very hard when dry.  It can be dug with a pick and shovel, but with difficulty."

Elevations are 1,800 feet to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with very hot dry summers, with infrequent thunder showers of short duration, and cool slightly moist winters.  The average annual precipitation varies from 4 to 12 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F, mean July temperature is 85 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 235 to 300 days.  Those soils formed on hillslopes up to 40 percent slopes and 12 inches of precipitation occur in the Sonoran Desert."
