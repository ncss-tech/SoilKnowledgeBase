  "OVERVIEW": "The Ganado series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent but are dominantly less than 1. Mean annual precipitation is , mean annual air temperature is about.",
