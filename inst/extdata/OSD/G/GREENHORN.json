The mean summer soil temperature varies from 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from about May 1 to December 1.  These soils are usually saturated during the late winter and spring due to a seasonal water table at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are highly stratified and include textures of silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sand and fine sand.  The 10 to 40 inch control section when mixed is sandy loam or loam with a weighted average clay content of 8 to 15 percent and 50 to 60 percent sand.  Depth to mottles is 0 to 11 inches.  Depth to buried A horizons is 26 to 50 inches.  One or more Ab horizons are present.  Iron segreations, 2 to 15 mm in diameter, range from 1 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 or 4/4.  Horizons with dry color of 10YR 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 are less than 4 inches thick and are at a depth of less than 10 inches.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam.\nIn the 10 to 30 inch part, 80 percent or more of the matrix has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 6/4, 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.  Twenty percent or less of the 10 to 30 inch part has moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2 or N2/.\nBelow a depth of 30 inches, dry color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/4, 6/4; 2.5Y 7/2 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/4; 5Y 2.5/1, 2.5/2, 3/2, 4/2, 4/3 or N2/.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Most of the areas mapped are forming in material deposited downstream from hydraulic mining operations conducted in the 1860s and 1870s.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 34 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
