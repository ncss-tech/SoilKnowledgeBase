  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  Cracks as much as 1/2 inch in width extend to a depth of about 15 inches during long dry periods. Rock fragments, channers and flagstones of limestone and chert, range from 0 to 15 percent in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.   A horizons that have value of less than 4 are less than 6 inches thick.   Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Eroded or severely eroded pedons are silty clay or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, olive or gray may be present in the lower part of some pedons.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  The upper few inches is silty clay loam in most pedons.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or olive.  Texture is clay or silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Archer, Bradyville, Conasauge, Mimosa, Talbott, and Winnsboro series which are in the same family.  Archer soils formed in coastal plain sediments, have a sandy loam to sand surface layer, and significantly more sand in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Bradyville and Mimosa soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Conasauga soils do not have hard limestone bedrock within a depth of 60 inches.  Talbott soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Winnesboro soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 70 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gladdice soils are on uplands extending from the edge of the Highland Rim down into the outer Central Basin and on outlying knobs and hills within the inner Central Basin.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The soils have formed in residuum weathered from limestone.  Average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 49 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashwood, Barfield, Dellrose, Hawthorne and Mimosa soils.  Ashwood soils, in similar positions, have a mollic epipedon.  Barfield soils, in similar positions, are less than 20 inches deep to hard bedrock.  Dellrose soils, generally on higher slightly concave side slopes and benches, are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.  Hawthorne soils, on higher lying hillsides and ridge tops are loamy-skeletal.  Mimosa soils, on similar positions and on higher lying hillsides, are 40 to 60 inches to hard bedrock."
