The soils formed in mixed fine textured sediments derived from acid and basic igneous rocks.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches that falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  The frost-free period ranges from 170 to 280 days."

Vegetation is mesquite, creosotebush, catclaw, salt cedar, tobosa grass, and annuals.  Some areas are nearly barren, but in other places the growth of tobosa is sufficient to give the appearance of small \"tobosa flats\"."
