  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is less than 8 inches.   Depth to gravelly material ranges from 5 to 12 inches.  The texture of the substratum ranges from gravelly clay loam to gravelly sandy loam.  Texture of the A and B horizons is fine sandy loam in places.  Colors in the B horizon are normally patchy with hues of 5YR to 7.5YR, chromas of 2 to 4, and values of 2 to 4. COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Caswell series in the same subgroup. Caswell soils have solums thicker than 8 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grewingk soils are cold, wet soils on steep north-facing slopes.  They usually remain frozen until mid-summer. Slope ranges from 12 to 45 percent.  The regolith is gravelly glacial drift mantled with a few inches of silty ash-influenced loess.  Grewingksoils ccur in a maritime or maritime-continental transitional climate with cool summers and long moderately cold winters."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Cohoe, Moose River, and Mutnala soils.  Cohoe and Mutnala soils are well drained silty Spodosols of adjacent uplands.  Moose River soils are mottled, have no spodic horizon, and occupy the floodplains of valley floors."

The ground cover consists of willows, Labrador tea, bog birch and other shrubs and forbs.  A thick layer of sphagnum moss covers the surface in most places."
