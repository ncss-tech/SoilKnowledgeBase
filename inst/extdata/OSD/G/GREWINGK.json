  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grewingk series consists of deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a silty eolian mantle overlying stratified till deposits on moraine sideslopes and escarpments.  Slopes range from 12 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is less than 8 inches.   Depth to gravelly material ranges from 5 to 12 inches.  The texture of the substratum ranges from gravelly clay loam to gravelly sandy loam.  Texture of the A and B horizons is fine sandy loam in places.  Colors in the B horizon are normally patchy with hues of 5YR to 7.5YR, chromas of 2 to 4, and values of 2 to 4. COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Caswell series in the same subgroup. Caswell soils have solums thicker than 8 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grewingk soils are cold, wet soils on steep north-facing slopes.  They usually remain frozen until mid-summer. Slope ranges from 12 to 45 percent.  The regolith is gravelly glacial drift mantled with a few inches of silty ash-influenced loess.  Grewingksoils ccur in a maritime or maritime-continental transitional climate with cool summers and long moderately cold winters."
