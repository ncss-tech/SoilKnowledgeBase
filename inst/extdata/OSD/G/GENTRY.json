Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, medium acid to moderately alkaline in the B2t\nhorizon and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 2 or 3, chroma 1 or 2 or hue of N, value 1 or 2.  Some pedons have few to common, fine to coarse mottles of very dark gray, gray of grayish brown and pockets of gray, light gray, white or grayish brown uncoated sand grains.  Texture is sand or fine sand. Thickness ranges from 20 to 28 inches.\nThe B2tg horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 through 5, chroma 1 or 2; hue 5Y, value 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2; hue 2.5Y, value 3 or 4 and chroma 2 or hue N, value 3 or 4.  Tongues of black or very\ndark gray from the A horizon extend into this horizon.  Tongues range from 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter and from 1 1/4 to 30 inches in length.  Few to common, fine to coarse gray, grayish brown and olive gray pockets of sand or fine sand are in this horizon in some pedons.  Mottles of yellow, gray, brown and olive are also is this horizon in some pedons.  Texture, excluding tongues, is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Combined texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 through 7, chroma 1 or 2; hue 2.5Y, value 4 through 6, chroma 2; or hue N, value 4 through 6.

Delray soils have A horizons 40 to 80 inches thick. Riviera and Winder soils lack mollic epipedons and have glossic properties.  Nittaw soils have clayey argillic horizons.  Tomoka soils are organic."
