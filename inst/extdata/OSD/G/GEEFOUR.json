    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Geefour soils are on erosional hillslopes above desert basin floors at elevations of 1,800 to 4,560 feet. Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent. These soils formed in shale/mudstone of the Pen, Del Rio, and Javelina formations (Cretaceous), and the Banta Shut-in and similar formations (Tertiary). The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, and most precipitation occurs mainly as afternoon thunderstorms during the summer and early fall months. The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castolon, Corazones, and Vicente series. Castolon and Vicente soils are very deep, and occur on the Rio Grande flood plain. Castolon soils have fine-silty control sections. Corazones soils contain than more 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are on higher, older pediments and fans. Vicente soils have coarse-silty control sections."
