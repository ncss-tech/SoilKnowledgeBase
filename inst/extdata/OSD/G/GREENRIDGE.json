  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the loess ranges from 25 to 60 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 45 to 80 inches but is typically more than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments are absent in the loess mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the slope alluvium and residuum.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nWhere present, the E horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 29 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 10GY, or 5G; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or the channery analogs.  Also included are thin layers of loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Volume of channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent.\nIn some pedons C horizons are present.  Textures are loamy fine sand and fine sand. Color and reaction are similar to the 2Bt horizons.  Volume of channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe underlying bedrock consists of fine-grained glauconitic sandstone and has color similar to the 2Bt horizon above.  Narrow joints containing residuum are common in the sandstone.  The sandstone becomes more cemented with depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baraboo, Bertrand, Blackhammer, Camden, Dubuque, Fayette, Flagg,  Jackson, Jemerson, LaFarge, Lambeau(T), Martinsburg, Menfro, Navlys, Palsgrove, Pepin, Piscasaw, Ridgeway, Rozetta, Ruma, Rush, Russell, Seaton, St. Charles, Stookey, Sylvan, and Yellowriver series.  All of these soils, except the LaFarge soils, do not have soil color hues of 5Y, 5YG, 10GY, or 5G in the lower part of the series control section. These hues are associated with residuum weathered from glauconitic sandstone.  The LaFarge soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenridge soils are on hills on highly dissected bedrock controlled uplands.  Slopes range from 4 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loess and in the underlying slope alluvium and loamy residuum.  Residuum weathered from the underlying fine-grained glauconitic sandstone (typically the Tunnel City sandstone that is identified), in part by it's high content of glauconitic minerals.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1200 feet."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate in the loess, moderate to moderately rapid in the slope alluvium and residuum, and ranges from slow to moderate in the sandstone."

Some of the LaFarge soils that have a thick loess mantle may fit the concept of the Greenridge series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
