  "OVERVIEW": "The Gogomain series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in sandy and loamy glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying clayey calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the soil and very slow in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
