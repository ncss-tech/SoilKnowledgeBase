  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodwater series consists of shallow to cemented pan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Goodwater soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 millimeters (11 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (53 degrees F.).",
