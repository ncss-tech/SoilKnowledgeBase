  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches. Rock fragment content above the fragipan commonly is less than 5 percent but may range to 15 percent; in the fragipan 5 to 75 percent and below the fragipan 15 to 75 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or less.  It is moderately acid to very strongly acid, and is higher where limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 1 to 4 and is mottled.  Low chroma clay films cover the faces of peds where ped interiors have higher chroma.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam or their gravelly or cobbly analogues.  It is slightly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btx has mottled colors of red, gray and brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is typically very strongly acid to moderately acid, but can range as high as slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Ex or 2E horizon immediately above the 2Btx horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color similar to the fragipan.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam or the gravelly and cobbly to extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is very strongly acid to neutral."

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 42 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bado, Creldon, Carytown, Eldon, and Keeno soils.  Bado soils are on upland depressional areas.  Creldon soils commonly are on more sloping positions.  Carytown and Eldon soils do not have fragipans. Carytown soils are on depressions and Eldon soils are on more sloping ridgetops.  Keeno soils are better drained, have more rock fragments and are on steeper slopes."
