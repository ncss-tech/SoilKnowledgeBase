  "STATES": "KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerald series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands and have a fragipan at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or loamy colluvium over residuum from cherty limestone in MLRAs 116B and 112. Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.",

Rock fragment content above the fragipan commonly is less than 5 percent but may range to 15 percent; in the fragipan 5 to 75 percent and below the fragipan 15 to 75 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or less.  It is moderately acid to very strongly acid, and is higher where limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 1 to 4 and is mottled.  Low chroma clay films cover the faces of peds where ped interiors have higher chroma.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam or their gravelly or cobbly analogues.  It is slightly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btx has mottled colors of red, gray and brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is typically very strongly acid to moderately acid, but can range as high as slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Ex or 2E horizon immediately above the 2Btx horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color similar to the fragipan.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam or the gravelly and cobbly to extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is very strongly acid to neutral."

Creldon soils commonly are on more sloping positions.  Carytown and Eldon soils do not have fragipans. Carytown soils are on depressions and Eldon soils are on more sloping ridgetops.  Keeno soils are better drained, have more rock fragments and are on steeper slopes."
