  "OVERVIEW": "The Grandview series consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium.  Grandview soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
