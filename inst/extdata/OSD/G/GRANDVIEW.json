Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 8 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
