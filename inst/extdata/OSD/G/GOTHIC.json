  "OVERVIEW": "The Gothic series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes, fan remnants, dip slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
