  "OVERVIEW": "The Gold Creek series consists of deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave portions of flood plains or low terraces.  The average annual precipitation at the type location is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Gold Creek soils usually are calcareous at the surface, but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos in a major part of the control section.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 30 percent in most of the control section.  Thin organic horizons generally occur at the surface but are absent in some pedons.  No continuous concentrated horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate are present within the control section, but some visible carbonate occurs at any depth as a characteristic of the parent material.  The control section is usually heavy silty clay loam or silty clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 45 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  COLE ranges from .05 to .09 and total potential extensibility exceeds 2.4 inches in the upper 50 inches.  The soils develop wide cracks in some seasons of most years.  Mean annual soil temperature is 37 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 48 degrees F. when undrained and without an 0 horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It has distinct to prominent mottling in some part.  This horizon ranges from mildly to very strongly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2 and has distinct or prominent mottles.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nA IIC horizon of sand and gravel underlies the solum at depths of 40 to 60 inches in many pedons."
