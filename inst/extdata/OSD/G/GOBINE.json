    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to the calcic horizon range from 21 to 29 inches.  Gravel ranges rom 0 to 10 percent in the control section. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 61 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 80 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice, and is moist for 45 to 60 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the winter solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly loam.  In some pedons there are loamy sand and very gravelly sandy loam layers below a depth of 40 inches.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Church Springs and Joes series in the same family and the similar Watkins Ridge series.  Church Springs soils have an argillic horizon and are 10 to 20 inches to the calcic horizon. Joes soils lack a cambic horizon and have a calcic horizon immediately below the mollic epipedon at a depth of 8 to 18 inches.  Watkins Ridge soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone, conglomerate, and limestone.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is 75 to 90 days."

Duckree and Dagan soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Thatcher soils have an argillic horizon.  Lakridge soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  Ellett soils lack a calcic horizon and are shallow to weathered shale."
