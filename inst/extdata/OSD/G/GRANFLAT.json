  "OVERVIEW": "The Granflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on outwash terraces and low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",
