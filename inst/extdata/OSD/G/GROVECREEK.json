  "OVERVIEW": "The Grovecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, landslides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
