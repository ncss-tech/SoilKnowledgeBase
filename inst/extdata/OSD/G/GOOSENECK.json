  "OVERVIEW": "The Gooseneck series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Gooseneck soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
