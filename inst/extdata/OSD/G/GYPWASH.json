  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gypwash soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolostone, and gypsum rock. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 2,500 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches, the mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
