Carroll, Myrtle, Nasset, Newhouse, Oak Center, Watkins, Waubeek, and Yutan series. Batavia soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in loamy stratified outwash or in sandy loam till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Bowes soils have 60 to 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Churchtown soils have 10 to 55 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Deroin, Downs, Mt. Carroll, and Watkins soils do not have zones within 152 cm (60 inches) of the surface that are frequently saturated for periods longer than one month. Ella soils have horizons with 15 to 60 percent sand in the series control section. Festina soils have more sand in the lower part of the series control section. Frankville soils have limestone bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches). Gladek soils have calcium carbonates within 152 cm (60 inches). Harvard soils have 30 to 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Hersey soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Knox soils are less acid in the series control section. Luana soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and underlying residuum weathered from arenaceous limestone and have a lithologic discontinuity. Mannon soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Massbach soils have a paralithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Mellott soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of silty material and underlying glaciofluvium and loamy glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Myrtle soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and late Sangamon reddish paleosols formed in sandy loam to loam or clay loam Illinoian glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Nasset soils have limestone bedrock within 140 cm (55 inches). Newhouse soils have 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Oak Center soils have a paralithic contact with siliceous sandstone within a depth of 201 centimeters (79 inches). Waubeek soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and underlying glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Yutan soils have surface layers with 35 to 40 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Greenbush soils occupy nearly level to moderately steep ridgetops and side slopes on till plains and on treads and risers of stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. They formed in loess that has been leached of carbonates to a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) or more. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 840 to 965 mm (33 to 38 inches)."

The Osco and Rozetta series are on similar positions and form a biosequence with Greenbush soils. Osco soils have a mollic epipedon. Rozetta soils have surface layers 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches thick)."
