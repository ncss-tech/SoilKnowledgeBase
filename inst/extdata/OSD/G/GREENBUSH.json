  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenbush series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess that has been leached of carbonates to a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) or more. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep ridgetops and side slopes on till plains and on treads and risers of stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).",
