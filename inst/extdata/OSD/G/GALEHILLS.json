Akela soils formed in alluvium from basalt and rhyolitic tuff with eolian influences and are usually dry between October and May. Beach soils receives moisture in the summer typical of the Chihuahua Desert. Dalvord soils formed from granite sources and have 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Haleburu soils formed from volcanic sources and have 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Hindu soils formed from limestone and are intermittently moist for more than 20 days between July and September. Hulda soils formed in alluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks, have 5 to 13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and receive 8 to 12 inches precipitation. Noble Pass soils formed from andesite and rhyolite and have 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Paintrocks soils formed from granitic residuum and have 0 to 1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Pearce soils formed in alluvium from limestone and are dominated by stones and cobbles. Razorback soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rocks and have less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent (NASIS data). Spripar soils formed from basalt and have 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Sutra soils formed from limestone, are 8 to 14 inches deep and have thin Bw horizons. Tecopa soils formed from quartzite, schists, and gneiss and have less than 1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Terlingua soils have a paralithic contact and formed from andesite and basalt. Upspring soils formed from extrusive basic igneous rocks and pyroclastic volcanic rocks, and have less than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Galehills soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone conglomerate. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,500 feet. The climate is low-lattitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
