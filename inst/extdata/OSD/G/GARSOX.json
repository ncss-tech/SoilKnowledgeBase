  "OVERVIEW": "The Garsox series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium. They are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
