  "OVERVIEW": "The Grubrob series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in eolian material deposited over interbedded sandstone, conglomerate, and limestone.  Grubrob soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
