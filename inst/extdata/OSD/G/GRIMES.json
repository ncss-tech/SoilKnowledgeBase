  "OVERVIEW": "The Grimes series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in very gravelly and cobbly alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Grimes soils are on river terraces, alluvial fans, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
