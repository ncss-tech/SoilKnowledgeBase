  "OVERVIEW": "The Garrett series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Pachic Argiustolls. Typically, Garrett soils have very friable, granular A horizons, reddish brown sandy clay loam B2t horizons having prismatic and subangular blocky structure, and light reddish brown sandy loam Cca horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches, depth to calcareous material ranges from 20 to 40 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The soil is 80 to 100 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 5 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature from 59 degrees to 78 degrees F. The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has granular structure but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is neutral or mildly alkaline. The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It usually has coarse prismatic structure, but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 75 percent, with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. It is neutral or mildly alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR. It has about 4 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate is weak but consistent from pedon to pedon. This horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  These soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and valley filling side slopes where materials have been weathered and locally transported from reddish brown sandstones and loamstones. Slope gradients are usually 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in moderately coarse textured calcareous alluvial sediments derived principally from reddish brown calcareous sedimentary rock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
