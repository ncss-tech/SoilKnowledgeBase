  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenwood series consists of very deep ,very poorly drained soils formed in organic deposits more than 51 inches thick on outwash plains, till floored lake plains, or lake plains.  These soils have moderate or moderately rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic layers are more than 51 inches thick.  The surface tier is commonly peat (fibric material) derived from sphagnum moss.  In some places, these layers are largely undecomposed sphagnum moss and in others they are stratified muck, mucky peat, and peat derived from both herbaceous plants and sphagnum moss. Muck, mucky peat, and peat types have been recognized.  The O layers have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4; colors become darker upon brief exposure to air.  Oi layers have the highest values and chromas.  In some pedons, colors after rubbing change from 0.5 to 1 unit in value or chroma or both.  The layers in the subsurface and bottom tiers are dominantly mucky peat (hemic material) derived from herbaceous plants.  In some pedons, layers of peat or muck have a combined thickness of less than 10 inches in the lower two tiers.  These layers have pH of 4.5 or less in 0.01M calcium chloride and commonly range from pH 3.5 to 4.5.  Fragments of woody material ranging from about 1 to 8 inches in diameter are throughout the control section.  Woody fibers comprise less than 50 percent of the organic volume after rubbing. There is no mineral soil material recognized in the profile."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are none.  The Burnt Vly, Citypoint, Dawson, Loxley and Pleasant Lake soils are in closely related families.  All of these soils are dominantly composed of sapric materials.  In addition,the Citypoint series has a lithic or paralithic contact within 60 inches and the Burnt Vly and Dawson soils have sandy mineral soil within 51 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenwood soils are in depressions that range in size from small enclosed bogs in moraines to areas of about 1,000 acres in size.  The larger areas commonly are on outwash plains, till floored lake plains, or lake plains. The mineral soils in the surrounding upland are generally derived from acid parent materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Then mean annual precipitation ranges from about 22 to 35 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about  36 to 45 degrees F. Frost free days range from 88 to 150. Elevation above sea level ranges from 600 to 1,600 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dawson, Deford, Kinross, and Roscommon soils.  Dawson soils are shallow organic soils in similar landscape positions underlain by sand at a depth of 16 to 50 inches.  The Deford, Kinross and Roscommon soils are poorly or very poorly drained sandy mineral soils in slightly higher landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.   The representative depth to wet soil moisture status is at the surface to 1 foot below the surface at some time throughout the year.  The representative depth of ponding is from 0 to 1.0 foot at some time throughout the year.  Surface runoff is negligible.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Very little use is made of these soils because of the extreme acidity and high water table.  Few trees except some black spruce and tamarack grow on these soils.  Ground cover is blueberries, bog rosemary, laurel, leatherleaf, and sphagnum mosses."
