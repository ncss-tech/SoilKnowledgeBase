The soil is slightly acid to strongly acid throughout, except for the surface layer in limed areas.  Content of rock fragments, commonly of slate, 1 to 4 inches or more in length, range from about 2 to 30 percent in the A horizon, 2 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon, and 20 to 55 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR but ranges to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow and brown.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8, with mottles in shades of red, yellow, gray, and brown.  Pedons with chroma of 2 have hue of 2.5YR.  The C horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is Carolina slate or fine-grained schist."

Brantley, Canton Bend, and Capshaw soils have a solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches.  Cowton soils are underlain by sandstone or shale of Pennsylvanian age and have a lithologic discontinuity in the Bt horizon.  Enon, Maben, Magnet, and Mecklenburg soils have slower permeability.  In addition, Enon and Mecklenburg soils are underlain by dark colored basic crystalline rock; Maben soils are underlain by stratified loamy and shaly clays; and Magnet soils have a Cr horizon in multicolored saprolite from syenite and other intrusive igneous rocks.  Hampshire soils are underlain by hard phosphatic limestone bedrock at depths of 40 to 65 inches.  Meth and Zuber soils have a solum thickness of more than 60 inches; and in addition are underlain by loamy and clayey marine sediments.  Spray soils have a solum thickness of 10 to 20 inches.  Zion soils are underlain by hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
