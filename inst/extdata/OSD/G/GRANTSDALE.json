  "OVERVIEW": "The Grantsdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
