  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the clayey part of the Bt horizon ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Depth to the bottom of the clayey Bt horizon exceeds 30 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact is more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Content of rock fragments ranges 0 to 20 percent in the A and E horizons, and 0 to 10 percent in the Bt, BC and C horizons.  Few fine flakes of mica are in the lower part of the solum of some pedons, and some pedons may have few fine manganese concretions in the surface and upper subsoil horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Where eroded, the A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 to 8.  The middle part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 to 8, commonly with mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  The particle-size control section averages more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand, or less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand..\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8, commonly with mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, commonly with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, white, gray, or red. In some pedons, the C horizon is coarsely mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray.  The C horizon is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silty clay loam saprolite of fine-grained metavolcanic rock."

Appling, Cecil, Hulett, Pacolet, and Wedowee  soils have less than 30 percent silt in the control section.  Aragon soils have Bt horizons that are mottled in the upper part.  Aragon and Nectar soils formed in weathered limestone, sandstone, shale, or siltstone.  Chestatee soils have more than 15 percent by volume of coarse fragments throughout.  Darley soils contain layers of fractured ironstone in the B horizon.  Herndon soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or yellower.  Nanford and Tarrus soils have a depth to weathered bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Spotsylvania soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Mahan soils formed in coastal plain sediments and have coarse fragments of ironstone."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Georgeville soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep Piedmont uplands.  Slopes are generally 6 to 15 percent but range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained metavolcanic rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 60 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F, and the frost-free season ranges from 190 to 240 days."
