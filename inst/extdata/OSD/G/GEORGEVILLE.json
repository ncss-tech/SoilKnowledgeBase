Soil horizon depths were updated 10-04-2021 as there was a 1 inch Oe horizon that didn't begin at the soil surface.\nThe September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular. The type location was also moved from Lancaster County, South Carolina to Montgomery County, North Carolina which represents the dominant area as mapped.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 13 centimeters (5 inches) (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 107 centimeters (5 to 42 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nSIR = SC0014, SC0124 (ROCKY)"
