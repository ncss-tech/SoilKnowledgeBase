    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the three months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The control section is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and averages 23 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  The AB horizon has few or common, faint to prominent mottles that have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist or dry, and chroma of 6 to 8 dry.  This horizon is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has few to many, faint to prominent mottles that have hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 8 moist or dry.  Some mottles with a chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface.  It ranges from loam through silty clay loam in the upper part to clay in the lower part."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Galvin soils occur at elevations of 30 to 1,000 feet and are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Galvin soils formed in alluvium weathered from shale, sandstone, and volcanic material.  Galvin soils occur in a humid marine climate with 40 to 70 inches average annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
