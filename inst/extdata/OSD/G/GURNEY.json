Bookcliff soils have hard bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Bullflat, Dooley, Empedrade, Fairfield, Farnuf, Felor, Greenway, Hangdo, Livona, Martinsdale, Trag, Vida, Wemple, Williams, and Yegen do not have bedrock within a depth of 60 inches. In addition, Dooley soils contain more sand and formed in glacial till; Fairfield soils have carbonates within 10 inches of the surface;  Felor soils contain more sand; Hangdo soils have carbonates below depths of 40 inches; Trag soils do not have carbonates; Vida and Williams formed in glacial till and Legen soils contain more sand.  Lefor, Lininger, and Reeder soils have soft bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Moen soils do not have carbonates and overlie granite.  Watrous soils have yellower hue in the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in residuum or colluvial sediments weathered from sedimentary rock.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."
