  "OVERVIEW": "The Gradco series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on foothills, mountains, and ridges.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from tuff.  They have slopes of 15 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
