  "OVERVIEW": "The Gird series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
