  "OVERVIEW": "The Grindstone series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till.  Grindstone soils formed in loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
