  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodsprings series consists of shallow. well drained soils overlying a lime-cemented hardpan. They formed in mixed alluvium primarily from limestone and sandstone on erosional fan remnants and alluvial flats.  Permeability is moderate above the hardpan. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
