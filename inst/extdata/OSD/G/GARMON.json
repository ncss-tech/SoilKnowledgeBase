    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.  Shale, siltstone, or limestone channers or flags from less than 1 inch to 15 inches across range from 2 to 45 percent in individual horizons and the weighted average in the control section is 10 to 35 percent.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some A horizons have value of 3 or less, and are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is a silt loam or loam.\nThe BA or AB, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is a silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC or C horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe R horizon is interbedded shale, siltstone, and limestone."
