  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 60 to 120 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly gravel sized subrounded fragments of sandstone and shale, range up to 10 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Some pedons have a loess mantle up to 16 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 4 or 5 moist (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has value of 3. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid except in cultivated pedons that range to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon up to 8 inches thick. It is silt loam or loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 6, and mottles of high or low chroma. It commonly is loam or clay loam but the range includes silt loam and silty clay loam with considerable sand. It is extremely acid to strongly acid. Some pedons that have a silty mantle up to 16 inches thick have 2B and 2C horizons.\nPedons that have a high amount of degradation just above the fragipan have B/E, BE, or E' horizons.\nThe Btx horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6, and mottles of high or low chroma. Faces of peds have chroma of 2 or less. The\nBtx and BC horizons commonly are loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam or silty clay loam that have a considerable amount of sand; and in the lower part of the Bx and in the BC horizon, gravelly analogues of these textures. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the BTx horizon and increases with increasing depth to medium acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part of the BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has similar color range as the Btx and BC horizons. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or channery analogues. It is medium acid to mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abbottstown, Ravenna, and Venango series in the same family and the Avonburg, Frenchtown, Platea, and Wadsworth series. Abbottstown soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the solum. Ravenna soils typically have sola less than 60 inches thick. Venango soils lack a Bt horizon above the fragipan. Avonburg, Platea, and Wadsworth soils are fine-silty. In addition, Platea soils do not have a Bt horizon above the fragipan and Wadsworth soils have solum thickness of less than 60 inches. Frenchtown soils have matrix colors with chroma of 2 or less dominant above the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gresham soils are on till plains on moraines. The slope gradient commonly is 1 to 6 percent, but the range is 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in weathered glacial till of Illinoian Age and have a low lime content. The till is high in fragments of sandstone and shale. A silty mantle up to 16 inches thick is on some areas. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperture ranges from about 49 to 52 degrees F."

Dekalb, Gilpin and Loudonville soils have bedrock between a depth of 20 and 40 inches and are on nearby steeper slopes. The well drained Hanover soils and moderately well drained Titusville soils are in a toposequence with Gresham soils. They are on higher topographic positions or on steeper slopes."

Gresham was not recorrelated in the update of Columbiana County, OH in 2005. Gresham remains an active series since it is used in 3 other counties in OH and PA. The last true update of the series was 6/84.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
