  "OVERVIEW": "The Gresham series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in weathered Illinoian glacial till and in a thin mantle of loess in some areas. These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 60 to 120 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly gravel sized subrounded fragments of sandstone and shale, range up to 10 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Some pedons have a loess mantle up to 16 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 4 or 5 moist (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has value of 3. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid except in cultivated pedons that range to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon up to 8 inches thick. It is silt loam or loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 6, and mottles of high or low chroma. It commonly is loam or clay loam but the range includes silt loam and silty clay loam with considerable sand. It is extremely acid to strongly acid. Some pedons that have a silty mantle up to 16 inches thick have 2B and 2C horizons.\nPedons that have a high amount of degradation just above the fragipan have B/E, BE, or E' horizons.\nThe Btx horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6, and mottles of high or low chroma. Faces of peds have chroma of 2 or less. The\nBtx and BC horizons commonly are loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam or silty clay loam that have a considerable amount of sand; and in the lower part of the Bx and in the BC horizon, gravelly analogues of these textures. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the BTx horizon and increases with increasing depth to medium acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part of the BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has similar color range as the Btx and BC horizons. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or channery analogues. It is medium acid to mildly alkaline."

Abbottstown soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the solum. Ravenna soils typically have sola less than 60 inches thick. Venango soils lack a Bt horizon above the fragipan. Avonburg, Platea, and Wadsworth soils are fine-silty. In addition, Platea soils do not have a Bt horizon above the fragipan and Wadsworth soils have solum thickness of less than 60 inches. Frenchtown soils have matrix colors with chroma of 2 or less dominant above the fragipan."
