  "OVERVIEW": "The Garley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Garley soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
