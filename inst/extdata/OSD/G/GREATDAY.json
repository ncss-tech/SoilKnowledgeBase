  "OVERVIEW": "The Greatday series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff. Greatday soils are on basin-floor remnants. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
