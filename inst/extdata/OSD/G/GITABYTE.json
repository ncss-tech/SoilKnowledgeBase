Grinrod soils have subhorizons in the particle-size control section which are dominated by cobbles and may have up to 85 percent rock fragments.  Ister soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 46 cm thick.  Searles soils have subhorizons in the particle-size control section which may have up to 80 percent rock fragments and have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 46 cm thick.  Tristan soils are deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gitabyte soils are on hills, mountains, and ridges.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff and rhyolite.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 1,495 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
