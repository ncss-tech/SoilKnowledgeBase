    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gemelo soils are on fan aprons at the base of scarps.  These soils formed in gravelly alluvium derived mainly from tuff of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring during July through September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 210 to 260 days. Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Reduff, Scotal, and Straddlebug soils.  Reduff and Scotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are shallow to tuffaceous bedrock.  These soils are on erosional hills and mountains in higher landscapes.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on alluvial fan remnants lower in the landscape."

These soils receive fast-moving overland water flow originating from adjacent hills, mountains, and scarps."
