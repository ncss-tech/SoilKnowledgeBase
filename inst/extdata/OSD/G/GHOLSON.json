Similar soils are the Bastrop, Bastsil, Cobb, Duffau, Grandfield, Grandmore, Konawa, and Silawa series.  Davilla soils have an argillic horizon with hue yellower than 7.5YR.  Lavender and Personville soils have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  May soils have mollic colored surface layers and have hue of 7.5YR and yellower in the Bt horizons.  Bastrop, Bastsil and Duffau soils have a clay distribution that does not decrease from the maximum by more than 20 percent of the maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  Bastrop soils also have mixed mineralogy.  Cobb soils have mixed mineralogy and have developed in sandstone.  Grandfield and Grandmore soils have mixed mineralogy and are in slightly drier climates.  Konawa and Silawa soils have argillic horizons with base saturation of less than 75 percent throughout."
