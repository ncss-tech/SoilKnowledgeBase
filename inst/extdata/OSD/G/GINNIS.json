    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact range from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 14 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches or to weathered bedrock for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 10 to 35 percent by weighted average, but individual subhorizons contain up to 45 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 oe 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky and granular structure.  Some pedons have a cobbly or stony surface horizon with 15 to 20 percent cobbles or 0.1 to 3 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, cobbly sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Pebbles range from 10 to 30 percent cobbles from 0 to 25 percent.\nSome pedons have a C horizon up to 16 inches thick.  It has a value of or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and is 5 to 30 percent pebbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ginnis soils are on footslopes, backslopes, and shoulders of hills and uplands at elevations of 1,000 to 3,200 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granodiorite and quartz monzonite.  They occur in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F, average July temperature is about 70 degrees, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 165 days."
