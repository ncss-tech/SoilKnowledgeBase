    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from 9 to 80 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, Btg5, Btg6); 3) Redoximorphic features: from 0 to 80 inches (Ap, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, Btg5, Btg6).\nAfter investigating this soil throughout the region in southern Indiana, and in consultation with Ohio and West Virginia, the classification of this series is changed from a Typic Fragiaqualf to a Typic Endoaqualf. The Type Location for this series was moved to Spencer County in 1995 to a more representative site within the MLRA.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on pedon numbers S91-IN123-104 and S96-IN147-001 are at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
