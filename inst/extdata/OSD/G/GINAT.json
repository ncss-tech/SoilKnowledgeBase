  "OVERVIEW": "The Ginat series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. They formed in silty alluvium over silty, loamy and clayey slackwater alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

The Type Location for this series was moved to Spencer County in 1995 to a more representative site within the MLRA."
