Shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone fragments in individual horizons range from 10 to 60 percent in the solum and from 50 to 90 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Croom, Elliber, Hartleton, Irondale, Lew, Mertz, Pattensburg, and Weaverton series in the same family.  Calvin, Lehew, Penn and Ungers are related series in other families.  Croom and Lew soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick.  Elliber, Hartleton, and Irondale soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Mertz soils contain chert fragments.  Pattensburg soils have rock fragments of quartz and sandstone.  Weaverton soils are more than 40 inches to soft weathered quartz muscovite schist.  Calvin and Lehew soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Penn and Ungers soils are fine-loamy and average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in residuum of weathered red acid shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F."
