  "REVDATE": "02/2001",
  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Gainesboro series are moderately deep and well drained.  They formed in residuum that weathered from acid red shale, fine- grained sandstone, and siltstone.  They are on uplands in the northern Piedmont and northern Appalachian Mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Calvin, Lehew, Penn and Ungers are related series in other families.  Croom and Lew soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick.  Elliber, Hartleton, and Irondale soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Mertz soils contain chert fragments.  Pattensburg soils have rock fragments of quartz and sandstone.  Weaverton soils are more than 40 inches to soft weathered quartz muscovite schist.  Calvin and Lehew soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Penn and Ungers soils are fine-loamy and average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the solum."
