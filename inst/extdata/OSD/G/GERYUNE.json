  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped Saybrook in Boone County and Dana and Sidell in McHenry County. Through MLRA update activities these areas were determined to have a clay content in the lower part of the series control section averaging 15 to 20 percent. Also Geryune soils have a bulk density of less than 1.70 g/cm3 in the lower part of the series control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap and AB horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 109 cm (14 to 43 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 71 cm (28 inches) - the contact between the Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons; udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
