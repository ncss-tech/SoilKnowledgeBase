  "OVERVIEW": "The Garceno series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on interfluves.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in).",
