  "OVERVIEW": "The Greyback series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively or excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium. Greyback soils are on alluvial fans and high terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick and depth to calcareous material is 5 to 16 inches. Depth to the skeletal material is 0 to 26 inches. The mollic epipedon has .7 to about 3 percent organic carbon which decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The control section averages loam or sandy loam and usually becomes coarser with increasing depth. It averages less than 18 percent clay.  The control section has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles. Mean annual soil temperature is 32 to 46 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is usually granular but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is typically subangular blocky but has weak prismatic structure in some pedons. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. It contains about 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Antrobus, Farlow, and Tiban soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Grafen soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Middlehill, Parachute, Supervisor and Surdal soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Midlight soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Maurice, Sebud, Sup, Thornburgh, and Tineman soils are noncalcareous throughout. Handran and Teemat soils lack  cambic horizons."

These soils formed in thick, very gravelly, calcareous alluvial parent material within a depth of 40 inches. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation occurring during each month. The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 60 days."
