  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 23 centimeters. The content of rock fragments, dominantly limestone with lesser amounts of calcareous sandstone, ranges from 3 to 20 percent by volume. The soil ranges from medium acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is dominantly silt loam, but ranges through loam and fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Some pedons have few, faint high chroma mottles. It is dominantly silt loam, but ranges through loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe bedrock is dominantly gray limestone which in some pedons, contains thin shale layers or it may be calcareous sandstone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in this family.\nBenson, Farmington, Quetico, and St. Ignace soils are in related families. Benson and Farmington soils are 25 to 50 centimeters deep, contain cambic horizons and, in addition, Benson soils are skeletal. Quetico soils are acid and frigid. St. Ignace soils are calcareous and frigid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Galoo soils are on smooth bedrock controlled landforms that contain both short steep bedrock escarpments and level areas of exposed bedrock. The slope gradient commonly is 0 through 4 percent, but the range is 0 through 8 percent. The soil formed in a thin layer of till that overlies limestone or calcareous sandstone that is typically level bedded with the limestone containing numerous solution channels. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 113 centimeters, mean annual air temperature from 8 to 12 degrees C., and mean growing season from 120 through 180 days."

Amenis, Grenville, Hogansburg, and Nellis soils are associated on deep till. Galway soils are associated where the till is 50 to 100 centimeters deep to bedrock."
