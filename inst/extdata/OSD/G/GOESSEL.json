(Bss horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2C horizon.\nGilgai features have been observed in areas of Goessel soils in native pasture.\nKeys to Taxonomy: Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nUpdated the classification, competing series and placed in semitab format.  LRM 03/01\nJLG 1/2012 Updated to meet MO 5 Soil Technical Note-1 (Revision 3);\nConversion from English to metric; added the following: longitude and latitude and clay and sand percents to typical pedon, particle-size control section, sand and clay ranges in characteristics, elevation, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Land Resource Region, Major Land Resource Area, Taxonomic Version, precipitation pattern, a couple of diagnostic features, soil moisture, and additional data; divided out upper and lower AC horizons based on lab data for typical pedon.\nDJK 05/2014 Revisited and redescribed the type location with new horizonation (Bss, BC, 2C). Updated RIC for new horizonation including redox, EC, gypsum, rock fragments in 2C, and reaction. Changed classification to Udic Haplusterts. Updated competing series for new classification. Changed parent material to clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium.  Changed landform to paleoterrace on river valley based on visiting type location and examining maps and data of area Goessel is mapped. Edited climate data. Added saturation statement to Drainage and Ksat section. Edited diagnostic horizons and features in remarks section for new description. Added gilgai statement. Added KSSL data to additional data section.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData from typical pedon is from Kansas State University Characterization Laboratory, Manhattan, Kansas; pedon ID 77KS113001. KSSL data available for pedons 59KS015001 and 59KS015002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
