  "OVERVIEW": "The Goessel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium.  Goessel soils are on paleoterraces on river valleys in Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (32 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",
