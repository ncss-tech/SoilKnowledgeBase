  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guayacan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans, ridge tops and side slopes of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.",
