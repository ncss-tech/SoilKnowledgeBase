  "OVERVIEW": "The Graham series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium from basic igneous rock.  Graham soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
