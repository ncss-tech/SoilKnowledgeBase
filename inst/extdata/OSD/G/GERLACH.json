  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerlach series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Gerlach soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
