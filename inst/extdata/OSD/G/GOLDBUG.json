  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldbug series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Goldbug soils are on mountain slopes and hillslopes, and sideslopes of valleys and mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 508 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
