  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches, and is the same as the range in depth to bedrock.  Some pedons have a thin A2 horizon up to 3 inches thick.  Soft shale and siltstone fragments range from 10 to 45 percent, and increase with increasing depth to the soft bedrock.  In some pedons, lime occurs in fractures in the bedrock.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam, clay or silty clay loam, ranging from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Soft shale and siltstone fragments range from 10 to 30 percent.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe B3 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam, clay or silty clay loam, averaging 30 to 45 percent clay.  Soft shale and siltstone fragments range from 20 to 45 percent.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Goemmer soils are on mountain side slopes, commonly below igneous dikes, at elevations of 7,400 to 8,300 feet.  They formed in fine textured residuum from weathered interbedded siltstone and shale.  The slope range is 20 to 50 percent.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil is noncalcareous and formed from noncalcareous parent rocks.  Taxonomy uses lime carbonate as its intent to classify to the subgroup level, which places this soil in a Udic subgroup.  This soil has a Ustic moisture regime.  This soil is classified apart from the Taxonomy as a Typic Ustochrept.  Last updated by the state 2/80.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
