  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gishton series consists of deep or very deep well drained soils on surface-mined areas. The soils have been reclaimed with 122 centimeters (48 inches) or more of pre-mined soils which were excavated prior to surface mine operations and later reconstructed over unconsolidated regolith from surface mining for coal. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1219 millimeters (48 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The particle-size control section ranges from 0 to about 10 percent by volume coarse fragments. In some pedons, soil fragments and isolated peds of relict genetic horizons of pre-mined soils are randomly distributed throughout and are disordered relative to any plane in the profile. Some of the soils fragments have identifiable properties such as redoximorphic features, clay films, or coatings that are characteristic of their previous formation. The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth in most pedons because of mixing or layering and from of the presence of coal or other carbonaceous material. Abrupt boundaries between soil layers are common and the compact layers or contrasting materials contribute to the restricted movement of roots and water. The depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.\nAp or A horizon:\nHue: 10YR and less commonly 7.5YR, 2.5YR and 5YR\nValue: 4 or 5 and less commonly 4 to 6\nChroma: 2 to 4 and less commonly 1 to 8\nTexture: silt loam or silty clay loam\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\nC horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5YR, and 5Y\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam\nReaction: very strongly acid or strongly acid\nRock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent by volume of channers of sandstone, siltstone, and shale\n2C horizon:\nBelow a depth of 48 inches the C horizon has a wide range of colors, and colors are variegated.\nHue: N, 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay, or their channery to extremely channery or gravelly to extremely gravelly analogs.\nReaction: ultra acid to neutral\nRock fragment content: 10 to 80 percent by volume channers of sandstone, siltstone, and shale"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gishton soils are on crests and slopes of reconstructed landscapes. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in materials that were excavated and reclaimed during surface mining operations. The upper 122 centimeters (48 inches) of the regolith dominantly is fine-earth material that consists of a mixture of the subsoil and substratum layers of pre-mined soils. Most areas have been covered with the surface layer of pre-mined soils. At depths usually greater than 122 centimeters (48 inches), the regolith is typically fine-earth material and fragments of bedrock. It is dominated by loamy material consisting of a mixture of residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone, sandstone, shale, or limestone. Mean annual precipitation is 112 to 122 centimeters (44 to 48 inches), and mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F.), frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 360 to 700 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Swanwick soils are non-acid. Farmerstown soils are fine-loamy and are shallower to unconsolidated regolith. Bethesda, Fairpoint, Morristown, and Tapawingo soils contain more rock fragments throughout and typically are on steeper side slopes on mostly unreclaimed areas nearby. The moderately well drained, very deep Apalona, Ava, Deuchars, Grantsburg and Hosmer, soils and deep Zanesville soils have argillic horizons and Apalona, Ava, Grantsburg, Hosmer, and Zanesville soils also have fragipans and are on convex summits and side slopes. The deep, well drained, Wellston soils formed in silty material over sandstone, shale, or siltstone and are on shoulders and side slopes. The moderately deep, well drained Frondorf and Gilpin soils and the somewhat excessively drained Tipsaw soils are on steeper sideslopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. The Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity is moderately high in the surface layer, moderately high to low in the stratified materials to a depth of about 122 centimeters (48 inches), and is low in the lower part of the substratum. Some areas of these soils, especially with nearly level slope gradients, develop wet spots as a result of differential settlement of the disturbed material. Water perches at various levels within the soil on the compressed layers, but primarily on the discontinuity at a depth of about 122 centimeters (48 inches)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Swanwick, Farmerstown, mine spoils, strip mines, orthents, udorthents or other miscellaneous categories in previous soil surveys. These soils will have a succession of compressed layers of traffic pans in the C horizons that formed during placement and grading of the soil material when rubber tired pans were used. Soils that were reclaimed by the truck and dozer method do not have the compressed layers caused by rubber tired scrapers, but will have some reduced permeability. Some of the individual layers have high bulk density and low available water capacity.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon the zone from the surface of the soils to a depth of approximately 9 centimeters (4 inches) (Ap horizon)."
