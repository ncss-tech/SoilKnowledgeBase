  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The content of coarse fragments, mostly shale and sandstone fragments, is less than 5 percent, commonly about 1 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3 ( 4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon, 2 to 8 inches thick, where present; has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (6 to 8 dry), and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Ap, A, and E horizons are silt loam or silty clay loam.  They are strongly acid or very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe E/B is unmottled.  The E zones have chroma of 3 or 4, and the Bt zones have chroma of 4 or 6.  Some pedons have a B/E or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6, and few to many mottles except in the upper 6 to 8 inches in some pedons.  Coatings on faces of peds have value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bt is silty clay or clay with thin subhorizons of silty clay loam in some pedons.  Average clay content is 45 to 60 percent. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part and medium acid or mildly alkaline in the lower part.\nSome pedons have BC horizons.\nThe C horizon is clay or silty clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent."

Cardington, Ellsworth, Pert, and Shinrock soils average less than 45 percent clay.  Glynwood soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 20 percent and contain less than 40 percent clay in the C horizon.  Loudon soils have a high content of shale in the lower part of the solum.  Wyatt soils have a thicker solum and are stratified in the C horizon.  Broughton soils are very fine.  Caneadea, Mahoning, and Remsen soils are Aqualfs.  Celina soils have mixed clay mineralogy. Lucas, Morley, and St. Clair soils are Udalfs."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Geeburg soils are on glacial moraines, till plains, and dissected terraces that have a plane or convex surface.  The slope gradient typically is 2 to 18 percent but the range is 2 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in clayey glacial till or lacustrine sediments derived principally from acid shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 34 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 53 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The moderately well drained Geeburg soils are in a toposequence with the Remsen and Trumbull soils.  Remsen soils are somewhat poorly drained and commonly are on lower positions on the landscape than Geeburg soils.  Trumbull soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level areas or in depressions.  Soils on nearby landscapes include the competing Caneadea soils and Glenford soils that mainly formed in lacustrine sediments.  Glenford soils are in the fine-silty family."
