These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  The control section contains less than 20 percent apparent clay.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10 YR or 7.5YR moist and 10YR or 2.5Y dry, values of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.  Some pedons have an A2 horizon.\nThe B horizon has hues of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or fine sandy loam and has weak to strong blocky structure.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, or silt loam or is stratified silt loam to sand.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid."

Cathcart soils have 15 to 35 percent soft sandstone fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Cathlamet soils are dry for 45 to 60 days.  Chelan soils contain 5 to 30 percent pumice in the control section.  Chuckanut, Squalicum, and Sulsavar soils have 15 to 35 percent hard rock fragments in the control section.  Nevat soils have an ash mantle 7 to 13 inches thick and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Pastik soils have grayish mottles in the lower part of the control section.  Pronto soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 58 degrees F.  Sadie and Sehome soils have a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 20 to 40 inches."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial outwash.  The climate is marine and characterized by cool, dry summers, and mild, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 170 to 200 days."
