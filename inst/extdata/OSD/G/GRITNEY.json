Annemaine soils are on stream terraces and have about 3 meg/100 gm. of Ca and Mg content in the Bt horizon.  Benson, Craven, Nevarc, Peawick, and Wolftever soils contain 30 percent silt or higher in the Bt horizon.  In addition, Nevarc soils are commonly on steep slopes and are non-arable.  Cid, Sheva, Rosenwall, and Vinita have paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Creedmoor soils have higher coefficient of linear extensibility and more exchangeable aluminum in the lower Bt horizon.  Dogue, Eulonia, and Nemours soils have an apparent water table.  Helena and Lignum soils have C horizons formed in saprolite with rock structure.  Newco soils do not have a seasonal high water table within 60 inches of the surface.  Sacul soils have a high shrink-swell potential in the argillic horizon.  Stapp soils have paralithic contact within 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gritney soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of the Coastal Plain uplands, usually above an elevation of 20 feet.  Slopes commonly are 2 to 10 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils have formed in fine-textured Coastal Plain sediments.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F. near the type location."

These soils are on nearby landscapes.  Bonneau and Wagram soils are on slightly higher areas and have arenic surface.  Carnegie, Dothan and Fuquay soils are on higher areas and they contain over 5 percent nodules of plinthite and have thick sola.  In addition, Fuquay soils are arenic.  Cowarts soils are on similar topographic positions as Gritney soils but they have a fine loamy control section.  Goldsboro, Norfolk and Orangeburg soils may be on slightly higher or lower smoother areas and have thick, fine-loamy control sections.  Caroline, Duplin, Faceville and Marlboro soils are commonly on higher, smoother areas and they have a thick, clayey sola."

(2) The classification of this series was changed with the 12/86 revision - from clayey, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludults to clayey, mixed, thermic Aquic Hapludults.  This is based on selected water table studies.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (a and BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 49 inches (Bt horizon).\nAquic conditions - periodic saturation and iron depletions in the zone from 17 to 70 inches (Bt2, Bt3, BC and C horizons)\nCharacterization analysis for typical pedon (S85NC-131-1) was completed by NCSU.\nADDITIONAL DATA: MLRAs: 133A, 153A\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0201 GRITNEY     0- 15   59- 68  200-250  45- 55    20- 350\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0201 NONE          1.5-3.0  PERCHED  DEC-APR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0201  0- 9  LS LFS                  0-  0  85-100  5-10   1-  4\nNC0201  0- 9  SL FSL L                0-  0  80-100 10-25   2-  7\nNC0201  0- 9  SCL CL                  0-  0  80-100 20-35   4-  8\nNC0201  9-58  C SC CL                 0-  0  90-100 35-60   7- 13\nNC0201 58-70  SR LS SCL               0-  2  55-100 10-35   2-  8\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
