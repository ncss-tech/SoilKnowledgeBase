The classification of this series was changed with the 12/86 revision from clayey, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludults to clayey, mixed, thermic Aquic Hapludults. This is based on selected water table studies. The November 2025 revision moved the type location from Northampton County, North Carolina to Halifax County, North Carolina to a more representative site.  No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0-6 inches) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 107 centimeters (6 to 42 inches) (Bt horizons)\nAquic conditions--periodic saturation and iron depletions in the zone from 69 to 152 centimeters (27 to 60 inches) (Bt3, BC, and C horizons)"
