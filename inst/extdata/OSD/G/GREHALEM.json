  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grehalem series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks. Grehalem soils are on floodplains with slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 115 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section is dominantly silty clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay. Thin sand to clay lenses occur throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y dry, value of 3 or 4 moist 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. It is loam or silt loam. It is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y dry, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam but is stratified with thin lenses of sand, loamy sand, sandy loam and very fine sandy loam.  It is weak to moderate subangular blocky structure or is massive. Some thin strata are single grained."

The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured alluvial deposits derived from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks. These soils occur in cool, coastal areas where the average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 160 inches. Mean January temperature is 39 degrees F., mean July temperature is 60 degrees F., average annual temperature is 50 degrees F., and the growing season (28 degrees F.) is between 180 and 220 days."
