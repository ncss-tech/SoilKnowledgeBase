    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of materials 1 and 2 ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper one-sixth to one-third of the series control section averages 20 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Free carbonates are at depths of 60 inches or more.  The upper part of the solum (E, Bw and E' horizons) has 0 to 2 percent rock fragments, the upper part (2Bt1 horizon) of the argillic horizon has 3 to 10 percent rock fragments and the lower part (3Bt2 horizon) of the argillic horizon and the substratum has rock fragments ranging from 0 to 25 percent by volume with 2mm to 3 inch size and having 0 to 10 percent by volume with 3 inch to 10 inch size.  The solum is slightly acid to strongly acid and the substratum is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe O horizon is comprised of accumulated remains of deciduous tree leaves, conifer tree needles, and forest floor flora.  It is Oa, Oe, or Oi.  The hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value is 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon 0 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The dry value, after mixing to 7 inches, is 6 or more.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3.  The A horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is at least one unit of chroma higher than the overlying E horizon.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. There are many or common vesicular pores.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe glossic horizon has an E/B, 2E/B or 2B/E horizon or a combination of these horizons in all pedons.  They consist of E material surrounding isolated remnants of Bt material or tongues of E material penetrating Bt material or both.  The Bt and E parts each occupy 15 percent to 85 percent of the matrix.  Colors and textures are similar to E and Bt horzions respectively.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  A few pedons have an upper subhorizon that is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. There are faint or distinct clay films on the faces of peds.  The clay averages between 8 and 18 percent.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma or 3 or 4.  It is loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or gravelly sandy loam.  It has distinct or prominent clay bridging of sand grains and in some pedson faint or distinct clay films on the faces of peds.  The clay averages between 2 and 10 percent.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon  has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The fine earth fraction typically is sand, coarse sand, or gravelly analogues.  A few pedons have thin strata of fine sand or loamy fine sand.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Automba, Itasca, Millersburg and Pemene series in the same family all of which formed in till.  The Automba soil has a hue of 5YR or redder and a bulk density greater than 1.8 gm/cc in the C horizon.  The Itasca soil has greater than 8 percent clay in the lower one-third of the series control section and below.  The Millersburg and Pemene soils have greater than 50 percent of fine sand or coarser in the upper sequum.  In addition, all of these soils do not have sand or gravel in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goodland soils are on plane and convex surfaces on glacial moraines.  They formed in a silty mantle over loamy sediments and underlying sandy sediments.  Slopes are complex and range from 1 percent to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1600 feet."

They formed in silty mantled sandy loam glacial till.  The Cromwell soils in same setting have a loamy mantle less than 20 inches thick.  The very poorly drained Lupton and Mooselake soils formed in organic materials in depressional areas."
