(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)\nA--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; loose, friable; many fine roots; many very fine fragments of shale; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Colors throughout the soil are inherited from the shale.  The horizons overlying the bedded shales typically average 50 to 65 percent clay but ranges from 35 to 65 percent clay.  The low clay percentage is due to sand-size shale fragments.  Consistence ranges from loose to hard when dry but is friable when moist.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It typically is clay but is clay loam in some pedons.  It has weathered fragments of shale that make up 5 to 35 percent by volume.  The A horizon contains less than 1 percent more organic matter than the C.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Weathered fragments of shale make up 20 to over 50 percent by volume of the C horizon.\nThe fissile shale is very hard and brittle and will not disperse in water or in sodium hexametaphosphate."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in the same family.  Other competing soils are the Dupree, Lismas, and Samsil series.  Dupree soils are more moist and have firm to extremely firm consistence.  Lismas soils are more alkaline and have a firmer consistence.  Samsil soils contain carbonates and are alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soil formed in clayey residuum weathered from acid shales.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 18 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Broadhurst, Graner, and Demar soils.  All of these associated soils are deeper to bedded shale.  The Broadhurst and Demar soils are on adjacent, nearly level to gently sloping fans and terraces.  In addition, Demar soils have argillic horizons.  Graner soils are on nearby undulating to rolling uplands.  Grummit soils are also associated with rock outcrop."
