The average annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages from 35 to 55 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Some pedons lack an Oa horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3, moist or dry.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 moist or dry.  The upper 3 inches has value and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Coarse fragments range from 20 to 50 percent by volume.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Some pedons have weak thin platy structure.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 moist or dry.  Textures are loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume.

Colton, Guardlake, Hermon, Masardis, Sheepscot, Stetson, Teneriffe, and Waiska soils have a udic moisture regime.  Etach soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till.  Hermon, Limking, Sheepscot, and Skykomish soils are sandy loam in the fine earth fraction of the E and Bs horizons.  Marblemount soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Teneriffe soils also are not stratified and have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick."
