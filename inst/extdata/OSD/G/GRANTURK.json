(A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon: The zone from 3 to 8 inches (E horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 19 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nLithic contact:  hard sandstone bedrock at 19 inches.\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 10 to 19 inches.  (Part of the Bw1 and the Bw2 horizons)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nIn some pedons, although color of the Bw horizons meets the criteria of spodic materials, it is presumed this horizon would not meet the organic carbon and oxalate extractable Al and Fe criteria.\nThe 8/2002 revision changes the mineralogy from mixed to isotic. The isotic class is predicted from the low base status of this soil, the estimated high content of iron and aluminum oxides, and from the cold and moist soil climate.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
