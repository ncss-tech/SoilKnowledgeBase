  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section for 80 to 100 consecutive days during the 4 month period following the summer solstice. Depth to the lithic contact and thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent in the solum. The solum has more than 40 percent by weight of serpentine minerals.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon ranges narrowly around 3 moist and 5 dry and has chroma of 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It is loam and has 10 to 18 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grell soils are on hills. The elevation is 3,000 to 5,000 feet. Slopes range from 7 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered mainly from serpentine and other ultramafic rocks. The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 13 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The frost free season is 90 to 120 days."
