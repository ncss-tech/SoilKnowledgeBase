Birdow and Blackrock soils lack characteristics associated with wetness and are moderately or strongly calcareous.  Dagor, Goosenwat and Monroe soils lack soil characteristics associated with wetness.  Gosinta soils are dominantly loam or silt loam in the control section.  Draper, Lakeview and Shoepeg soils have a Xeric moisture regime.  Willowdale soils have horizons of lime accumulation and have 10 to 20 percent pumice sand in the control section.  Eastcan, Coit and Winn soils are calcareous throughout their profiles.  Heidtman soils have secondary carbonates at 10 to 30 inches.  Osy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."

The soils formed in relatively recent moderately fine textured alluvium of mixed origin but derived dominantly from loessial, quartzitic, and igneous materials.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 95 to 140 days."
