  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Glenwild soils are on nearly level to gently sloping natural levees on the Teche delta plain of the Mississippi River. Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in reddish silty and clayey stratified alluvium deposited in former channels along Bayou Teche and the lower parts of the Achafalaya River.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 48 to 60 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 70 degrees to 73 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 5 to 30 feet.  Frost free days range from 290 to 330."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldwin, Iberia, and Galvez series.  Baldwin soils are on mid-slope positions between the natural levee and backswamps.  Iberia soils are on backswamp positions.  These soils formed in black to gray sediments and are clayey throughout.  Galvez soils are on similar positions as the Glenwild soils and formed in more grayish sediments."

Permeability is moderately slow.  The soil has a saturated layer beginning at 24 to 40 inches deep that is perched above the clayey strata for more than 30 cumulative days during normal years."
