  "OVERVIEW": "The Gypboy series consists of very deep, well drained soils  that formed in sandy and silty eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits. Gypboy soils are on hummocks on lake plains and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
