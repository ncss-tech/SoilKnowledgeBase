    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Depth to carbonates typically is below depths of 30 inches, but ranges from 25 to greater than 80 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section and the horizons below the A horizon are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  Textures of loamy coarse sand and coarse sand with less than 30 percent coarse and very coarse sand are also allowed in these layers.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Buried horizons are below depths of 30 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or sandy loam.  Textures of loamy coarse sand and coarse sandy loam with less than 30 percent coarse and very coarse sand are allowed.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Where it is more than 16 inches thick it has distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations below a depth of 16 inches.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon up to 18 inches thick.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon up to 25 inches thick below a depth of 27 inches. Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It may have strata with textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Hues of 5Y are allowed below depths of 40 inches.  The C horizon has strata with textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hamar, Hangaard, Isan, Isanti, Medano and Venlo series.  These soils are all poor or very poorly drained.  Hamar, Hangaard, Isan, Isanti and Venlo soils have a water table at depths of less than 1.5 feet of the surface at some time during the period of March through July.  In addition, Hangaard soils contain more than 10 percent rock fragments throughout.  Medano soils have carbonates at the surface."

They formed in sandy eolian, glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 22 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 110 to 140 days.

Hamar, Fossum and Venlo soils are on lower positions of the landscape.  Ulen soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Fossum and Ulen soils have carbonates at or near the surface.  Hecla and Maddock soils are on higher positions on the landscape.  Hecla soils are moderately well drained and do not have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features in or immediately below the mollic epipedon.  Maddock soils are well drained or somewhat excessively drained and do not have redoximorphic features above depths of 40 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 22 inches (Ap, A and Bw1 horizons).  The Bw2 horizon has the color, but not the organic carbon content to be mollic; aquic suborder criteria - chroma of 2 in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and prominent redoximorphic concentrations (Bw1 horizon).\nSoils previously correlated as a somewhat poorly drained phase of the Hamar series are included in the Garborg series. These soils are considered nonhydric.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
