The Bw2 horizon has the color, but not the organic carbon content to be mollic; aquic suborder criteria - chroma of 2 in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and prominent redoximorphic concentrations (Bw1 horizon).\nSoils previously correlated as a somewhat poorly drained phase of the Hamar series are included in the Garborg series. These soils are considered nonhydric."
