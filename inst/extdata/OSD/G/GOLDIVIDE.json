  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldivide series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in dominantly granitic alluvium. The Goldivide soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, and fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
