Sonoita soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October.  Helendale soils are not calcareous above 30 inches and have argillic horizons beginning above 15 inches. Searchlight soils are calcareous throughout. Tray soils are calcareous throughout and have strongly or very strongly alkaline argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP) of 15 to 30 percent in all parts."

Elevations are 1,600 to 4,200 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."
