  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till or colluvium from mixed geological sources.  The Goldhill soils are on mountains, foothills and terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 40 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
