  "OVERVIEW": "The Gabica series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Gabica soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Bellenmine, Cropper, and Grosschat soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Celeridge, Genoa and Loope soils average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Cleavage soils have mollic epipedons that include a transitional BA horizon and do not include the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Cleavmor soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon and are slightly alkaline. Gerdog, Hawkridge, Mattier, Rozara, Shalcleav and Tweener soils have bedrock within 36 cm. Gidwin soils have mollic epipedons that include the entire argillic horizon and average 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Grandeposit and Realmcoy soils have quartzite and slate, or quartzite rock fragments and bedrock. Hutchley soils have transitional AB horizons and are neutral to slightly alkaline.  Mascamp soils have dominantly cobbles and stones in the particle-size control section and have identifiable secondary carbonates coating the lithic contact.  Melling soils have a xeric moisture regime that does not border on aridic.  Pernog soils have dominantly stones in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that include the entire argillic horizon."
