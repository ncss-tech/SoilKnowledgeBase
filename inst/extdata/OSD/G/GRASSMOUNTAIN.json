    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - from depths of 15 to 44 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nAndic feature - from 1 to 15 inches (A and AB horizons). Based on lab data and field observations.\nMedial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nParticle-size control section (fine-loamy family) - from 11 to 41 inches (1 inch of AB horizon, all of Bw1 and Bw2 horizons, and 2 inches of the BCt horizon).\nEvidence of translocated clay - few faint clay films are present in this soil; however, the clay increase is not significant enough to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nOfficial type location and pedon moved at final correlation to more accurately reflect the modal concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
