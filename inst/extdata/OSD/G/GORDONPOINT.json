  "OVERVIEW": "The Gordonpoint series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum from basalt.  These soils are on volcanic flows on mountaintops and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

The soil moisture control section is moist in some part for 70 to 85 percent of the time that the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The soil moisture regime is typic ustic.\nThe mollic epipedon is 16 to 23 inches thick. Depth to bedrock and the combined thickness of the A and B horizons is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent clay and 45 to 75 percent basalt rock fragments. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR and dry chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth is loam or clay loam with 5 to 20 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It contains 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 35 to 60 percent gravel.  It has prismatic or blocky structure."
