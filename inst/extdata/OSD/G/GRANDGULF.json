  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grandgulf soils are in nearly level to gently sloping sinkholes. They formed in fine-silty alluvium that has washed into the sinkholes from the adjacent soils. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are commonly 700 to 1,400 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lowassie, Poynor, Splitlimb, and Tonti soils. Lowassie soils are in the fine family and are on similar landscape positions. Poynor soils are in the loamy skeletal over clayey family and are on steep side slopes of the sinkholes. Splitlimb soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar landscape positions. Tonti soils have a fragipan and are on broad ridgetops."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is negligible. These soils are ponded for very brief periods after heavy rains. Permeability is moderate, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high."
