The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 85 percent of the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Typic Aridic.\nThe thickness of the solum is 9 to 19 inches . The depth to the gravel or sand ranges from 14 to 35 inches.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam to gravelly silt loam. This horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4, but dominantly 3 or 4. The Btn (natric) horizon is dominantly silty clay loam, but ranges to silty clay. Clay content averages 35 to 42 percent. This horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon ranges from extremely gravelly coarse sand to sand. This horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline."
