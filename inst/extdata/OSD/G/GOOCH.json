  "OVERVIEW": "The Gooch series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Gooch soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Texture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is loam or clay loam with a clay percent of 18 to 35 percent.\nThe An horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 and 2. Some pedons have faint to distinct mottles in the An horizon.  Textures are silt loam and silty clay loam. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 10 to 40 percent.\nThe Bkng and Ckng horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 60 percent and the exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 10 to 45 percent.\nThe 2Cng horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 moist and 6 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture ranges from very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand."
