Some pedons have faint to distinct mottles in the An horizon.  Textures are silt loam and silty clay loam. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 10 to 40 percent.\nThe Bkng and Ckng horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 60 percent and the exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 10 to 45 percent.\nThe 2Cng horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 moist and 6 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.

These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, sandstone, quartzite and gneiss.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 130 to 165 days."

Additional field work is needed to verify the depth to the seasonal high water table.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT as lab numbers U584501 to U584507.  It is unpublished data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
