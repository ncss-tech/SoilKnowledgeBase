The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff. The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer. Average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
