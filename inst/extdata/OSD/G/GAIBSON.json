  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaibson series consists of shallow, well drained soils  with moderately slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff. Gaibson soils occur on foothills and canyon sides and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
