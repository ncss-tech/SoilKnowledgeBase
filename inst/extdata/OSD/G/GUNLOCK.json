  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches but commonly less than 100 inches. Depth to horizons that have fragic characteristics ranges from 20 to 34 inches. Chert content by volume is less than 10 percent in the A and upper B horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the lower B above the 2Btx horizon and 5 to 50 percent in the 2Btx horizon, and 5 to 75 percent in the 3Bt horizon. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5. If the color value moist is less than 3.5, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick. The E horizon, if present, has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. They are strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less may be present at depths of more than 10 inches below the top of the Bt horizon. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btgx and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is very strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons have 2E horizons. Expression of the brittleness is 30 to 60 percent of the matrix. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues.\nThe 3Bt or 4Bt horizon has colors with hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay, or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues. It is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have neutral or mildly alkaline C horizons that have colors and textures similar to the 3Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These gently to strongly sloping soils are on side slopes and foot slopes of the uplands and terraces. Slopes are commonly 2 to 9 percent, but range from 1 to 35 percent. The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loess and pedisediment over residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone and cherty dolomite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cedargap, Gatewood, Moniteau, Ocie and Union series. Cedargap and Moniteau soils have less clay and are on flood plains and low terraces below the Gunlock soils. Gatewood and Ocie soils are shallower to bedrock and are higher in elevation. Union soils have fragipans and are on rounded ridgetops and side slopes above the Gunlock soils."
