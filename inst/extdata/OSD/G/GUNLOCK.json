  "OVERVIEW": "The Gunlock series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and pedisediment over residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone and cherty dolomite on uplands and terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5. If the color value moist is less than 3.5, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick. The E horizon, if present, has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. They are strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less may be present at depths of more than 10 inches below the top of the Bt horizon. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btgx and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is very strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons have 2E horizons. Expression of the brittleness is 30 to 60 percent of the matrix. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues.\nThe 3Bt or 4Bt horizon has colors with hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay, or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues.
