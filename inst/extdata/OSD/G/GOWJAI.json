Closkey, Devils and Sumine soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 50 to 100 cm.  Granipeak soils lack a Cq horizon of silica accumulation and contain 18 to 25 percent clay.  Jivas, and Torro soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control sections.  Millan are very deep and are 25 to 50 cm to the base of the Bt.  Remount soils are very deep, have a Bk horizon and contain 60 to 90 percent rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gowjai soils are on hills mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
