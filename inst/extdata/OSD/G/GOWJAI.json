  "OVERVIEW": "The Gowjai series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Gowjai soils are on hills and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
