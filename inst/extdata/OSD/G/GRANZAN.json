  "OVERVIEW": "The Granzan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shale.  Granzan soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
