They formed in\nalluvium dominantly from lacustrine siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 12\npercent.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  Average\nannual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110\nto 165 days."

Bramwell soils are fine-silty and\nsomewhat poorly drained.  Owyhee soils have cambic horizons and are 20\nto 35 inches deep to laminated lacustrine sediments.  Stanfield soils\nhave duripans and Turbyfill soils are coarse-loamy.  Baldock and\nBramwell soils occur on lower, wetter landscape positions.  The other\nassociated soils are on landscape positions similar to Garbutt soils."
