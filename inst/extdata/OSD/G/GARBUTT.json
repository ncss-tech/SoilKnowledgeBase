  "OVERVIEW": "The Garbutt series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan\nterraces, basalt plains, and alluvial fans.  They formed in loess and\nsilty alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 12\npercent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the\naverage annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Bramwell soils are fine-silty and\nsomewhat poorly drained.  Owyhee soils have cambic horizons and are 20\nto 35 inches deep to laminated lacustrine sediments.  Stanfield soils\nhave duripans and Turbyfill soils are coarse-loamy.  Baldock and\nBramwell soils occur on lower, wetter landscape positions.  The other\nassociated soils are on landscape positions similar to Garbutt soils."
