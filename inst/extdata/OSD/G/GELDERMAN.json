The soil is usually moist but is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in all parts of the soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section is 40 to 50 percent clay, and has 5 to 30 percent pararock fragments and 5 to 10 percent total rock fragments. The rock fragments are weathered basalt or tuffaceous materials. The depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A1  horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellpine, Nekia, Tullycreek (T), and Windygap soils. All of these soils have an ochric epipedon. Bellpine soils have an ochric epipedon and has rock and pararock fragments and a paralithic contact that are from sedimentary origin. Nekia soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact from igneous origin. Tullycreek soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Windygap soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact from sedimentary origin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gelderman soils occur on summit (interfluve component) and shoulder positions (nose slope component) of hills and foothills. The summit position typically has a linear-convex or convex-linear slope shape, and the shoulder position typically has a convex-convex slope shape. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevation is 250 to 2200 feet. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from the Columbia River Basalt Formation, Siletz River Volcanics, and tuffaceous materials from the Sardine Formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Cottrell soils have redox depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon and occur on concave positions. Jory soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and occur on linear or concave parts of the hillslope. MacDunn soils are clayey-skeletal. Price soils do not have an argillic horizon. MacDunn and Price soils occur on the more steeply sloping parts of the hillslope. Ritner soils are clayey-skeletal and are 20 to 40 inches to hard bedrock. Witzel soils are 12 to 20 inches to hard bedrock. Ritner and Witzel soils occur on convex parts of the hillslope."
