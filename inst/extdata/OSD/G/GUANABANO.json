Reaction ranges strongly acid to neutral in the Ap and AB horizons and from slightly acid or neutral in the B and C horizons. The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, clay or their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay, clay or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bk horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6; or is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from none in the upper part to more than 75 percent, by volume, in the lower part.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Guanabano soils are on side slopes and summits of hills on the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent. They formed in lenticular deposits of sand and gravel, mudstone and sandstone, or deposits of shale, sandy limestone and sandy conglomerate.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 21 to 52 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 77 to 81 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Callabo, Descalabrado and Llanos series.  Callabo and Descalabrado soils are on similar positions but do not have argillic horizon.   In additions, Descalabrado soils are shallow to volcanic bedrock.  Llanos soils are on adjacent lower foot slopes and terraces, are very deep, have clayey, smectitic control sections, and are Vertisols."
