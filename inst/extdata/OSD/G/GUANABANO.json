  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guanabano series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes and summits of hills of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in lenticular deposits of sand, gravel, mudstone, and sandstone or deposits of shale, sandy limestone, and sandy conglomerate.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.",
