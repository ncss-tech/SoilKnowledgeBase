  "OVERVIEW": "The Grover series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ridges and side slopes on piedmont uplands. They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in\nthe upper part on steep slopes, and is weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks high in mica such as biotite gneiss and schist. Mean annual temperature is 59\ndegrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 64 inches near the type location. Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the A and B horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, Ap, and E horizons, and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the Bt, BC, and C horizons. Content of mica flakes ranges from common to many in the A horizon and is many in the Bt, BC, and C horizons. Mica content increases with depth.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Where the value is 3 or less, it is less than 6 inches thick. The A or Ap horizon commonly is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. In eroded pedons, it is sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color to the Bt horizon, or in some pedons it may be mottled. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the BC horizon or is multicolored. It is saprolite weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks high in mica such as mica gneiss and schist. Texture is typically loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, but may include loamy sand."

All of these except Rion and Wedowee soils are in a clayey family. Only Madison and Tallapoosa soils are high in mica content. Rion soils are in a fine-loamy family, Tallapoosa soils are in a loamy, shallow family. Appling, Cecil, and Lloyd soils are on less dissected piedmont uplands. The other soils are on the same landscape\npositions as Grover soils."

The dominant understory plants include flowering dogwood, mountain laurel, American holly, sourwood, blackgum, red maple, green brier, common persimmon, eastern redbud, and sassafras. Cleared areas are principally used for growing corn, cotton, oats, grain sorghum, tobacco, pasture and hay."
