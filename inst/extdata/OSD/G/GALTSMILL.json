  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Gravel and cobble size rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil. Some pedons may range up to 80 percent in the C horizon below 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 3, value dry of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in some pedons.  Mottles in shades of gray are in some pedons below a depth of 24 inches.  The Bw horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray are in some pedons.  The C horizon is sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The C horizon in some pedons is stratified."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Galtsmill soils are on flood plains of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in recent alluvium derived from limestones, sandstones, siltstones, phyllites, shales, gneiss, granites, schists, and greenstones.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

These soils are on flood plains.  Batteau, Wehadkee and Yogaville soils have gray mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Chewacla, Riverview, Toccoa, and Wehadkee soils do not have thick dark surface layers.  Wingina soils have more clay in the subsoil."
