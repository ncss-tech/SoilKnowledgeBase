  "OVERVIEW": "The Galtsmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability on flood plains.  They formed in loamy recent alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, limestone, shale, siltstone, sandstone, phyllite, and greenstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Gravel and cobble size rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil. Some pedons may range up to 80 percent in the C horizon below 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 3, value dry of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in some pedons.  Mottles in shades of gray are in some pedons below a depth of 24 inches.  The Bw horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray are in some pedons.  The C horizon is sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The C horizon in some pedons is stratified."

Chewacla, Riverview, Toccoa, and Wehadkee soils do not have thick dark surface layers.  Wingina soils have more clay in the subsoil."
