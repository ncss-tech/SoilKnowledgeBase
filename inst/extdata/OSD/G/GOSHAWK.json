These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick, and has a estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 40 to 70 percent rock fragments, and 12 to 20 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 80 percent gravel and 5 to 30 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goshawk soils are on shoulders and upper backslopes of mountains at elevations of 3,500 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and volcanic rock, mixed with a component of glacial till, and a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F., the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F., and the average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days."
