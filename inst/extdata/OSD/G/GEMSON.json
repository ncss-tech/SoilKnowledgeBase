  "OVERVIEW": "The Gemson series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic, mesic family of Calcic Argixerolls.  Typically, Gemson soils have dark grayish brown, platy, neutral, cobbly clay loam A1 horizons that grade into dark brown, prismatic and angular blocky, neutral clay overlying horizons with accumulation of carbonates.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 45 inches to many feet.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum is 40 to 70 inches thick.  Angular gravel, cobblestones, and stones in the solum range from about 3 to 20 percent by volume and are mainly of basalt.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 65 degrees to 70 degrees F.  When not frozen, some subhorizon of the soil between depths of 10 and 40 inches is dry for 90 cumulative days or more.  The A1 horizon has value of 4 to 4.8 dry and 2 to 2.8 moist and chroma of 1.6 to 2.5.  The combined thickness of the A horizons is 6 to 14 inches.  The B2t horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, or heavy clay loam, containing 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has moderate medium to very coarse prismatic to strong medium and coarse angular blocky structure.  The argillic horizon has a clay increase of less than 20 percent total clay within a 3-inch vertical distance from its top.  The accumulation of calcium carbonate is weak to moderate.  Probably the base saturation of the argillic horizon is above 80 percent."

Durkee soils have strong prismatic B2t horizons, sola 14 to 24 inches thick and are underlain by argillite bedrock.  Flowell soils have sola 12 to 38 inches thick.  Gem and Gemid soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Also, Gemid soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Newell soils have moderately fine textured B2t horizons.  Oxford soils have 2.5Y or 5YR hue in the Bt horizon.  Reardan soils have a B&A horizon.  Ruclick soils have more than 50 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon and have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches."

Slopes are mostly between 5 and 35 percent and range from 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basaltic materials.  The climate is dry subhumid and has dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, including 3 to 5 feet of snowfall.  Average freeze-free period is 120 to 160 days."
