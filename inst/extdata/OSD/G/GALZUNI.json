  "OVERVIEW": "The Galzuni series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial materials derived from shale and sandstone. Galzuni soils are on mesas, cuestas, and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
