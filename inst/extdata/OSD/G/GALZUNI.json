Galzuni soils are on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, and footslopes of hills. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The frost free period is 100 to 135 days."

The Bryway and Evpark soils are moderately deep to shale and sandstone. The Highdye and Vessilla soils are shallow to sandstone. The Parkelei soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The Silcat soils lack an argillic horizon and have vertic properties. The Toldohn soils are shallow to shale."
