  "OVERVIEW": "The Graylock series consists of deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils on mountainsides.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from intermediate intrusive rocks.  Slopes are 20 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the average annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

Aspects are northerly at lower elevations but may be any direction at higher elevations.  Average annual precipitation is 635 to 1,000 mm and comes mostly as snow.  Average annual temperature is 0 to 6 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 20 to 70 days."
