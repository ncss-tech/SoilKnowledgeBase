Castlepeak soils have 60 to 90 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chena and Nizina soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 1 degrees C.  Mirror Lake soils have 35 to 70 percent quartzite and sandstone fragments and hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  Nataga soils lack Bw horizons.    Obscurity soils have 15 to 50 percent volcanic ash in the particle-size control section.  Ovanda soils have E horizons and lamellae.  Polepatch soils formed in material weathered from basalt and have basalt rock fragments throughout the particle-size control section.  Studebaker soils have basalt fragments and 15 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Graylock soils are on mountainsides at elevations of 1,525 to 2,595 meters.  They formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium derived from intermediate intrusive rocks.  Slopes are 20 to 80 percent.  Aspects are northerly at lower elevations but may be any direction at higher elevations.  Average annual precipitation is 635 to 1,000 mm and comes mostly as snow.  Average annual temperature is 0 to 6 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 20 to 70 days."
