Granylith soils have a xeric moisture regime and have a 3 to 6 inch saturated zone just above the lithic contact for more than 20 consecutive days during spring and early summer.  Rodell soils have a xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic. Zonite soils are very shallow."

Stecum soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock and are on similar but somewhat less erosional slope positions.  Zonite soils are very shallow. Zonite soils tend to occur on more strongly convex nose, ridge or shoulder slopes.  Basincreek soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have thin lamellae of accumulated clay in one or more E and Bt horizons.  Basincreek soils occur in more depositional footslope, swale, and headslope positions."

The native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and/or lodgepole pine with a sparse understory of Idaho fescue, elk sedge, common juniper, Oregon grape, bearberry and pinegrass.  Grouse whortleberry and pinegrass are prevalent on moister, high elevation sites."
