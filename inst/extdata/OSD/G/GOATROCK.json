  "OVERVIEW": "The Goatrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils on high elevation mountain slopes.  They formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",
