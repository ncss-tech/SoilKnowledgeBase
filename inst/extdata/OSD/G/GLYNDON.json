  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The calcic horizon begins within a depth of 16 inches.  These soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  These soils do not have rock fragments at least to a depth of 40 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent typically ranges from 15 to 40 percent in the 0- to 40-inch section.  Calcium carbonate contents higher than 40 percent are in the calcic horizon in some pedons and some pedons are saline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons have an ABk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features are present in some pedons.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Sandy clay loam and silty clay loam textures are possible because of the large amounts of clay size calcium carbonate in this horizon.  Some pedons have Bky or BCk horizons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic features are present in some to all parts.  Texture is very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  A 2C horizon of finer or coarser materials begin at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 3 percent on glacial lake plains.  They formed in 40 inches or more of late Wisconsian age glacial lacustrine sediments and delta sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1500 feet."

The poorly drained Borup soils are in shallow depressions and lower-lying flats, and have a calcic horizon within 16 inches.  Delmamere soils are in similar positions and are leached.  Eckman and Gardena soils are better drained and are on higher lying areas.  Mantador soils are in similar positions and the calcic horizon is below 16 inches.  Tiffany soils are in depressions, are poorly drained, and are leached.  Wheatville soils have clayey 2C horizons within 40 inches."

No. 122 is the typical pedon of this series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
