  "REVDATE": "12/2012",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Groveland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic rock. These soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants and valley floors in intermontane basins. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
