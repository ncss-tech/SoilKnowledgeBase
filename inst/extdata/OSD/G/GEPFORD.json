  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F. The moisture control section is moist in some part all of the time and is saturated for up to 4 months, unless drained. Average clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section is 50 to 60 percent. Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the surface horizons and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent in the surface horizon and 2 to 15 percent in the lower horizons. Carbonate is disseminated and/or segregated as concretions, threads, nodules and soft masses. Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 2 to 16 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 30 in the surface layer and 8 to 50 in the subsoil, and some part of the subsoil always is greater than 13. Reaction of the soil profile is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, typically increasing in alkalinity with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/2. Moist color is 5Y 2/1, 2.5/1, 3/1, 3/2, 4/2, 4/1, or N 5/0. Texture is clay or silty clay. Cracks, when dry, range from 1/4 to 1 inch wide and extend up to 29 inches deep in the soil. Redoximorphic features may be present in some A horizons.\nThe B horizon has color of 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4; 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3 or 8/1. Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4; 5GY 4/1, 5/1; 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3. Moist colors of redoximorphic features are 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 3/2, 3/4, 3/6, 4/4, 4/6; 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4; 5Y 2/1, 2.5/1, 4/1, 4/3, 4/4, 5/1, 5/2 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 5GY 4/1, 4/2, 5/1; 5G 5/1; N 2/0, 5/0; 5YR 3/2 or 3/3. Texture is clay loam, clay or silty clay in the upper part and may have thin strata of sand to clay in the lower part. Hard carbonate nodules are few or common. Few to common pressure faces are in the B horizons. Wedge-shaped aggregates that are tilted at least 10 degrees occur in all pedons. Some pedons have Bkyg horizons. Gypsum content is variable due to additions of gypsum as a soil amendment."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gepford soils are on flood plains, basin floors and basin rims. The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks, and influenced by lacustrine sediments. Slope is0 to 1 percent. Elevations are 120 to 250 feet. Climate is arid to semiarid and has hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation varies from 6 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 82 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F. Frost-free season varies from 220 to 275 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lethent, Pitco, Tachi and Vanguard series. Lethent soils on fan remnants have a natric horizon and an ochric epipedon. Pitco soils on basin rims and flood plains lack carbonates in any part of the profile. Tachi soils on basin floors and flood plains have a very-fine particle-size control section. Vanguard soils on flood plains have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; ponded in some areas; runoff is medium or high; very slow permeability. Sandy substratum phases occur with moderately rapid or rapid permeability in the substratum. The perched water table has been lowered to 30 to 72 inches because runoff water has been intercepted. Unless protected, the soil is flooded for 30 to 90 days from January through March once every 3 years. Many areas that are protected by upstream diversions of water (such as dams, levees and canals) are rarely flooded."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Reaction is highly variable as a result of addition of gypsum and sulfur by farmers. Where farmers have added significant amounts of gypsum or sulfur the soil reaction will be lowered. These horizons with segregated gypsum are designated with the \"y\" horizon suffix.\nThe Gepford series was initially classified as Vertic Haplaquolls.  This was changed to Typic Natraquerts when wedge-shaped aggregates weredescribed in the Gepford profiles.\nThe original competing series before taxonomy change were the Dospalos, Portageville (T), and Tulare series. Dospalos soils have 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a conductivity of less than 2 decisiemens per meter. Portageville soils lack salinity. Tulare soils have a horizon with more than 15 percent calcium carbonate and lack carbonate nodules in the B horizon. They also lack redoximorphic features in the A horizons.\nDiagnostic Features and Characteristics:\n1.0 Mollic Epipedon--The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 25 inches (Ap horizons). These layers are not designated with a \"g\" horizon subscript because it has been ripped and tilled.\n2.0 Fine Particle Size Family--The zone from a depth of 10 inches to a depth of about 40 inches has an average of 50 to 60 percent clay.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
