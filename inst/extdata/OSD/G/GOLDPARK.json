  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldpark series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived from shale with colluvial influence from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
