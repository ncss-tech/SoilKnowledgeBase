  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 51 to 102 cm. Rock fragments in the mineral material range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the soil. Reaction, in unlimed areas, ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the mineral surface and subsoil, and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. The pH in CaCl2 is less than 5.0.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium platy or blocky.\nThe B or Bg horizons are neutral or have hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky. Most pedons have common or many redoximorphic accumulations below a depth of 22 cm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam or silt loam. It has weak plate-like divisions inherited from the weathering bedrock, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm. Few to many redoximorphic features are present. Some pedons have a very firm Cd horizon with very coarse prismatic structure.\nThe 2R layer consists of hard, gray, brownish, or reddish colored sandstone, siltstone, or shale. The upper part of the bedrock is fractured in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gretor soils are on uplands of glaciated dissected plateaus and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils developed in a thin mantle of till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C; mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1270 mm; and mean annual frost-free days range from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 762 m above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Gretor soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the well drained Mongaup soils and the moderately well drained Middlebrook soils. The Middlebrook soils and the Mongaup soils are nearby associates. The shallow, somewhat excessively and well drained Hawksnest soils are closely associated on nearby convex landforms, and on slightly higher landforms. Very deep, moderately well drained Willdin soils, and somewhat poorly drained Ontusia soils are on nearby landscapes where the mantle of till is thicker over bedrock. Very deep, well drained Lewbath soils are on adjacent valley sides where the till deposits are thicker."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is the frigid equivalent of the Greene series, and the moderately deep equivalent of the Torull series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 22 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 22 to 56 cm (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\n3. Aquic moisture regime- wetness evidenced by 2 chroma matrix colors and redoximorphic accumulations in the zone from 22 to 56 cm (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\n4. Aeric subgroup - evidenced by 50 percent or more redoximorphic accumulations in the zone from 44  to 56 cm (Bg2 horizon).\n5. CEC activity class of active estimated based on other similar series in the\nUSDA-Cornell New York database for Aeric Haplaquepts (such as Greene & Almond).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial Characterization data available for pedon #87-22 from Otsego County, New York\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
