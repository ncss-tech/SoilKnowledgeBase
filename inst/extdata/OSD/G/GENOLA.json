  "OVERVIEW": "The Genola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone and shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, basin floors, fan skirts and flood-plains and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm.",
