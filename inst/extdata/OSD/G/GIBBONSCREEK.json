  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The rooting depth is greater than\n80 inches. Mining operations have mixed the materials from\nabout 30 to 150 feet deep.  The soils are mainly slightly\nacid or neutral but range from strongly acid to moderately\nalkaline and these ranges are within some pedons.  Rock\nfragments and pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent.  Lignite\nand carbonaceous shale fragments commonly less than 3 inches\nacross range from a trace to about 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and\nchroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy\nclay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Fragments or masses of\nshale and lignite range from few to many in darker and\nlighter colors.  Some pedons contain a few small fragments\nof iron pyrite.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and\nchroma of 1 to 4.  Masses or mottles with these colors as\nwell as red, yellow, brown and gray colors range from none\nto few.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay\nloam.  Some pedons contain layers, streaks, or bodies of\nsilty clay, clay, fine sandy loam or loamy sand.  The\nweighted average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control\nsection ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Fragments of\nsiltstone or sandstone range from none to 15 percent.\nContent of fragments decreases the first few years following\nmining, due to weathering.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from\n5 to 12 percent and the electrical conductivity ranges from\n1 to 4 mmhos/cm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same\nfamily. Similar series include Barge, Bigbrown, Brilliant,\nDrake, Grayrock, Kanima, and Palmerdale series.  Barge and\nKanima soils have fragments of diagnostic horizons within\nthe control section.  Bigbrown soils have fine-silty control\nsections and exchangeable sodium percentage less than 5\npercent.  Brilliant and Palmerdale soils have loamy-skeletal\ncontrol sections.  Grayrock soils have fine-silty control\nsections and are moist for longer periods in the moisture\ncontrol section.  Drake soils are calcareous throughout, are\ndry for longer periods of time and are not on mine spoil\nmaterials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gibbonscreek soils are on gently\nsloping to strongly sloping surfaces.  They are on mine\nspoil areas where draglines used in coal strip mining\noperations have mixed overburden materials.  Slope gradients\nrange from 1 to 20 percent with plane or convex surfaces.\nThe soils are being reclaimed immediately after mining\noperations and therefore slopes are gentle and fairly\nuniform over large tracts.  The mean annual temperature\nranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual\nprecipitation ranges from 32 to 44 inches, and Thornthwaite\nP-E indices range from 54 to 68.  The lignite seams are\nmainly in the Jackson Group of late Eocene Epoch.  However,\nin some areas, Quaternary age materials are part of the\noverburden and are also intermixed.  Mining operations, to\nsome degree, are mixing soil materials from the surface to a\ndepth of about 30 to 150 feet."

About 1/2 of smoothed areas are being\nestablished to pastures of coastal bermudagrass.  Other\nareas are being established to native grasses. Vegetation\nbefore mining was mid and tall grasses with post oak and\nblackjack oak trees."
