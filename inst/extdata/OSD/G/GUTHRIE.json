The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Pedons with value of 3 or less and chroma of 3 or 2 are less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Many pedons have few to many redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, and yellow.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  The horizon has few to many redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  In some pedons, the Btx horizon is an evenly mottled pattern of gray, yellow, red, and brown and does not have a dominant color. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam."
