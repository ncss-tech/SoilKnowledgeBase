  "OVERVIEW": "The Growden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from siliceous rock with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on backslope of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Sitdown soils are sandy-skeletal and have an ochric epipedon and are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains, outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Pepoon soils have a lithic contact within depth of 20 inches and are on glacially abraded mountain ridges, knolls, peaks, and saddles.  Scar soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on mountains.  Togo soils have an ochric epipedon and are on backslopes, footslopes, and ridges of mountains."
