These soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash, and colluvium from siliceous rock sources.  They are in a cold subhumid climate with a mean annual temperature of 38 degrees F., a mean annual precipitation of 20 to 30 inches, and a frost-free period of 80 to 100 days."

Buhrig soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and are on mountain ridges and knobs.  Leonardo soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on glaciated mountain slopes.  Sitdown soils are sandy-skeletal and have an ochric epipedon and are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains, outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Pepoon soils have a lithic contact within depth of 20 inches and are on glacially abraded mountain ridges, knolls, peaks, and saddles.  Scar soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on mountains.  Togo soils have an ochric epipedon and are on backslopes, footslopes, and ridges of mountains."
