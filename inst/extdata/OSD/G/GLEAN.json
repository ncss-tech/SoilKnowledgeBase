They formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks including metamorphic, basalt, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 30 to 45 days and up to 80 days in Nevada."
