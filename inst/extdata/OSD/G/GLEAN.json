  "OVERVIEW": "The Glean series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks including metamorphic rocks, basalt, rhyolite and andesite.  Glean soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
