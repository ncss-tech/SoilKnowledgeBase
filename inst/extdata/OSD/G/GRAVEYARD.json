Thought to have formed from calcium and magnesium that precipitated out during fluctuating seasonal water tables under a climate much wetter than the present.  Repeated wetting and extreme drying of the soil may have been a factor in nodule development.  The petronodes have no internal organization and break down completely in HCl acid but not in water.\nReaction: slightly or moderately alkaline\nClay content: 5 to 18 percent\nDepth to calcic horizon: 3 to 20 inches\nA horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma: 4 or 6, dry or moist\nTexture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 14 percent\nBk and Bky horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist\nTexture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent\nGypsum content: 0 to 5 percent"
