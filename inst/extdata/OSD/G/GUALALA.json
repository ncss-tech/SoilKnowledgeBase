  "OVERVIEW": "The Gualala soils are Lithosols developed on partially decomposed shale rock near the coast of northern California.  The soils are shallow but essentially nonstony and have a characteristic brush cover.  Climate is humid microthermal with cool, nearly rainless but foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 inches to about 50 inches, and mean temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Growing season averages about 240 days, but during this period the highest daily temperature is normally less than 65 degrees F.\nThis series is associated with the Noyo, Caspar and Mendocino series.  Both the Noyo and Caspar are podzolized soils, in contract to the nonpodzolized and very weakly developed Gualala soils, and both are developed from soft sandstone or sandy coastal plain material.  The Mendocino soils are distinctly deeper and characteristically timber-covered.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rather uniform in depth over considerable distance.  In some places surface color has a reddish cast.  Normally a very thin layer of litter mixed with small shale fragments occurs on the immediate surface but this may be lacking in places.  Surface texture ranges from loam to clay loam."
