    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The mean winter soil temperature varies from 34 degrees to 36 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature varies from 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  from about May 1 to December 1.  These soils are usually saturated in the late winter and spring due to a seasonal water table at a depth of 18 to 40 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is stratified clay loam or silty clay loam and loam that has a weighted average content of 27 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 35 percent sand.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 14 to 24 inches.  Below this depth, the soil meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon except that it is both massive and hard or very hard.  Depth to mottles is 0 to 21 inches.   Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.  Texture of the A1 is silt loam, fine sandy loam or mucky loam.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 2.5Y 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 2/2; 5Y 3/1 or N2/.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AC horizon is 10YR 5/3; 2.5Y 4/1 or 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 2.5/1 or 4/1.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is 5Y 5/3, 6/3 or 2.5Y 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 3/2, 4/4; 5Y 2.5/1, 3/1, 3/2 or 4/3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nGley colors of 5GY or 5G are at a depth of 38 to 60 inches.  Some pedons have buried A horizons with neutral hue or moist chroma of 1 at a depth of 40 to 55 inches.\nPonded phases are recognized that have a 6 inch mucky loam Al horizon."

In addition, the Ambraw soils have medium acid or strongly acid Bg horizons with prismatic structure, and the Sloan soils have carbonates at a depth of 22 to 60 inches and have prismatic or blocky Bg horizons.  The Ozamis soils are moderately alkaline.  The Settlemeyer soils have calcareous A horizons and are in an arid or semiarid climate with 4 to 12 inches of precipitation.  The Toppenish soils are calcareous in part of the upper 20 inches and have blocky or prismatic B horizons."
