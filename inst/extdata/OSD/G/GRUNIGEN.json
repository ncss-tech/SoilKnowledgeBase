  "OVERVIEW": "The Grunigen series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from granite. The Grunigen soils are on steep mountain slopes and canyon walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 885 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
