Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils exhibit the \"Red Edge\" effect, namely being better drained and containing less sodium than adjacent soils on the terrace tread.  The average annual precipitation near the type location is about 50 inches; the average annual temperature is 61 degrees F."

They are poorly dained and contain a natric horizon.  Hillemann soils occur on higher terraces.  Hillemann soils are somewhat poorly drained and contain a natric horizon.  Jackport and Overcup soils are on terrace treads.  Jackport soils are poorly drained and in a smectitic mineralogy family.  Overcup soils are poorly drained and in a smectitic mineralogy family.  Tuckerman soils occur along drains below escarpments.  They are poorly drained and in fine-loamy particle-size family."
