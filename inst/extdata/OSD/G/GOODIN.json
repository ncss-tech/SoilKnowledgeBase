The soil is usually moist but is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches following the summer solstice. The depth to moderately or strongly cemented siltstone or sandstone is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent paragravel. The pararock fragments are of siltstone origin.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent paragravel. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A2 or AB (when present) horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent paragravel. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and 4 to 6 dry. Texture is a silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent paragravel. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid in the upper part and very strongly acid or strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 8 moist and dry. Texture is a silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 27 to 50 percent clay. It has 15 to 60 percent paragravel. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nIn pedons that have been significantly influenced by diorite, the Bt and BCt horizons will range to 5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goodin soils are on ridges and side slopes of hills at elevations of 200 to 900 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone of the Yamhill and Keasey Formations. In some areas, diorite is interbedded between layers of the Yamhill Formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is 160 to 210 days."

Dupee soils are greater than 40 inches to a paralithic contact, have iron depletions with a chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the surface and are on concave parts of the hillslope. Hazelair soils are very-fine, have a mollic epipedon and are on linear parts of the hillslope. Melbourne soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and are on linear to concave parts of the hillslope. Panther soils are greater than 40 inches to a paralithic contact, have a chroma of 2 and redox concentrations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and are on concave parts of the hillslope. Rickreall soils are 12 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact and are on convex parts of the hillslope."
