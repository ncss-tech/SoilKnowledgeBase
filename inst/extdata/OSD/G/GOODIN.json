  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone, and diorite. Goodin soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.",

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone of the Yamhill and Keasey Formations. In some areas, diorite is interbedded between layers of the Yamhill Formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is 160 to 210 days."
