  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The A1 ranges in color from dark grayish brown to gray (10YR 4/2 to 5/1) and very dark grayish brown to black (10YR 3/2 to 2/1) when moist.  Texture may be loam, clay loam, or heavy clay loam.   The surface is usually very slightly to slightly calcareous with lime being disseminated and may occur in slightly to violently effervescent seams below 40 inches.  The B2 may be a light loam, heavy loam, or a fine sandy clay loam and ranges from 10YR 4/1 to 4/2 and 7.5YR 4/4.  The B3 and C1 horizons are discontinuous within short (2 to 5 feet) distances.  The solum ranges in thickness from 30 to 55 inches usually being 40 to 48 inches thick.  The substratum varies considerably from grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam mixed sediments to brown (7.5YR 4/4) hardpan material underlying the adjacent San Joaquin soils.  There are many medium (5 to 15 mm) iron and manganese concretions throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Glann soils occur in the same general area as Alamo, Columbia, Freeport, Oakley, Sacramento, and San Joaquin soils.  They resemble Chino and Temple soils.  Chino soils are slightly finer textured, have lower chromas in the B and C horizons, and have moderately calcareous B3ca horizons.  Temple soils are finer textured, with lower chromas and values and with less red hues in the B and C horizons and much more lime in the lower sola than the Glann or Chino soils."

An intermittent water table usually exists within 3 to 4 feet of the surface."
