Hollandlake soils have a udic moisture regime.  Larand soils have sandy-skeletal 2C horizons.  Leadville soils have hue of 5YR in a major part of the solum and C horizon. Tolvar soils have a large percentage of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand in the fine earth, and have \"hard setting\" properties when dry."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Granile soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived principally from gneiss, schist, and granitic rocks.  Elevation is 8,000 to 10,000 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches with a peak period of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost free period is 20 to 70 days."
