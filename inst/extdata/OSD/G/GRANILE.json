  "OVERVIEW": "The Granile series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and hills. These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived principally from gneiss, schist, and granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
