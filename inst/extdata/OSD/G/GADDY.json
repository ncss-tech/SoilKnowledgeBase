  "REVDATE": "01/2016",
  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaddy series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium of Holocene age. These soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).",
