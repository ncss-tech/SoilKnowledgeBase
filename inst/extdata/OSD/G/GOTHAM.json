  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Gotham soils typically do not have coarse fragments but volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 12 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout the soil. Carbonates are absent to a depth of 80 inches or more. Loamy substratum and sandstone substratum phases are recognized in some places.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture typically is loamy fine sand or loamy sand, but in some pedons it is fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand with at least 3 percent more clay than the overlying eluvial horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand."

Bristol and Vistula soils are more than 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and in addition, Vistula soils have redox features in the lower part of the series control section. Lilah soils have a loamy mantle 10 to 20 inches thick.   Montieth soils have Bt horizons consisting entirely of lamellae and a have paralithic contact between a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  Shavenaugh soils have carbonates within the series control section."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Ap);\nArgillic horizon - 8 to 29 inches (Bt1, Bt2);\nPsammentic feature - texture of loamy fine sand or coarser throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe former typical pedon was in Richland County but the Gotham series was not correlated there during the update so a new typical pedon is used from Green Lake County.\nField and possibly lab analysis are needed to determine if this soil has an argillic horizon.\nField checking is needed to determine if lamellae are typical in this series. The taxonomic unit descriptions from Marquette and Eau Claire Counties describe sandy loam bands in the C horizon. The field description for this Green Lake County Wisconsin pedon also indicates argillic bands in the C horizon.\nThere are 15,830 acres are correlated in Marquette County as a loamy substratum phase (13,390 acres with loamy fine sand surface and 2442 acres with fine sandy loam surface).\nThere are 500 acres correlated in Green Lake County as a sandstone substratum phase (20-40 inches to sandstone) and 1380 acres in Eau Claire County (40-60 inches to sandstone).\nThere are 580 acres are correlated in Rock County as a bedrock variant (20-40 inches to dolomite).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
