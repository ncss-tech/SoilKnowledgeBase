These soils formed in residuum weather from cherty limestone and dolomite. The mean annual temperature varies from 54 to 57 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches."

Alred and Ocie soils have a loamy-skeletal over clayey particle size class.  Britwater soils have a fine-loamy particle size family and are on terraces below the Gobbler soils.  Gasconade, Knobby, and Moko soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Hailey and Rueter soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size family. Sonsac soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Alred, Gasconade, Sonsac, and Ocie soils are on ridge tops, side slopes, and structural benches. Hailey and Rueter soils are on side slopes at higher elevations. Moko and Knobby soils are on knobs and south and west facing slopes."
