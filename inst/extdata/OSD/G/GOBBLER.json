  "OVERVIEW": "The Gobbler series consists of deep, well drained soils on uplands.  They formed in residuum weathered from cherty limestone and dolomite on ridgetops and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
