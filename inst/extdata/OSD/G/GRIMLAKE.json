  "OVERVIEW": "The Grimlake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Grimlake soils are on alluvial flats and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
