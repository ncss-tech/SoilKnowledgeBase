  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 2 to 10 inches.  Free carbonates are at or within a few inches of the surface.  The series control section averages between 35 and 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Few or common glacial stones and boulders are on the surface or partially embedded in most areas.  Few or common pebbles and cobbles are mixed throughout the profile in most pedons.  Mottles are inherent in the parent material and range from few to many, faint to prominent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are clay loam or clay.  The C horizon contains thin strata of coarser textures in the lower part in some pedons.  The Bk horizon contains common or many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate in most pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Few to many, fine or medium striations or nests of gypsum are in most pedons.  Bedded shale is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gettys soils are undulating to steep on uplands in rolling to hilly glacial moraines and side slopes of drainageways.  Surfaces are convex and slope gradients typically are greater than 15 percent, but range from 6 to 45 percent.  The Gettys soils formed in firm clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Betts, Oko, Peno, Raber, and Sansarc soils.  Betts soils are on similar landscapes and are fine-loamy.  Oko, Peno, and Raber soils are on the smoother parts of the landscape and have argillic horizons.  Sansarc soils are in the lower parts of some of the steeper landscapes and have bedded shale at depths of less than 20 inches."
