  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 40 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. Rock fragments in the particle size-control section range from 35 to 75 percent and are mainly pebbles or channers in size.  Clay ranges from 25 to 35 percent in the particle size control section.  This soil is usually calcareous throughout but may be leached a few inches from the surface. Hard bedrock is common at depths of 40 to 60 inches or more in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grotte soils are on fans and mountain hillslopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation at the type location is about 16 inches but ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 42 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 58 to 63 degrees F. The average frost free period is 80 to 105 days."
