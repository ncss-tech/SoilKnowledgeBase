  "OVERVIEW": "The Grotte series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from sandstone.  Grotte soils are on fans and mountain hillslopes and have slopes of 10 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

Rock fragments in the particle size-control section range from 35 to 75 percent and are mainly pebbles or channers in size.  Clay ranges from 25 to 35 percent in the particle size control section.  This soil is usually calcareous throughout but may be leached a few inches from the surface. Hard bedrock is common at depths of 40 to 60 inches or more in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3."
