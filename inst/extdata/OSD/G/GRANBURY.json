  "REVDATE": "09/2020",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Granbury series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey slope alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These  gently sloping soils occur on crests of low ridges on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 801 mm (31.5 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17.6 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
