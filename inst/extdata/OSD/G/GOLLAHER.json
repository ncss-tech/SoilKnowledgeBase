  "OVERVIEW": "The Gollaher series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone or other strongly calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Gollaher soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
