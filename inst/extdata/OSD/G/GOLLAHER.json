These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from limestone or other strongly calcareous sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,740 to 2,685 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm; the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
