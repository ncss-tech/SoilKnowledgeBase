Texture of the upper part of the particle size control section is silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Texture of the lower part of the control section is dominantly fine sand or sand.  Depth to the contrasting sandy and gravelly material is 12 to 30 inches.  Coarse fragment content of the lower control section ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline in the solum and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2, 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2 or 3.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  Colors often occur in horizontal and convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam.  Cobble and gravel content is less than 5 percent.\nA C horizon may be present in some pedons.  Moist hue ranges from 10YR to 5Y; most value from 3 to 5; and moist chroma from 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam.  Cobble and gravel content is less than 10 percent.  Thickness ranges from 0 to 14 inches.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue from 10YR to 5Y; moist value from 1 to 4; and moist chroma from 1 to 4.  Colors are variegated and dark due to the high content of black sand grains.  Textures include sand and fine sand.   Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent with 35 to 75 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobble.  Lime coatings are present on the undersides of many coarse fragments."
