  "OVERVIEW": "The Globe series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils with slow permeability.  They formed in clayey pluvial lake sediments.  These soils are on depressional lake plains and playas on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

Armijo soils formed in alluvium in areas of oxbow lakes and sloughs on broad, usually channeled, flood plains or concave terraces around playas.  Dalby soils are well drained and have a Bk horizon with 5 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Montoya soils are well drained and receive greater than 10 inches precipitation, contain hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, and have soil temperature that range from 60 to 62 degrees F.  Reefridge soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface."
