Armijo soils formed in alluvium in areas of oxbow lakes and sloughs on broad, usually channeled, flood plains or concave terraces around playas.  Dalby soils are well drained and have a Bk horizon with 5 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Montoya soils are well drained and receive greater than 10 inches precipitation, contain hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, and have soil temperature that range from 60 to 62 degrees F.  Reefridge soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface."
