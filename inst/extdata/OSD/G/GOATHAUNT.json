  "OVERVIEW": "The Goathaunt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over till and colluvium derived from mixed metasedimentary material. These soils are on glacial-valley floors and glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
