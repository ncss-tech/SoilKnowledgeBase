  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 3 to 16 inches.  The fibric horizon ranges in hue from 2.5YR to 5YR, with values of 2 to 3 and chromas of 1 to 3.  The sapric horizon ranges in hue from 10R to 5YR, with values of 2 to 3 and chromas of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have a hemic horizon either in place of a sapric horizon or immediately below it.  Coarse woody particles may occur in any of the organic horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the McGilvery, Sokolof, Tebenkof, Sunnyhay, and Tolstoi series.  The McGilvery soils have no hemic or sapric horizons.  The Sokolof and Tebenkof series have fragmental substrata.  The Sunnyhay soils consist of thin sapric horizons over bedrock and are usually wet.  The Tolstoi soils have spodic horizons developed in skeletal materials over shallow bedrock.  None of these soils freeze deeply in winter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Guguak soils over rock outcrops surrounded by areas of organic soils.  The climate is cool maritime, with mean annual precipitation of more than 80 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. and the mean summer air temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at the soil-rock interface is about 52 degrees F.  Because of their exposed position which permits snow to be blown away easily, these soils are often frozen during the winter months."
