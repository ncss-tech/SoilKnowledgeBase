  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaston series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridges and side slopes of the Piedmont uplands. They formed in residuum weathered from mixed intermediate and mafic crystalline rock such as hornblende, gneiss, quartz diorite, gabbro, and hornblende schist.  Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 6 feet.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.  Most pedons have few to common flakes of mica in the B horizon and few to many flakes of mica in the BC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of less than 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The A horizon, where present, is at least 6 inches thick.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 8 when moist.  Dry value less than 5 that is no more than 1 unit higher than the moist value is restricted to the upper subhorizons of the Bt horizon.  High chroma mottles and dark streaks or stains occur in most pedons. It is clay or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  High chroma mottles and dark streaks or stains occur in most pedons.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  It is saprolite weathered from mixed acid and basic crystalline rock that has loamy textures."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Farragut series is the only other known series in the same family.  Farragut soils have textures of silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the Bt horizon and are formed from a thin layer of colluvium over shale residuum.  Series in closely related families are the Cecil, Clifton, Coronaca, Cullen, Davidson, Georgeville, Gwinnett, Hanceville, Lloyd, Madison, Mecklenburg, Pacolet, Stoneville, and Tatum series.  Cecil, Coronaca, Davidson, Georgeville, Gwinnett, Lloyd, Madison, and Pacolet soils are kaolinitic.  In addition Cecil, Georgeville, Madison, and Pacolet soils do not have horizons with moist value less than 4.  Madison soils have a high content of mica flakes.  Pacolet soils have thinner clayey horizons. Coronaca soils are Alfisols.  Coronaca, Davidson, Gwinnett, and Lloyd soils have rhodic colors throughout or in the upper part of the kandic horizon.  Cullen soils do not have A horizons as thick as 6 inches that have moist value less than 3.5.  Hanceville and Stoneville soils have rhodic colors throughout the argillic horizon and  formed in residuum weathered from sedimentary rock.  Clifton, Mecklenburg, and Tatum soils do not have A horizons thicker than 6 inches that have moist value less than 4.  Clifton soils are mesic. Mecklenburg soils are less acid and have slow permeability.  Tatum soils formed in sericite schist or phyllite."

Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 15 percent but range from 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from mixed basic and acidic crystalline rocks such as quartz diorite, granite, gabbro, hornblende gneiss, mafic gneiss, and hornblende schist.  Near the type location, average annual precipitation is about 48 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F."

Cecil, Cullen, Davidson, Gwinnett, Lloyd, Madison, Mecklenburg, and Pacolet soils occur in the same landscape positions as Gaston soils.  Enon, Helena, Iredell, and Sedgefield soils are on toe slopes OR THE smoother parts of ridges.  In addition, Enon, Helena, Iredell, and Sedgefield soils have yellower hue and Helena, Iredell, and Sedgefield soils have low chroma mottles in the B horizon.  In addition, Iredell soils are smectitic.  Worsham soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less and are in depressions and along intermittent drains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was formerly included with Cullen series and originally fitted in the concept of the Lloyd series in North Carolina.  The large acreage (25,000 acres in Gaston and Lincoln Cos., NC) of soil similar to Cullen but having dark surface layers with moist value less than 3.5 and dry value less than 6 in the Ap horizon supports proposal of this series.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 6 inches to a depth of 47 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)."
