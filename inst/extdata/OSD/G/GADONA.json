There is more than 35 percent clay by weighted average in the particle size\ncontrol section.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon (when present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or silt.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay or clay with occasional pockets and lenses of silty clay loam and clay loam; Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble; Slight to strong effervescences in the lower horizons of some pedons.  The reaction is mildly acid to moderately alkaline."
