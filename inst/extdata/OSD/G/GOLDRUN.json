  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldrun series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and lacustrine sands derived from mixed rocks with some influence from volcanic ash.  The Goldrun soils are on sand dunes and sand sheets.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Grandora soils have clay films and lack effervescence. Hotsprings soils have a particle-size control section of gravelly loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand with 20 to 35 percent fine gravel.  Incy soils are noncalcareous throughout their profiles.  Lachim, Painter, Quinton, Rinquin and Walco soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Quincy soils have dominantly dark basaltic mineral grains with moist values of 3 or 4 in the series control sections. Toll soils have loamy sands and are medium acid to neutral in the series control sections.  Winchester soils have sand and loamy sand in the series control sections with more than 75 percent medium sand or coarser. Zorravista soils are strongly to weakly effervescent at depth of 0 to 50 cm and are strongly influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials."
