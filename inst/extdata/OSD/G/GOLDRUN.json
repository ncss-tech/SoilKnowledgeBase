Grandora soils have clay films and lack effervescence. Hotsprings soils have a particle-size control section of gravelly loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand with 20 to 35 percent fine gravel.  Incy soils are noncalcareous throughout their profiles.  Lachim, Painter, Quinton, Rinquin and Walco soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Quincy soils have dominantly dark basaltic mineral grains with moist values of 3 or 4 in the series control sections. Toll soils have loamy sands and are medium acid to neutral in the series control sections.  Winchester soils have sand and loamy sand in the series control sections with more than 75 percent medium sand or coarser. Zorravista soils are strongly to weakly effervescent at depth of 0 to 50 cm and are strongly influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldrun soils are on sand dunes, beach plains, and sand sheets.  These soils formed in eolian and lacustrine sands derived from mixed rocks with some influence from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,100 to 1,740 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
