  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches thick. The upper sediment does not have rock fragments.  The clayey lower part of the control section contains from 0 to 9 percent gravel and cobbles of mixed lithology.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The salinity ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm/cm throughout the series control section.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam but some are silt loam or silty clay.  It averages 1 to 10 percent very fine sand or coarser.  The A horizon contains 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have tongues of A horizon extending into the Bk horizon.\nAn Ak horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and a chroma of 1 to 4.  It is a silty clay loam or silt loam, averaging 18 to 34 percent clay and 1 to 10 percent very fine sand or coarser.  It contains 15 to more than 30 percent calcium carbonate.  Most of this is disseminated or occurs as masses or threads.  Some pedons contain few or common, faint to prominent redoximorphic concentrations in this horizon.\nA Bky or BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In some pedons below 30 inches the hue is neutral and the chroma is 1 or less.  The texture of the C horizon is typically silty clay loam or silt loam.  In some pedons there are thin strata of very fine sandy loam, silt loam and silty clay loam, averaging 18 to 34 percent clay and 1 to 10 percent very fine sand or coarser.\nIn some pedons a thin layer of sands and gravel occurs between the Cg horizon and the 2Cg horizon\nThe 2Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture of the 2Cg horizon is typically clay or silty clay, averaging 40 to 70 percent clay, 5 to 20 percent fine sand or coarser, 0 to 5 percent gravels and 0 to 1 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gunclub soils are on level and nearly level lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils are formed in calcareous silty lacustrine sediments over clayey till.  The climate is cool and subhumid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  Frost free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1050 feet."

Colvin and Perella soils are in a drainage sequence with Bearden soils.  Colvin and Perella soils are in swales and lower lying flats and basins.  Colvin soils are poorly drained.  Perella soils do not have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface.  Nielsville soils are poorly drained.  Wheatville soils are coarse-silty"
