    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apalona, Ava, Bedford, Cincinnati, Fountainville, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, Weisburg, and Zanesville series. Apalona soils formed in 30 to 48 inches of silty loess and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum. Ava soils formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits, and have a 2B horizon that contains more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 60 inches. Bedford soils have clayey residuum weathered from limestone at depths of less than 60 inches and have redder hue. Cincinnati soils formed in loess and glacial till; they have a 2B horizon at depths less than 40 inches that contains more than 15 percent sand and between 2 and 20 percent rock fragments. Fountainville soils are formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying material weathered from metamorphic and sedimentary brown and red shale, siltstone and sandstone residuum. Hildebrecht and Weisburg soils have less than 40 inches of loess and contain more clay and rock fragments in the lower part of the solum. Hosmer soils typically are in areas of thicker loess and typically have higher base saturation in the series control section. Lawrenceville soils do not have a bisequal profile with the Bt/E horizon and the B't horizon. Nicholson soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the layers below the fragipan. Omulga and Otwell soils are stratified in the lower part of the sola and in the substrata. Otwood soils have more than 20 percent sand in the layers below the fragipan. Solsberry soils formed in loess, a thin layer of loamy pedisediment and a paleosol formed in the underlying Illinoian age till with more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Zanesville soils formed in thinner loess over residuum weathered from acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale and contain more sand and rock fragments within a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grantsburg soils are commonly on the ridge crests and side slopes of bedrock controlled uplands that may have remnants of old glacial drift. Slope gradients are 2 to 18 percent. Grantsburg soils formed in 122 to 203 centimeters (48 to 80 inches) of late Wisconsinan Stage Peoria Loess and are usually underlain by Roxana silt, erosional sediments, and/or Illinoian Stage Loveland loess that contains a reddish paleosol, or residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone, shale, or siltstone with low content of sand. In some pedons the solum formed into the underlying silty materials. Bedrock is at a depth of 1.5 to 3.6 meters (5 to 12 feet). Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (54 to 57 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1168 millimeters (42 to 46 inches), frost free period ranges from 175 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 110 to 201 meters (360 to 660 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the the Robbs, Wellston soils and Zanesville soils. The somewhat poorly drained Robbs soils have chroma of 2 or less in the upper 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the argillic horizon and form a hydrosequence with the Grantsburg soils. Zanesville and Wellston soils are on similar or steeper adjacent slopes where the loess is thinner. Wellston soils do not have a fragipan horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/sec) in the subsoil horizons above the fragipan and low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/sec) in the fragipan. Permeability is moderately slow in the subsoil horizons above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan. A perched, seasonal water table is at a depth of 46 to 76 centimeters (1.5 to 2.5 feet) from December through April in most years."

The concepts and earlier studies of the Grantsburg series was summarized in a booklet prepared for the Benchmark Soils Project: McCormack, D. E. 1960. Grantsburg Soils - A Summary of Pertinent Data for use in Classification and Interpretation. Soil Conservation Service. Water is perched on the B't horizon or on the fragipan, and free water flows laterally through or above the Bt/E horizon.\nThe Nasis Data Mapunit ID is: 153525. This data mapunit represents the OSD pedon for Grantsburg.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (7 inches), (A and E horizons); Argillic horizon - the zone from about 31 to 96 centimeters (12 to 38 inches), (Bt1, Bt2, Bt/E, and B't horizons); and a Fragipan - the zone from about 96 to 155 centimeters (38 to 61 inches), (Btx1 and Btx2 horizons); Redoximorphic features - from 31 to 203 centimeters (12 to 80 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from the typical pedon, laboratory numbers 17582 to 17594, University of Illinois, are on file at the SCS state office.\nNSSL laboratory pedon number is: 40A2760 (Pedon ID number 49IL151001)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
