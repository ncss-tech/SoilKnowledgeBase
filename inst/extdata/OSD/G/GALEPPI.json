  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Galeppi soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granodiorite and andesite and may be modified by lacustrine deposites.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,220 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 360 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 130 days."
