  "OVERVIEW": "The Galeppi series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Galeppi soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
