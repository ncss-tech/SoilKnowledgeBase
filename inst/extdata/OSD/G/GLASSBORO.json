Dragston soils are in a thermic family and are Aeric Endoaquults.\nThe 6/2006 revision changes status from tentative to established. Measurements were converted to metric and other minor revisions were also made.\nThe 5/2008 revision adds horizon features that were missing in the previous description.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 28 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 66 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Btg horizons)\nAquic conditions--the zone below 41 cm that is periodically saturated (endosaturation)\nOther soil features identified in this pedon are:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nReference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Hammonton, New Jersey.\nDatabase Information:\nOSD Data Mapunit ID: 424407\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID: 407452\nOSD User Pedon ID: Glassboro-OSD\nREVISED: 11/2002-SCK, JAK; 06/2006-DHK; 05/2008-EM, DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
