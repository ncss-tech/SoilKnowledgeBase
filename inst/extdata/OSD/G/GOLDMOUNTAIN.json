  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldmountain series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary sources. The Goldmountain soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 480 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
