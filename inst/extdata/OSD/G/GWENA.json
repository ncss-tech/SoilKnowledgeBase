    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gwena soils are on fan-piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
