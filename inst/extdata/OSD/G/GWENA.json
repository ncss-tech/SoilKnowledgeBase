  "OVERVIEW": "The Gwena series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Gwena soils are on fan-piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
