  "OVERVIEW": "The Glentivar series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, and shale.  Glentivar soils are on hills or pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
