  "OVERVIEW": "The Glynn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans and terraces.  They formed in alluvial sediments weathered from volcanic residuum.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

Arawak soils are on higher positions and are shallow to weathered limestone.  Carib, Hesselberg, Sandy Point, Sion, Solitude, and Sugar Beach soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Carib soils are in flood plains, have fine-loamy particle-size control sections, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Hesselberg soils are on marine terraces and are shallow to a root restrictive petrocalcic horizon. Sandy Point and Sugar Beach soils are in saline marshes and flats and are very poorly drained.  Sion soils are on higher side slopes and valley floors.  Solitude soils are on lower positions and are somewhat poorly drained.  Lameshur soils are on similar positions but have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections."
