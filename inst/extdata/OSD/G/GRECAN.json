These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, dolomite and conglomerate. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 381 to 508 mm, much of which falls as snow or spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. Frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
