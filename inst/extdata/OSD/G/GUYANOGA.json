  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 36 through 76 centimeters (14 to 30 inches) and depth to carbonates, where present, ranges from 102 through 191 centimeters (40 to 75 inches). Bedrock is deeper than 152 centimeters (60 inches). Rock fragments, mostly dark shale and siltstone fragments, some may be pararock fragments, range from 5 through 50 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and from 10 through 85 percent in individual horizons of the of the lower B horizon and C horizons. The weighted average of total rock fragment content in the particle-size control section is greater than 35 percent. The soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the A and B horizons, and is more than pH 6.0 at 76.2 centimeters (30 inches) depth. The C horizon ranges from moderately acid through moderately alkaline. The fine-earth portion of the control section has greater than 18 percent clay, weighted average.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons may contain a buried A horizon at various depths.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate fine, medium, or coarse subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 5. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive or may have plate-like divisions. It is loose through firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alton, Cates, and Pennichuck soils. Alton soils have fine and coarser sand that ranges from 50 to 70 percent in the solum. The Cates soils formed in residuum from siltstone, and the Pennichuck soils formed in loamy till underlain by unweathered phyllite.\nHerkimer soils are in a related family to Guyanoga soils and have been mapped in similar landscape positions, but have a coarse-loamy particle size."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Guyanoga soils are on alluvial fans formed below bedrock controlled uplands dominated by shale and thinly bedded siltstone. Slope ranges from 0 through 15 percent. Mean annual temperature of 7.3 through 9.1 degrees C. (45 through 48.4 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation of 79 through 112 centimeters (31 through 44 inches).

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Dark colored shale in the parent material creates a lithochromic situation. Dark colors do not indicate the presence of a Mollic horizon. In addition, the dark colored shale contains inorganic carbon that should not be construed as suggesting Fluventic.\nThis series was proposed during the updates of Ontario and Yates counties in New York State. Most of the areas were originally mapped as Chagrin, fan phase (symbols Cs, and Cr in the original 1958 survey). Some of the areas that were mapped as Chenango, fan phase (symbol Ct in the 1958 survey) were also correlated to Guyanoga. These areas are dominantly loamy-skeletal and have greater than 18 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction. They did not classify the same as Herkimer or Chagrin series. During future MLRA updates, areas previously mapped as Chagrin, fan phase and Herkimer series should be investigated to see if some areas might now fit the Guyanoga series.\nThe series is named after Guyanoga, a hamlet in Yates County, NY. Pronounced (Gu-ya-no-ga) it is the name of a Seneca Indian Chief, who was, according to legend, an extraordinary Indian, a giant of a man, and a Seneca chief who was a friend of General George Washington and the early colonists.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 30 centimeters to 48 centimeters (12 to 19 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for this pedon: S09NY123-029. Additional data is available from pedons: S08NY069-033; S09NY123-024; S09NY123-026; and S09NY123-027. The data is available from the NSSC Soil Survey Lab characterization database website: http://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov/default.htm\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
