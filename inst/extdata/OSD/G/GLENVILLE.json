  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenville series consists of very deep moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils. They formed primarily in colluvium or residuum affected by soil creep that is weathered from phyllite, micaceous schist, granitic gneiss and other acid crystalline rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high. Mean annual precipitation is 1145 mm (45 inches). Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Rock fragments of phyllite, schist, gneiss or quartzite generally increase with depth, ranging from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Some pedons have flakes of mica that generally increases with depth. Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid in the A horizon, moderately acid to very strongly acid in the B horizon, and moderately or very strongly acid in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value 3 to 5 and chroma 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth.\nThe Bt horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 to 6 and chroma 3 to 8. Low chroma redoximorphic features are within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth.\nThe Btx or Btgx horizons have hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 to 6 and chroma 2 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth material is loam or silt loam. Consistence is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe BC or BCg horizons have the same color and texture as the Btx or Btgx horizon.\nThe C or Cg horizons have hue 2.5YR to 10YR, value 4 to 6 and chroma 1 to 8. Fine earth texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

Cookport soils are deep and very deep, formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and occur on the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau.  Kedron soils are very deep, are formed in colluvium or glacial till from reddish shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone and typically have hues of 2.5YR or redder in the solum. Raritan soils are very deep and formed in alluvium from red shale, siltstone and sandstone and contain rounded rock fragments and stratified sand, silt and gravel."

The Glenville soils have developed in residuum or colluvium affected by soil creep that is weathered from phyllite, micaceous schist, gneiss and other acid crystalline rocks. The climate is temperate and humid with average annual temperature of 48 degrees to 57 degrees F, and average annual precipitation of about 40 to 50 inches. The growing season ranges from about 160 to 200 days."

Aquic conditions the zone from 16 to 33 inches (Bt2, Btx, and Btgx horizons).\n1992: Revised to reflect depth to bedrock range of more than 60 inches.\n2003: Type location relocated and series concept modified to reflect a shift from pure residuum to either colluvium or, at a minimum, residuum affected by soil creep. Former type location did not have redoximorphic features described above the fragipan.\n2008:\tPedon description and site location updated\nPrevious revision:  MAV 04/2004"
