  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Graybert soils are on stream terraces and on foot slopes to uplands of high, dry, ancient valleys.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 11 percent.  Surfaces are plane or concave.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of recent reworked coarse-silty soil material that overlies fine-silty soil material.  The range of mean annual temperature is from 46 to 58 degrees F, and the range of mean annual precipitation is from 16 to 26 inches."

Hord soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine-silty control section and are on similar positions in the landscape.  Kenesaw soils are shallower to carbonates.  They occupy a hummocky landscape with a poorly defined drainage pattern."
