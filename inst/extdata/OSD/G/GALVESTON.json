  "OVERVIEW": "The Galveston series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable soils) that formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils occur on back-barrier flats on barrier islands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils are occasionally flooded with salt water during severe storms.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
