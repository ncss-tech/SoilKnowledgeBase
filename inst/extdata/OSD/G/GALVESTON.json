Internal drainage is rapid above the water table.  Permeability is rapid.  A water table is at depths of 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 in) in normal years.  Following storms or very high tides the water table approaches the surface for a period of a few days in some areas.  These soils are occasionally inundated with salt water during cyclonic storms."
