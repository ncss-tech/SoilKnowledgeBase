  "OVERVIEW": "The Gurabo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soil on alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvial sediments derived from igneous rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 85 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",
