The particle-size control section contains less than 5 percent coarse fragments and ranges from loamy fine sand to fine sand.  Sodium absorption ratio ranges from 15 to 35 in more than half of the upper 20 inches of the soil and decreases with depth below 20 inches.  Depth to the duripan is 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe Akzn horizon has hue of 7.5YR 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  The lower part is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand and is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe Bkzn horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline with strong or violent effervescence.\nThe Bkgz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 0 through 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline with strong or violent effervescence.\nThe Bkqmz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 0 through 3 dry or moist.  It is weakly to strongly cemented.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline with strong or violent effervescence.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gooseflats soils are in draws and valley flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium mainly from outwash material of mixed mineralogy.  Elevations range from 800 to 2,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 73 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
