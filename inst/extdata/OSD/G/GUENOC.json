  "OVERVIEW": "The Guenoc series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from volcanic and metamorphic rocks, mainly basaltic rock.  Guenoc soils are on foothills and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
