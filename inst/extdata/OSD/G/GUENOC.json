The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 50 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature varies from 56 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 160 to 250 days."
