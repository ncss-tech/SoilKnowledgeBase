Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent; the well drained phase, which is no longer part of the series concept and will become a new series, has slopes ranging from 12 to 35 percent. The Glennie soils formed in dense fractured till that is underlain by coarse textured stratified glaciofluvium at depths greater than 3 meters (10 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F)."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the upper part and low in the fragipan and substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the fragipan and substratum."
