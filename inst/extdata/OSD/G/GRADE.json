  "OVERVIEW": "The Grade series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite. These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.",
