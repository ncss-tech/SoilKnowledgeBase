Bezzant soils are moderately permeable and are formed in coarser alluvial material and lack the loess and silty alluvium influence in the upper part of the pedon.  Cedarhill soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Dennot soils are moderately permeable, have hues redder than 7.5YR, have less than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the control section and lack influence from loess and silty alluvium.  Pyrenees soils have lithic contact at depths less than 40 inches."
