    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The soil below a depth of 5 inches is usually dry in all parts from May or June until late October or early November and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The base saturation is 75 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel size, range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soil is medium acid to neutral.  The organic matter is 1.5 to 6 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and averages less than 18 percent clay.  The soil has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have a thin Bw horizon or C horizon between the A horizon and the bedrock.  It is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 sandy loam or loam and averages less than 18 percent clay."

The soils formed in material weathered from hard schist, granite rocks, sandstone, and shale.  The climate is subhumid with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 25 inches and there is some snow.  The mean annual temperature is 51 degrees to 60 degrees F., January temperature is about 40 degrees F., July temperature is about 74 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 150 to 275 days."
