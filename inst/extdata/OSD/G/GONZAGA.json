They are being differentiated from the Vallecitos series by being moderately deep and having a mollic epipedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n--Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 16 inches  (A1, A2)\n--Argillic horizon- the zone from 22 to 39 inches (Bt1, Bt2)\n--Lithic contact - the boundary at 39 inches (R1, R2)\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area.\nRunoff terminology of rapid or very rapid, adjusted 9/96 to adjective criteria of very hig from the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
