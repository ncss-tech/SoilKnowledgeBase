The soils formed in material weathered from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Formation.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 59 to 61 degrees F.

They are being differentiated from the Vallecitos series by being moderately deep and having a mollic epipedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n--Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 16 inches  (A1, A2)\n--Argillic horizon- the zone from 22 to 39 inches (Bt1, Bt2)\n--Lithic contact - the boundary at 39 inches (R1, R2)\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area.\nRunoff terminology of rapid or very rapid, adjusted 9/96 to adjective criteria of very hig from the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
