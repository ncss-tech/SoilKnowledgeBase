Dovecanyon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 18 to 22 degrees C. Goldivide, Helendale, and Searchlight soils receive summer precipitation and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Searchlight soils are also calcareous throughout. Sonoita soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October. Tray soils are calcareous throughout and have strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP) of 15 to 30 percent. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters."
