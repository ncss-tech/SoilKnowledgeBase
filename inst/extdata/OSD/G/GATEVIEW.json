  "OVERVIEW": "The Gateview series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvial or colluvial material from sedimentary rocks and glacial materials of mixed origin.  Gateview soils are on outwash terraces, toeslopes, alluvial fans, till plains, kames, esters, mountains, and low ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
