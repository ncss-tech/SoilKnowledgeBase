  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaylesville series consists of deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to stream terraces, they are frequently flooded and are saturated to near the surface in winter and early spring.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to extremely acid throughout.  Flakes of mica range from none to few throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, is mottled with shades of yellow, red, brown, and gray or it has hue of 10YR, value of 5 and 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe Btg horizon is mottled with shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray, and has shades or gray as dominant color on the faces of peds.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or\nclay.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to about 55 percent.  In some pedons, without a BE horizon, the upper part of the Bt horizon has the same range in texture, hue, value, and chroma as the BE horizon."

Grubbs soils have redder subsoils that are slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Tupelo soils, which are underlain by limestone bedrock, have browner colors in their upper B horizon."
