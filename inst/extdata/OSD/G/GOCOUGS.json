In addition, Foxtrot soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C., calcium carbonate equivalence of 15 to 40 percent in the fine earth, and are derived from eolian sands over alluvium. Winerton soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 18 degrees C, a sodium adsorption ratio of greater than 30 within the A horizon(s) and 13 to 30 in all subsurface horizons, an indurated petrocalcic horizon, and can be gleyed in C horizons below the cemented layer."
