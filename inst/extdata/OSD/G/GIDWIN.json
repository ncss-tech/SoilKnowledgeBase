    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 45 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 4 percent. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches. The mollic epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick and includes all of the argillic horizon. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon is cobbly silt loam, gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and a chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It is very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely cobbly loam. It has 35 to 85 percent rock fragments."

Anaud soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days after the summer solstice. Bellenmine and Cleavage soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 10 inches thick. Cleavmor soils are usually dry and have lime in seams or filaments in the Btk horizons. Cropper soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 10 inches thick and 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section. Gabica soils have moderately slow permeability and are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Gaciba soils are mollic only in part of the argillic horizon and have an aridic soil moisture regime. Grosschat soils receive 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation between July and October and a mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick. Hutchley soils have 24 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Mascamp soils are usually dry and have lime coatings on the bedrock surface. Melling soil shave 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Pernog soils are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Pernty soils have mollic epipedons 7 to 10 inches thick which includes only the upper Bt horizon and are dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Poisoncreek soils have a Cr horizon above the bedrock. Rozara soils contain 14 to 18 percent clay in the control section and have a lithic contact at 10 to 14 inches. Shalcleav soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mainly channers and flagstones in the profile. Slatter soils have a lithic contact at 4 to 10 inches. Shalper soils have mollic epipedons that are 4 to 12 inches thick and have moderately slow permeability. Tractuff soils have Btk horizons with secondary carbonates and an aridic soil moisture regime. Tweener soils have 25 to 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section and moderately slow permeability."
