  "OVERVIEW": "The Greybrook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in lacustrine deposits. The soils are on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
