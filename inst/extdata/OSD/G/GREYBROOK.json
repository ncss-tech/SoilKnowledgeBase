Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 152 to 244 meters (500 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches)(A1, A2, E, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 157 cm (15 to 62 inches) (2Bt, 2Btg horizons).\nRelic redoximorphic features: at 63 to 203 cm (25 to 80 inches). The mottles and matrix colors with chroma of 1 or 2 and the iron concentrations are relic features which do not indicate present drainage conditions.\nThese soils were mapped Otwell, calcareous substratum, in the 1964 Owen County Soil Survey.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE for the typical pedon S91IN-119-45.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
