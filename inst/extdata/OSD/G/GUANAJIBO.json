  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guanajibo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on coastal terraces and alluvial fans on humid coastal plains.  They formed in fine textured sediments of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 68 inches.   Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",
