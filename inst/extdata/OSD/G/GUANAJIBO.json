Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of ironstone pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Content of ironstone pebbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe upper part of the Btv horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Iron accumulations in shades of red range from few to common.  Content of ironstone pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe lower part of the Btv horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Content of ironstone pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Content of plinthite ranges from 10 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay."

The moderately well drained Cabo Rojo soils are on higher positions and have less clay in the control section.  Nipe and Delicias soils are Oxisols and have darker red subsoils.  In addition, Delicias soils are on similar to higher positions and have less clay in the control section.  Nipe soils are on higher positions."
