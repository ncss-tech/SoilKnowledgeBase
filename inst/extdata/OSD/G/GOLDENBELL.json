  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldenbell soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and gneiss with an eolian influence. Elevations are 150 to 850 meters (490 to 2,790 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Descent soils are sandy-skeletal throughout the particle-size control section. Rainbowsend and Oldale soils are also on fan remnants. Rainbowsend soils do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to an indurated pan. Oldale soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and do not have a duripan. Carrizo soils are on adjacent alluvial fans and drainageways, do not have any diagnostic horizons and are sandy-skeletal throughout the particle size control section."
