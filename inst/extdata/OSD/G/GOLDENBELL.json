  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldenbell series consists of shallow, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and gneiss with an eolian influence. Goldenbell soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Rainbowsend soils do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to an indurated pan. Oldale soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and do not have a duripan. Carrizo soils are on adjacent alluvial fans and drainageways, do not have any diagnostic horizons and are sandy-skeletal throughout the particle size control section."
