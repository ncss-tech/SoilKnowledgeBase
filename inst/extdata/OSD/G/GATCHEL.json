  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gatchel soils are on narrow flood plains and alluvial fans of drainageways that dissect steep and very steep hills. Slopes range form 0 to 2 percent. They formed in loamy alluvium containing a high percentage of rock fragments in the lower part. The alluvial sediments washed from areas of interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1194 mm (40 to 47 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Haymond, moderately well drained Wilbur and well drained Wirt soils are typically on slightly higher lying flood plains or flood-plain steps and contain less rock fragments. They are also associated with Adyeville, Ebal, Gilpin, Tipsaw, and Wellston soils on hill slopes. The well drained, moderately deep Adyeville, Gilpin and Tipsaw soils are on backslopes. The moderately well drained, deep or very deep Ebal soils are on backslopes. The well drained, deep or very deep Wellston soils are on backslopes."
