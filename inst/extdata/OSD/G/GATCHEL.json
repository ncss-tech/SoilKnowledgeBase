  "OVERVIEW": "The Gatchel series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on flood plains. They formed in loamy alluvium containing a high percentage of rock fragments in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

They formed in loamy alluvium containing a high percentage of rock fragments in the lower part. The alluvial sediments washed from areas of interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1194 mm (40 to 47 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200."

They are also associated with Adyeville, Ebal, Gilpin, Tipsaw, and Wellston soils on hill slopes. The well drained, moderately deep Adyeville, Gilpin and Tipsaw soils are on backslopes. The moderately well drained, deep or very deep Ebal soils are on backslopes. The well drained, deep or very deep Wellston soils are on backslopes."
