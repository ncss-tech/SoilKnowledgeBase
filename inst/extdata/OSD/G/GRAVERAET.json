  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 51 to 152 centimeters. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 30 to 61 centimeters. Depth to carbonates is greater than 61 centimeters. The solum is extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part and slightly acid to neutral in the lower part and the C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent and the cobble content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons and from 0 to 20 percent, throughout the remainder of the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Textures of the A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures of the B horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe E part of the (E/B)x and (B/E)x horizons has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy sand. The Bt part of the (E/B)x and (B/E)x horizons has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Some pedons have Ex, Btx, or Bt horizons with colors and textures similar to the E and B portions of the fragipan horizons, respectively. The fragipan horizons are very hard or extremely hard when dry and firm to extremely firm when moist. Faint to distinct redoximorphic features are in the upper part of the fragipan in many pedons as a result of impeded drainage.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Munising series. Steuben soils need to be reclassified and will compete in the future. The Munising soils are very strongly to moderately acid at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters. The Steuben soils have more than 85 percent sand and less than 15 percent silt and clay in the C horizons within a depth of 102 centimeters. The closely related Argonne, Gogebic, Kallio, Wabeno and Wakefield soils are in the superactive clay activity class. In addition, these soils do not have free carbonates within their series control sections and have reaction more acid than slightly alkaline in their substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Graveraet soils are on ground moraines, end moraines and drumlins of Wisconsinan Age. They have formed in loamy glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone, shale, and limestone deposits. The Graveraet soils appear to have been further influenced by lacustrine and aeolian activity. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 910 millimeters, and mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Alcona and the moderately well drained Munising soils, the somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska, somewhat poorly drained Misery and poorly drained Gay soils. The Alcona and Kalkaska soils are on adjacent lacustrine and outwash deposits and the Munising soils are on similar landscape positions. The Misery soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Graveraet soils. The Gay soils are in depressions and drainageways."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The representative depth to perched wet soil moisture status ranges from 30 to 46 centimeters below the surface during the months of March, April, May, October, and November. Surface runoff is negligible to high, dependent on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately slow in the lower part of the pedon."
