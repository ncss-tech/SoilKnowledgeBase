  "OVERVIEW": "The Graveraet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines, end moraines and drumlins. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate high or high in the upper part, low or moderately low in the fragipan, and moderately high or high in the lower part of the pedon. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Depth to carbonates is greater than 61 centimeters. The solum is extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part and slightly acid to neutral in the lower part and the C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent and the cobble content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons and from 0 to 20 percent, throughout the remainder of the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Textures of the A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.

Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy sand. The Bt part of the (E/B)x and (B/E)x horizons has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Some pedons have Ex, Btx, or Bt horizons with colors and textures similar to the E and B portions of the fragipan horizons, respectively. The fragipan horizons are very hard or extremely hard when dry and firm to extremely firm when moist. Faint to distinct redoximorphic features are in the upper part of the fragipan in many pedons as a result of impeded drainage.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Munising series. Steuben soils need to be reclassified and will compete in the future. The Munising soils are very strongly to moderately acid at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters. The Steuben soils have more than 85 percent sand and less than 15 percent silt and clay in the C horizons within a depth of 102 centimeters. The closely related Argonne, Gogebic, Kallio, Wabeno and Wakefield soils are in the superactive clay activity class. In addition, these soils do not have free carbonates within their series control sections and have reaction more acid than slightly alkaline in their substratum."

Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 910 millimeters, and mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C."

The Alcona and Kalkaska soils are on adjacent lacustrine and outwash deposits and the Munising soils are on similar landscape positions. The Misery soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Graveraet soils. The Gay soils are in depressions and drainageways."
