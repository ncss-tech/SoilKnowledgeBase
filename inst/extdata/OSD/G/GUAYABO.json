  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guayabo series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on coastal plains of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in sandy marine deposits.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
