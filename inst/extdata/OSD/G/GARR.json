  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of sola and depth to bedrock range from 12 to 20 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The soil is usually dry for 6 months or more during most years, mainly during the spring, summer and autumn months.  The soil has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.8).  The control section is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or light loam modified by gravel, cobbles or stones.  Rock fragments range from 60 to 85 percent.  The upper 15 inches of the profile average less than 0.3 percent organic matter.  Few or common, fine to coarse lime segregations occur in the horizon immediately above bedrock, or the rock is coated by lime in cracks and on its surface, or both."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Garr soils are on moderately steep and steep foothills and mountain slopes at elevations of 2,000 to 3,500 feet.  Slope gradients are 15 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from metamorphic rocks including gneiss or schist.  The climate is hot and arid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 4 to 8 inches and mean annual temperature of about 60 degrees to 66 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., July 86 degrees F., and average frost-free season is about 200 to 240 days."

Cave soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Pulsipher soils have mean annual temperature of <59 degrees F., and are Xerollic.  St. Thomas soils lack cambic horizons and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Virgin Peak soils have mollic epipedons and have mean annual temperatures of <59 degrees F."
