  "OVERVIEW": "The Grays series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils than formed in loess or other silty material and calcareous stratified sediments. These soils are on terraces, lake plains, and outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
