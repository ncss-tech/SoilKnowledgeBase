  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodson series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium or loess and the underlying residuum weathered from shale or interbedded shale and siltstone on upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",
