Losantville soils have free carbonates at a depth of 8 to 20 inches and are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Miamian soils are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches. Morrisville soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Shircliff soils are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have free carbonates from 30 to 60 inches. Skrainka soils do not have mollic colors in the surface layer and are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Useful soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The soils formed in colliuvium or loess and the underlying residuum from shale or interbedded shale and siltstone.  Chert fragments are commonly a part of the colluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

Bona soils are clayey-skeletal, are very deep to a lithic or paralithic contact and are on ridgetops and side slopes above the Goodson soils.  Alsup soils have a light colored surface layer and are on similar positions to the Goodson soils. Creldon and Hoberg soils have a fragipan and are on more level areas above the Goodson soils.  Ocie soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey and are on side slopes below the Goodson soils.  Viraton soils are fine-loamy, have a fragipan and are below the Goodson soils on broad level areas."
