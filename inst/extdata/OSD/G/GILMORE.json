  "REVDATE": "12/2004",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilmore series consists of very shallow and shallow soils formed in silty micaceous loess overlying weathered schist bedrock.  Gilmore soils are on hillsides, mountainsides, and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 34 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to skeletal material ranges from 4 to 16 inches below the mineral surface, and grades to weathered bedrock within 20 inches.  Texture of the fine earth part of the control section is silt loam or silt and coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The soil contains substantial amounts of mica and the coarse fragments are dominantly schist channers.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  The organic materials are slightly or moderately decomposed. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist from 2 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 3 to 6.  Strata of silt loam and silty clay loam are present in some pedons and vary from about 2 to 12 mm thick.  Strata tend to be roughly horizontal but commonly merge and divide in an irregular pattern.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC or 2C horizon has matrix hue from 10 YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 6; and chroma moist from 3 to 6."

The bedrock is highly fractured but grades into consolidated bedrock with depth.  The climate is cold continental.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 28 degrees F."
