    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F.  The difference between summer and mean winter temperatures is less than 40 degrees F. The soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry in all parts from April 1 until January 1 and is moist in some or all parts for only 60 to 90 consecutive days from January through March.   Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent.  These soils are typically effervescent below a depth of 10 inches and some pedons are effervescent throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 8/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 4/4. It is loam or, silt loam.  Clay percentage is 10 to 18.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Effervescence ranges from noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.  The sodium adsorption ratio is 1 to 25.  Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 decisiemens per meter.  Some pedons lack an E horizon.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 2.5Y 5/2,6/2, 6/4 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 2.5Y 3/2, 5/2 or 5/4. It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Clay percentage is 20 to 35.  Structure is prismatic or columnar in the upper part and may be blocky in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Carbonates are 0 to 5 percent. The sodium adsorption ratio is 13 to 100.  Electrical conductivity is 8 to 16 decisiemens per meter.  Some pedons have few to common filaments and veins of gypsum.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  Textures are stratified sandy loam to clay loam.   Some pedons have a brittle layer or weakly to moderately silica and lime cemented soil material that does not meet the requirements of a duripan at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons have a lithologic discontinuity within this horizon, and this horizon is absent in some pedons."

Casaga soils have a strong varnished desert pavement with a very gravelly A horizon and C horizons with 30 to 75 percent gravel.  Corum soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered granitic rock. Gothard soils are moist for 30 to 40 days in the summer and are moderately well drained. Leuhman and Polvadero soils have calcic horizons. Norob soils are moderately well drained, have soil temperatures less than 47 degrees F. and have mean summer and winter soil temperatures differences of more than 40 degrees F."
