  "OVERVIEW": "The Garces series consists of very deep, well drained saline-sodic soils that formed in granitic alluvium. Garces soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, and basin rims and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry in all parts from April 1 until January 1 and is moist in some or all parts for only 60 to 90 consecutive days from January through March.   Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent.  These soils are typically effervescent below a depth of 10 inches and some pedons are effervescent throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 8/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 4/4. It is loam or, silt loam.  Clay percentage is 10 to 18.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Effervescence ranges from noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.  The sodium adsorption ratio is 1 to 25.  Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 decisiemens per meter.  Some pedons lack an E horizon.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 2.5Y 5/2,6/2, 6/4 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 2.5Y 3/2, 5/2 or 5/4. It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Clay percentage is 20 to 35.  Structure is prismatic or columnar in the upper part and may be blocky in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Carbonates are 0 to 5 percent. The sodium adsorption ratio is 13 to 100.  Electrical conductivity is 8 to 16 decisiemens per meter.  Some pedons have few to common filaments and veins of gypsum.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  Textures are stratified sandy loam to clay loam.   Some pedons have a brittle layer or weakly to moderately silica and lime cemented soil material that does not meet the requirements of a duripan at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons have a lithologic discontinuity within this horizon, and this horizon is absent in some pedons."
