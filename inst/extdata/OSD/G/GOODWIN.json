The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has less than 18 percent clay and averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 35 percent are cobbles and stones. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam or sandy loam and averages more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. It is loam or sandy loam and averages 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones."
