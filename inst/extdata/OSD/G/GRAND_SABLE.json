Wamduska series average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Boscawen, Emmert, Stonelake and Yellowdog series are in the sandy-skeletal family and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grand Sable soils are on kame terraces adjacent to the Grand Sable Dunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. These soils formed in sandy outwash that was overlain by an eolian mantle from windblown fine sediments from the adjacent Grand Sable Dunes. Elevation ranges from 213 to 259 meters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 910 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 120 to 140 days."

The excessively drained Shelldrake soils are on the adjacent Grand Sable Dunes. The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska and Stutts soils occur on nearby outwash plains. The poorly drained Gongeau, somewhat poorly drained Towes and the poorly drained Rhody soils are in depressions and drainageways on adjacent sandstone benches."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested with northern hardwoods. Common tree species include sugar maple, American beech, paper birch, and black cherry. Ground plants include sweet cicely, yellow, Canadian, and downy violets, white baneberry, sharp-lobed hepatica, spinulose shield fern, wild sarsaparilla, and shining club moss. Some small idle areas near Grand Marais were previously cleared and cultivated for cropland and orchards."
