  "OVERVIEW": "The Grand Sable series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits overlying buried soils that formed in sandy outwash. These soils are on kame terraces adjacent to dunes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high over high and very high. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
