  "OVERVIEW": "The Guffey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and granite.  Guffey soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
