These soils are formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and granite, commonly of the Pikes Peak  Formation.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 25 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 95 days.  Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 10,900 feet."
