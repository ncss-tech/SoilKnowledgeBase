    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise stated depth ranges in this paragraph are measured from the mineral surface. Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 55 inches.    Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile. Stones covering the surface range from less than 0.01 to 0.1 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR ; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, the Ap horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A and E horizons are dominantly silt loam but include very fine sandy loam and loamy very fine sand. Reaction of the A and E horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have Bhs horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3. The Bs horizon, or Bs1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 4.  Some pedons have Bs2 horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. The Bhs and Bs horizons range from very strongly acid to moderately acid, and the Bs2 horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Some pedons have E/B or B/E horizons or both.  Reaction of the E', E/B or B/e horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons with B/E horizons do not have Bt horizons. Reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon ranges to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but in some pedons it ranges to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons are stratified with thin strata of very fine sand or fine sand.  The C horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Assinins, Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, Richter, Riggsville, and Zeba series in the same family.  Assinins and Riggsville soils have sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand textures in the upper 20 inches of the solum.  Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, and Richter, soils formed in calcareous materials and contain free carbonates within 60 inches.  In addition, Belding soils contain more than 28 percent clay in the argillic and 2C horizons.  Zeba soils have bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches."
