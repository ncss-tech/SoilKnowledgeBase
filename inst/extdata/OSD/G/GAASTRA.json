  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaastra series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty and loamy glaciofluvial deposits on ground moraines, and glacial lake basins.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percents.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile. Stones covering the surface range from less than 0.01 to 0.1 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR ; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, the Ap horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A and E horizons are dominantly silt loam but include very fine sandy loam and loamy very fine sand. Reaction of the A and E horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have Bhs horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3.
