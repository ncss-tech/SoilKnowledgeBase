  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gates series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loess, reworked alluvium, or reworked residual material.  These soils are on uplands, valley side slopes and older stream terraces.  They have slopes ranging from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Similar series in other families are the Colby, Coly, Crofton, Hersh, Ida, Kenesaw, Keota, Lowry, Mitchell, Nevee, Sully, Uly, and Ulysses soils.  Colby, Keota, Mitchell, and Nevee soils are dry for a longer period of time. Coly and Crofton have fine-silty textures and are calcareous throughout the profile.  Ida soils are dry for a shorter period of time.   Hersh soils are coarse-loamy.  Kenesaw, Lowry, Uly, and Ulysses soils have mollic epipedons.  The closely related Sully soil is calcareous throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gates soils occur on stream terraces, valley side slopes and on dissected uplands.  They are in transition areas between large areas of sandhills and the loess hills and table lands. Slope gradients are typically 2 to 11 percent, but range from 0 to 60 percent.   Gates soils formed in loess, reworked alluvium that lacks stratification, or reworked residual material.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

Anselmo and Hersh soils are in similar landscapes as Gates but have a coarse-loamy control section, and Anselmo soils have a mollic epipedon.  Kenesaw soils occupy lower positions in the landscape and have a mollic epipedon.  Valentine soils are on nearly level to hilly sandhills and have a sandy control section."
