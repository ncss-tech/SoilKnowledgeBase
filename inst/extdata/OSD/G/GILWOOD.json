All these series, except Cardova, Drapermill, and Milldraper soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) to bedrock. Cardova and Milldraper soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches. Drapermill soils have rock fragments of quartz and phyllite lithology."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gilwood soils are on moderately sloping shoulders to very steep backslopes of hills and knobs. Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent. They formed in residuum from siltstone. The bedrock is from the upper part of the Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group, in Indiana. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 114 cm (40 to 45 inches). Frost free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 105 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet)."

The moderately deep, more channery Brownstown soils are typically on backslopes. The well drained, moderately deep Gnawbone soils are on lower lying shoulders and backslopes, and have a paralithic contact. The deep and very deep, moderately well drained Spickert soils are on summits and shoulders. The well drained, deep Wellrock soils are on lower lying shoulders and backslopes, and have a paralithic contact. The well drained, deep Wrays soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes."
