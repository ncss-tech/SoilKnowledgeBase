The series control section does not have rock fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon has colors and textures similar to the E and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. A hue of 2.5Y occurs in the lower part of some pedons. It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. It commonly has redoximorphic features in the lower part.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or convex slopes on glacial lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in calcareous, clayey and silty lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsin Age. These sediments are primarily derived from the Des Moines lobe.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. Frost free days range from 90 to 140. Elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 500 meters."
