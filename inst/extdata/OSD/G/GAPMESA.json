  "OVERVIEW": "The Gapmesa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone. Gapmesa soils are on cuestas, hills, ridges, and mesas. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Gaddes and Yenlo series.  A potential competitor still classified in the Ustollic subgroup is the Harbord series.  Balon, Blancot, Buckle, Cambria, Decolney, Doakum, Fort, Harbord, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Palacid, Penistaja, Pokeman, Potts, Quagwa, Redpen, Sundance, Teckla, and Yenlo soils are very deep.  Bowbac and Spangler soils are moderately deep to argillaceous sandstone.  Cerrillos and Spenlo soils have calcic horizons and should be classified as Calciargids. Cushman and Pugsley soils are moderately deep to soft sandstone or shale.  Gapbutte and Pawspoc soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Gaddes soils are moderately deep to weathered granite.  Los Alamos soils are moderately deep to pumice and ash. In addition, the Bowbac, Cushman, Decolney, Fort, Hagerman, Harbord, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance and Tekla soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
