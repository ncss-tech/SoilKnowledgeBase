The particle-size control section is typically clay or silty clay with clay ranging from 40 to 55 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent and are dominately less than one and one-half inches in size but large channers and flaggy fragments also occur. Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches and the depth to the base of the Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 48 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through  3.  Textures are clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt and Bk horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures are clay or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. Textures are clay, clay loam or silty clay loam."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium mainly from sedimentary shale and limestone.  Elevation ranges from 8,300 to 10,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches with most being received as snow.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 42 degrees F."
