  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gourley series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from interbedded shale and limestone.  These soils are on intermediate plateau levels, valley side slopes, small swales and toe slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section is typically clay or silty clay with clay ranging from 40 to 55 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent and are dominately less than one and one-half inches in size but large channers and flaggy fragments also occur. Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches and the depth to the base of the Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 48 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through  3.  Textures are clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt and Bk horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures are clay or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. Textures are clay, clay loam or silty clay loam."
