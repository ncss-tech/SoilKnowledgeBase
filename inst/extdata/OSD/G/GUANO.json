The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 25 percent rock fragments mainly as gravel, and 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragment content of 15 to 35 percent.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam, loam and clay loam.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 25 percent.  Clay content is 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline."
