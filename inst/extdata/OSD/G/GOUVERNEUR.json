  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 1 to 10 inches.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 3 to 20 percent by volume throughout the soil. The soil ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Many pedons have an A horizon in place of the Ap horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Some pedons have a few faint high chroma mottles.  Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure, and friable or very friable consistence.  Some pedons have a thin saprolitic C or BC horizon immediately overlying the bedrock.\nThe R horizon has bedrock that is dominantly limestone, marble or dolomitic sandstone."

Insula and Summerville soils are shallow to bedrock.  St. Ignace soils are contain free lime.  Quetico soils are acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gouverneur soils are on smooth bedrock controlled landforms that contain both low escarpments and level areas of exposed bedrock.  The slope gradient commonly is 0 to 4 percent, but the full range is 0 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in a thin layer of glacial till overlying limestone, dolomitic limestone or marble bedrock.  In some areas of marble bedrock the soil formed in residuum.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches; the mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.; and the mean annual frost-free days ranges from 120 to 150.  The elevation ranges from 300 to 600 feet above sea level."

The Grenville and Hogansburg soils are very deep to bedrock and are chiefly on steplike sideslopes that punctuate the landscape in places.  The Summerville soils and the moderately deep to bedrock Nehasne soils contain cambic horizons.  The shallow Ruse and moderately deep Ogdensburg soils occur in shallow basins and have mollic epipedons and aquic moisture regimes."
