The soils formed in alluvial and colluvial deposits derived from red sandstone and calcareous shale. Annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches with a summer maximum. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."

In the past, the Gilland type location was thought to be mesic instead of thermic.  Since Gilland has not been used in any other survey, and since the original WSMR line work was never digitized, it has been reclassified to be Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids.  The type location now resides in a solidly thermic area around Mockingbird Gap.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
