  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilland series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in alluvial and colluvial deposits derived from red sandstone and calcareous shale on rolling hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

In the past, the Gilland type location was thought to be mesic instead of thermic.  Since Gilland has not been used in any other survey, and since the original WSMR line work was never digitized, it has been reclassified to be Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids.  The type location now resides in a solidly thermic area around Mockingbird Gap."
