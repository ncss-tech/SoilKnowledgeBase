  "OVERVIEW": "The Guemes series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, residuum and glacial till high in serpentine.  These soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
