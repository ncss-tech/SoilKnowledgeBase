    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. at any time for more than a few days all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and usually is moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments range from less than 1 to 25 percent in the A and B horizons.  Coarse and very coarse sand average more than 20 percent.\nThe A horizon is pale brown, light brownish gray, grayish brown, brown, light yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown, yellowish brown, pinkish gray or light brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4).  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or gravelly equivalents of each.  This horizon contains less than 1 percent organic matter in all parts.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The lower boundary is gradual or clear.\nThe B2t horizon is pale brown , brown, light brown, light gray, light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown, grayish brown, reddish yellow, pink or brownish yellow (10YR 6/1, 6/3, 5/3, 6/4, 6/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 4/4, 4/6, 7/4, 7/6, 5/2; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4, 6/4, 6/6, or 7/4).  It is heavy sandy loam, heavy fine sandy loam, or gravelly equivalents of each and has 3 to 6 percent more clay than the A horizon.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is light yellowish brown, very pale brown, yellowish brown, pale brown, light brownish yellow (10YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/3, 6/2, 6/6, 6/8, 7/3, 7/4, 4/2, 4/4) or brown (7.5YR 4/4, 4/2).  It is loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or gravelly equivalents of each.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have silica cementation or contrasting soil material or more than 35 percent gravel, all below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atwater and Dinuba series in the same family and the Hanford, Oakdale, Ramona, and Snelling series.  Atwater soils average less than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand, and are essentially gravel free.  Dinuba soils are calcareous between depths of 20 to 40 inches and have silty unrelated sediments below the argillic horizon.  Hanford soils lack an argillic horizon.  Oakdale soils have a moist value of 3 and more than 1.2 percent organic matter to a depth of more than 4 inches.  Ramona and Snelling soils have more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenfield soils are on fans and terraces at elevations of 100 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse and coarse textured alluvium or some wind deposited material derived from granitic and mixed sources.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is 76 to 80 degrees F.  The frost free season averages about 200 to 325 days."

Arlington and San Joaquin soils have duripans at depths of less than 40 inches.  Docas soils lack argillic horizons.  Garey soils have an argillic horizon consisting of lamellae and intervening sandy layers without clay bridges.  Lockwood soils have a mollic epipedon."
