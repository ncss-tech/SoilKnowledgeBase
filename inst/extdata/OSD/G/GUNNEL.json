  "OVERVIEW": "The Gunnel series consists of shallow, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium. They are on fan terraces and have slopes of 4 to 12 percent. The average annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 250 mm.",
