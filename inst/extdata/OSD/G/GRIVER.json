  "OVERVIEW": "The Griver series consists of very deep, poorly or somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Griver soils are on floodplains and relict levees. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Saline and alkali phases are recognized.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 0 to 35 percent.\nA horizon\nValue: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.\nStructure: massive or weak or moderate very thin to medium platy structure.\nC horizons\nValue: 3 to 6, moist and 4 to 7 dry.\nChroma: 2 or 3.\nTexture: Stratified silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand.  Some pedons contain thin strata of contrasting finer textures or gravelly sand.  Textures normally become coarser with depth but some areas have strata of dense unconforming clay below 100 cm.\nRedox features: Few to many masses of iron depletions or concentrations are present at depths between 50 and 90 cm."
