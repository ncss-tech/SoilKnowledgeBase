  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Soil is saturated at depths of 50 to 100 cm during the spring runoff in most years; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and remains constant with depth, but may vary erratically with strata of different texture.\nEffervescence: Very slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.\nOther features: One or more buried A horizons are common. Saline and alkali phases are recognized.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 0 to 35 percent.\nA horizon\nValue: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.\nStructure: massive or weak or moderate very thin to medium platy structure.\nC horizons\nValue: 3 to 6, moist and 4 to 7 dry.\nChroma: 2 or 3.\nTexture: Stratified silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand.  Some pedons contain thin strata of contrasting finer textures or gravelly sand.  Textures normally become coarser with depth but some areas have strata of dense unconforming clay below 100 cm.\nRedox features: Few to many masses of iron depletions or concentrations are present at depths between 50 and 90 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Griver soils are on flood plains and relict levees at elevations of 1,370 to 1,620 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is cool and semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C; and the frost-free season is about l00 to 140 days."

Water tables are at depths of 50 to 100 cm during the spring runoff in most years.  Some areas have been partially drained.  These drained phases commonly have a water table between 100 and 150 cm during the spring months in most years.  The soils are subject to rare to frequent overflow."
