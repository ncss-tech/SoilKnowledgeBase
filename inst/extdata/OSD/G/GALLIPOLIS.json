  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to 80 inches. Rock fragments are commonly absent but range up to 2 percent in the Ap, A, and E horizons and up to 5 percent in the Bt, BC, and C horizons. They are mainly waterworn fine sandstone or quartzite.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 to 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral to strongly acid. Some uncultivated pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick and an E horizon 3 to 8 inches thick. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 3 to 6; and iron depletions (chroma of 2 or less) below the upper 10 inches. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam and less commonly loam in the lower part with a high percentage of very fine sand. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Some pedons have slight or moderate brittleness (Btx horizon) in the lower part of the Bt. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam and less commonly loam. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam but some pedons have lenses of loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid to a depth of 60 inches but moderately acid is permitted below 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashburn, Blocher, Deuchars, Percell, Stonehead, and tentative Tarhollow series, with other series possibly added once they are updated to the Eighth Edition of Soil Taxonomy. Ashburn soils developed in reworked alluvium, and have a lithic contact in the series control section. Blocher soils formed in glacial till with an overlying mantle of loess. Deuchars soils are formed in loess or silty colluvial materials underlain by shale and thin bands of sandstone. Percell soils have carbonates in the series control section. Stonehead soils have more clay in the lower part of the solum and are underlain by bedrock. Tarhollow soils developed in a loess mantle 24 to 40 inches thick, with underlying residuum of siltstone, sandstone, and limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gallipolis soils are on old stream terraces, mainly along the Ohio River and its major tributaries. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 15 percent but range to 25 percent. They formed mainly in acid silty old alluvium and in places an underlying lacustrine material or loamy alluvium. Flooding frequency is rare to none. The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 51 to 56 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elkinsville ,Elk, Ginat, Licking, Peoga, Taggart and Wheeling soils. Elkinsville, Elk,and Wheeling soils are well drained, have browner subsoils, and typically are on higher topographic positions or more sloping, dissected areas along drainageways. The moderately well drained Licking soils have more clay in the subsoil, and are on similar topographic positions. The poorly drained Ginat and Peoga soils and the somewhat poorly drained Taggart soils have grayer subsoils, and are on lower topographic positions."
