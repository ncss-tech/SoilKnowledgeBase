The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 cumulative days after July 1.  Exchangeable sodium is greater than 15 percent and the SAR ranges from 30 to 200 below the surface layer.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.

Absher, Creed, and Elloam soils have consistent gypsum horizons and salts more soluble than gypsum.  Abston and Weingart soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Gerdrum soils have horizons containing gypsum at 10 to 28 inches and have SAR values of 13 to 30.  Loburn soils are moderately to slightly acid in the upper 14 inches.  Oburn soils have very gravelly sandy loam at 20 to 40 inches.  Thoeny soils have a consistent gypsum horizon at 24 to 36 inches and lack a very strongly alkaline soil reaction.  Spicerton soils have mean summer soil temperature lower than 59 degrees F.  Obadia soils lack a very strongly alkaline soil reaction in the pedon."
