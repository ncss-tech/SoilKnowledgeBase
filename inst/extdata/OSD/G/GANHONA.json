  "OVERVIEW": "The Ganhona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin loess mantle over stratified loamy alluvium.  Ganhona soils are on dissected stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

The organic mat ranges form 2 to 7 inches thick.  Reaction in the solum ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon (when present) has value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has hue moist of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value moist of 3, or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizons have hue moist of 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is stratified fine sandy loam, silt loam and sand."
