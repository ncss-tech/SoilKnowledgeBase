The organic mat ranges form 2 to 7 inches thick.  Reaction in the solum ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon (when present) has value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has hue moist of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value moist of 3, or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizons have hue moist of 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is stratified fine sandy loam, silt loam and sand."

The Kalambach and Steese soils have substrata with more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Steese soils also have bedrock at from 20 to 40 inches.  Eska, Mine, Sambrito, Southpaw, Tsana, and Tebay soils lack stratified substrata."

These soils formed in a thin silty loess mantle over stratified loamy alluvium.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  Elevation ranges from 2400 to 2750 feet."
