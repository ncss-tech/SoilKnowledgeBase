The soil is usually moist and is dry between 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. It is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  Depth to redox depletions with chroma of less than 2 is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist,3 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Hard rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soft tuff fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btg  horizons have matrix hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR moist and 2.5Y or 5Y dry, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Redox concentrations have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.   It is clay or silty clay averaging 40 to 55 percent clay.  Soft tuff fragments range from 0 to 25 percent.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid."

(A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from approximately 7 to 60  inches.  (Bw, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 and Btg5 horizons)\nAquic feature - the zone from 16 to 36 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons) having redox depletions with color value of 4 and chroma of 2 with redox concentrations (Btg2 horizon).  Aquic conditions are present for some time in most years.\nMixed mineralogy -  presumed to be mixed by previous field experience.\nEpisaturation assumed\nPale feature - the zone from 0 to 60 inches having no clay decrease by 20 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
