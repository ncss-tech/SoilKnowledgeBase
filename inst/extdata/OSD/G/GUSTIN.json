  "OVERVIEW": "The Gustin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and moderately well drained soils on foot slopes, benches and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from ash-flow tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

(A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from approximately 7 to 60  inches.  (Bw, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 and Btg5 horizons)\nAquic feature - the zone from 16 to 36 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons) having redox depletions with color value of 4 and chroma of 2 with redox concentrations (Btg2 horizon).  Aquic conditions are present for some time in most years.\nMixed mineralogy -  presumed to be mixed by previous field experience.\nEpisaturation assumed\nPale feature - the zone from 0 to 60 inches having no clay decrease by 20 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
