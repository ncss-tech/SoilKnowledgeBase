  "OVERVIEW": "The Gillingham series consists of well drained soils deep to sandstone bedrock.  These upland soils formed in eolian sands, loamy slope alluvium, and in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Permeability is rapid in the eolian sand, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy slope alluvium and in the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 6 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees.",
