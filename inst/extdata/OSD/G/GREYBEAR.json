  "OVERVIEW": "The Greybear series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium over residuum. These soils are on sedimentary plains, depressions and intermontane basins. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
