Although the soils consist of fluvial material, the sand and rock fragments in the lower part are thought to be void of the organic carbon needed to meet the criteria for the fluventic subgroup. Rapid streamflow has removed volcanic glass from the fluvial material.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
