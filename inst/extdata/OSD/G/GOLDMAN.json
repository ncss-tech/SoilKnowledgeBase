Other similar soils are Askew, Beulah, Center, Commerce, Convent, Dubbs, Dundee, Pelahatchie, Sterlington, and Tutwiler series. Askew, Center, Dubbs, Dundee, and Pelahatchie soils have a fine-silty argillic horizon. Beulah, Commerce, and Convent soils do not have an argillic horizon. Dubbs, Sterlington, and Tutwiler soils do not have aquic conditions and iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."

Slopes are convex and range in gradient from 1 to 5 percent. The soil formed in alkaline Mississippi River alluvium with mixed mineralogy. Mean annual rainfall is 52 inches, and mean annual temperature about 66 degrees F.. Average January temperature is 49 degrees F., and average July temperature 82 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location pedon was moved to a different location in Tensas Parish in 2002, and the series was assigned to an active activity class.  The series was updated in 2004 to allow texture of loamy fine sand in the BC horizon, and fine sand in the C horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon-----0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon----5 to 18 inches (Bt horizos)\nAquic conditions----saturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features, including iron depletions with chroma 2 at 11 to 18 inches deep (Bt2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
