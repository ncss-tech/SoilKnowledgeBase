  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodtack series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt or tuff-breccia. Goodtack soils are on lava plateaus and hills. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
