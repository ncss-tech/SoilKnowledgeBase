  "OVERVIEW": "The Getchell series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium, over dense glacial till. Getchell soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 2159 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The units were changed to metric and the format was changed to tabular. Future evaluation needs to be made as to whether or not this soil should be a Spodosol or Andisol. The distribution of soils with and albic horizons needs to be clarified. The nature of cementation in the upper part of the dense glacial till needs to be investigated.  Dry days of 45 to 60 added based on OSD's spatially used adjacent to Getchell.\n04/1994: Classification only changed because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy. Fails criteria for spodic because of lack of an albic horizon. Characterization soil sample number S74WA61-2, 4-306-4-313, 84P3814-3816, and 78P0944-78P0945. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a cambic horizon from 2 to 20 inches, and a cemented layer at 36 inches.\n________________________________________"
