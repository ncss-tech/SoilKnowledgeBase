  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldbluffs series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. Goldbluffs soils are on narrow ridges on hillslopes and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).
