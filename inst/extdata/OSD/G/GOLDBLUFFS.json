  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldbluffs soils occur on narrow ridges on hillslopes. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6 to 309 meters (15 to 1010 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 280 to 325 days."
