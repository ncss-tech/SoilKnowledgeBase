  "REVDATE": "05/2000",
  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenpool series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandy wind blown deposits of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on smooth undulating or hummocky, slopes of terraces or on side slopes of terraces where the wind blown material has masked one or more terraces.  They occur in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.",

Some pedons do not have a continuous Bt in the upper argillic horizon but the combined thickness of lamellae is more than 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe E part of the E/Bt horizons (E horizon) has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt part of the E/Bt horizons (Bt horizon) has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  This horizon occurs as lamellae up to 1 inch thick and from about 1 to 16 inches apart.  Some pedons have skeletans in the E/Bt horizon that make up less than 5 percent by volume."
