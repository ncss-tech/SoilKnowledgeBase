  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Combined thickness of the A horizon and E horizon range from 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons do not have a continuous Bt in the upper argillic horizon but the combined thickness of lamellae is more than 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe E part of the E/Bt horizons (E horizon) has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt part of the E/Bt horizons (Bt horizon) has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  This horizon occurs as lamellae up to 1 inch thick and from about 1 to 16 inches apart.  Some pedons have skeletans in the E/Bt horizon that make up less than 5 percent by volume."
