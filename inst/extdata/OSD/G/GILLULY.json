(Bt and Btk  horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 31 cm.  (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 62 cm.  (Bt and Btk horizons)\nSecondary carbonate accumulations:  in the zone from 46 to 73 cm (Btk and Bk horizons)\nLithic contact:  The contact with interbedded limestone, sandstone and shale at 73 cm.  (R horizon)\nThe Btk and Bk horizon do not qualify as a calcic horizon due either to insufficient thickness or carbonate equivalent.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
