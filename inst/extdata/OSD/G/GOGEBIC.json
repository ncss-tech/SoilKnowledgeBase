    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  The loamy eolian mantle ranges from 15 to 28 inches thick. The solum thickness ranges from about 30 to greater than 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section and the argillic horizon average between 2 and 18 percent clay and between 52 and 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  The reaction of the solum ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid and the C horizons are strongly acid to slightly acid. Rock fragments in the series control section average more than 10 percent.  Gravel content averages from 5 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and fragipan and from 5 to 30 percent in the C horizon. Cobble content averages from 1 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and from 5 to 20 percent in the fragipan and C horizon.  Stones average 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Redox features occur below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches and saturation occurs there for some time in most years.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have Oa horizons up to 2 inches thick with similar colors.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. In cultivated areas there is an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2.  The A or Ap is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nSome pedon have Bhs horizons with value and chroma of 3. The Bs1 and Bs2 horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bs3 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The Bs horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of the textures.\nFragipan horizons are the 2Ex, 2(E/B)x, 2(B/E)x, or 2Btx; and are 6 to 28 inches thick. These horizons occur both above and below the contact between the loamy cap and the sandy loam till. One or more of the above fragipan horizons may occur in a pedon.\nThe 2Ex horizon and the Ex portion the 2(E/B)x or 2(B/E)x horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The 2Btx portion of the 2(E/B)x  or 2(B/E)x horizons has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Textures of the fragipan horizons are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. The fragipan horizons have moderate or strong coarse or medium platy structure.\nSome pedons have a 2Btx horizon with color and texture like the 2Btx portion described above.\nSome pedons have 2B/E horizons.  The 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or the gravelly and very gravelly analogues of these textures.  Clay content of the Bt horizon averages 8 to 22 percent. The 2Bt horizon has moderate to strong, and coarse to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. The 2C horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Textures are predominantly sand, loamy sand or the gravelly or very gravelly  analogues of these textures. Pockets of loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam are in some pedons. Some pedons do not have sandy 3C horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Argonne, Champion, Graveraet, Kallio, Munising, Stuben(T), Wabeno and Wakefield series.  Argonne and Wabeno soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Champion soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Graveraet soils have free carbonates within 40 inches. Kallio soils contain up to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon and substratum. Munising soils do not have modified eolian mantles and developed in till derived mainly from red sandstone and have less than 10 percent rock fragments. Stuben soils have sandy substratums at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  Wakefield soils contain less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section and have 18 or more percent clay in the argillic horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS: A new series is need for soils formerly mapped as the well drained phase of this series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nalbic horizon - 3 to 6 inches (E); spodic horizon - 6 to 21 inches (Bs1, Bs2, Bs3); fragipan - 25 to 44 inches 2Ex, 2E/Bx; glossic horizon - 37 to 44 inches 2E/Bx; argillic horizon - 44 to 56 inches 2Bt; oxyaquic feature - redox features and saturation below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches. The loamy eolian mantle has been modified by wind throw action and post glacial erosion.\nADDITIONAL DATA - For laboratory data on this pedon see pedon no.
