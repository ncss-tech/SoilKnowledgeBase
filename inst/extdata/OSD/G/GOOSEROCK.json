  "OVERVIEW": "The Gooserock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in tuffaceous colluvium and residuum overlain by reworked loess and ash.  They are north-facing slopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
