  "OVERVIEW": "The Gatewall series consists of moderately deep to dense till, well drained soils formed in compact glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on toeslopes, footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Thickness of the volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to compact till ranges from 20 to 30 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.

Phillcher soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 35 to 38 degrees F and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days.  Holloway soils are loams and silt loams throughout.  Hun soils are loamy sand or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction of the 2C horizon.  Myerscreek soils have 2 to 6 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Petty soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Rumsey soils are over 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Finney and Surgh soils lack a 2Cd horizon and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Waldbillig soils have lamellae and a very hard 2E and Bt horizon."
