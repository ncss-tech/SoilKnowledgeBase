These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to compact till ranges from 20 to 30 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent pebbles and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Cd horizons have hues of 7.5YR, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 40 percent pebbles and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Cd horizon has hues of 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.

The Buhrig, Devore, Otwin and Venson soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact.  The Moses and Prouty soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact.  Phillcher soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 35 to 38 degrees F and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days.  Holloway soils are loams and silt loams throughout.  Hun soils are loamy sand or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction of the 2C horizon.  Myerscreek soils have 2 to 6 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Petty soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Rumsey soils are over 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Finney and Surgh soils lack a 2Cd horizon and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Waldbillig soils have lamellae and a very hard 2E and Bt horizon."

These soils formed in compact glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic sources with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 4,200 to 5,900 feet.  Precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.
