  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout, except where the Ap horizon has been limed. The effective CEC is 50 percent or more saturated with exchangeable aluminum in the control section to a depth of 30 inches or more. Exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 percent or more in some horizon at depths greater than 20 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations in shades of brown range from few to many. Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg and B'tg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Acadia, Acy, Cupco, Dundee, Essen, Galvez, Hebert, Kurk, McGehee, and Patoutville series are in closely related families. Cupco soils have dominant chroma 2 in the matrix and on faces of peds throughout the subsoil to 30 inches deep, and have less than 50 percent aluminum saturation in the upper part of the control section. All of the other closely related soils have less than 50 percent aluminum saturation in the upper part of the control section.  In addition, Acadia soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Acy, Dundee, Essen, Galvez, Hebert, Kurk, McGehee, and Patoutville soils all have mixed mineralogy. In addition, Acy, Essen, Galvez, and Patoutville soils  are less acid in the B horizon. Hebert and McGehee soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Groom soils formed in silty and loamy alluvial sediments of late Pleistocene age. They are on low stream terraces on major streams. The slope gradient commonly is less than 1 percent, but ranges to 2 percent. Climate is warm and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 64 to 68 degrees F. average annual precipitation ranges from about 48 to 52 inches."

Haggerty soils are coarse-loamy and are on lower lying positions on the same landscapes. Mollicy soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on low ridge positions on the same landscapes. Litro, Perry, and Portland soils are on slightly lower positions and have a clayey control section. Wrightsville soils have a clayey control section and are on similar positions."

These soils are rarely to frequently flooded by shallow water when streams overflow in winter and spring. An apparent saturated zone is at 0 to 1.5 feet below the surface during December through June in normal years."
