The soil between the depth of 6 to 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to May 15 and is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 35 to 40 percent clay.  Base saturation (sum) directly above the paralithic contact is less than 35 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4 or 4/4. Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 7/4 or 7/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 5/6, 5/4.  It is clay loam in the upper part of the B horizon and is clay or clay loam in the lower part of the B horizon.  Clay content ranges from 30 to 45 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 2 to 10 percent."
