Balon, Blancot, Buckle, Cambria, Decolney, Doakum, Forkwood, Fort, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Palacid, Penistaja, Potts, Quagwa, Redpen, Sundance, and Teckla soils are more than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Bowbac, Cushman, Pokeman, Pugsley, and Spangler series are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Gapbutte soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock. Gapmesa soils have mean annual air temperatures below 49 degrees F. Hagerman soils typically have redder hues, darker surface horizons with higher organic carbon, and have moisture patterns which receive slightly more precipitation during late spring and early summer. In addition Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Decolney, Forkwood, Fort, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Teckla and Yenlo soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gaddes soils are on pediment surfaces on undulating to steep areas of granite hills and mountains at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent but are generally less than 15 percent.  They formed in place on granite and related rocks.  The climate is continental, with a mean annual precipitation of 10 to 14 inches.  About one-half of the precipitation comes as rain during July and August and about one-third during December, January and February as rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 54 to 56 degrees F."
