  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grayhead series consist of deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from granite, granodiorite, granodiorite gneiss, or quartz monzonite.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
