  "OVERVIEW": "The Gillum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum weathered from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Gillum soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hillslopes in mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
