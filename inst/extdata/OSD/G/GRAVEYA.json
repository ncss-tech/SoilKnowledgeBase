  "OVERVIEW": "The Graveya series consist of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff, mixed in the lower part with lacustrine sediments.  Graveya soils are on foothills.  Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
