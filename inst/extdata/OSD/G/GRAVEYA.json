Minat soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F. and are slightly to moderately alkaline in the A and Bw horizons.  Nibbs soils have stratified sand and gravel at depths of 21 to 41 inches and are slightly or moderately alkaline in the A and Bw horizons.  Panlee soils are greater than 30 inches to lime.  Veet soils have a period of appreciable summer moisture for 10 to 20 days in the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Graveya soils are moderately steep on backslopes and footslopes of foothills at elevations of 2,400 to 3,600 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff, mixed in the lower part with lacustrine sediments.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 125 to 145 days."
