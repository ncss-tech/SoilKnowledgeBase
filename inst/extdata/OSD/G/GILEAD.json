Flakes of mica range from few to common in the B and C horizons.  Quartz pebbles or fragments of ironstone range from 0 to 18 percent by volume throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A and E horizons are loamy sand, sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Few to many mottles are present in the lower Bt horizon or it may be mottled with variegated colors.  It is sandy clay, clay, clay loam, or thin transitional layers of sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8, or it is neutral with value of 4 to 8. It may be mottled or contain mottled layers with both high and low chroma.  It is clay, silty clay, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sand, or gravelly sand."

Other competitors are Appling, Blaney, Cowarts, Cuthbert, Dogue, Duplin, Esto, Eulonia, Gritney, Hulett, Marlboro, Mayodan, Nankin, Pelion, Uchee, Varina, Vaucluse, and Wedowee series.  Hornsville soils are on smooth landscapes in the lower Southern Coastal Plain, have an apparent water table within 2.5 to 3.5 feet of the surface for 3 to 5 months in most years, and do not have flakes of mica in the argillic horizon.  Appling, Cuthbert, Hulett, Marlboro, Mayodan, Nankin, Varina, and Wedowee soils lack mottles in chroma of 2 or less within the control section.  In addition, Appling, Hulett, Mayodan, and Wedowee soils have saprolite beneath the solum.  Blaney and Uchee soils have arenic surfaces.  Cowarts, Pelion, and Vaucluse soils are fine-loamy. Cuthbert and Nankin soils have redder hue.  Dogue, Eulonia, and Gritney soils have mixed mineralogy.  Duplin soils have weaker structure in the upper part of the B2t horizon, have an apparent water table within 2 to 3 1/2 feet of the surface in wet periods, and lack a 20 percent decrease in clay from the maximum within 60 inches.  Esto soils lack a 20 percent decrease in clay from the maximum within 60 inches.  Varina soils are plinthic and Marlboro soils lack a 20 percent decrease in clay within 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gilead soils occur on highly dissected landscapes in the upper Coastal Plain.  Typically these soils are in the Carolina and Georgia Sandhills MLRA.  They occupy remnants of old stable surfaces, erosional surfaces, and to a lesser extent toe slopes.  The slope gradient commonly is 2 to 15 percent, but the range is 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in clayey Coastal Plain sediments.  The mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 47 inches near the type location."

Blanton soils have grossarenic surfaces.  Blanton, Dothan, Fuquay, and Lakeland soils generally occupy the higher, smoother parts of the landscape.  Dothan and Fuquay soils are plinthic, and in addition, Fuquay soils have arenic surfaces.  Lakeland soils are sandy.  Lillington soils are loamy-skeletal.  Norfolk and Orangeburg soils are fine-loamy.  Wagram soils have arenic surfaces."

This revision did not alter the concepts of the Gilead series; however, it does reflect a more accurate classification of the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon -the zone between depths of 5 and 52 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)\nMLRA's = 137, 133A"
