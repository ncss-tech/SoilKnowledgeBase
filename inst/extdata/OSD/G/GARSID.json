  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible for the subgroup and family in which the series has been placed applies to the series as well.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Weighted average gypsums content of the control section ranges from 0 to 5 percent and a majority of subhorizons above 20 should not exceed 3 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos in the control section except that subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness that exceed those limits may occur inconsistently in some pedons.  Continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate should not occur within the control section although some visible calcium carbonate and/or sulfate may occur inconsistently at any depth or may occur uniformly throughout the control section in some pedons as a natural feature of the parent material.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section.  Coarse fragments ranging from 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter predominate.  Volume of durinodes may range from 0 to 3 percent in the control section providing consistence is not brittle.  Mottling within the control section not due to segregated lime or gypsum may range from no mottling to a few faint mottles but if the soil is consistently mottled the base chroma of the matrix material must be more than 2.  The control section should be uniform with only minor stratification.  Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 7 dry or 3 to 6 moist, and in chroma from 1 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Hue of the C horizon ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Weighted\naverage calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from less than 1 to 10 percent.  Texture is usually a loam or clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent silt with more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Garsid series occurs on gently to very steeply sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range from about 2 percent to about 40 or more percent.  The soil is developing in moderately thin, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials weathered residually or very locally transported from sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 65 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F."
