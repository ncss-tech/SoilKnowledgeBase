  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gran soils are on pediments, hillslopes and mountain slopes and have gradients of 1 to 65 percent. They formed in alluvium-colluvium weathered from granite and to some extent from rhyolite, andesite, latite and diorite. Elevation is 1,800 to 4,000 feet. The climate is warm and semi-arid continental. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain. Mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 220 to 280 days."
