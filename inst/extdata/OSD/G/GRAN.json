  "OVERVIEW": "The Gran series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium-colluvium. Gran soils are on pediments, hillslopes and mountain slopes with gradients of 1 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

They formed in alluvium-colluvium weathered from granite and to some extent from rhyolite, andesite, latite and diorite. Elevation is 1,800 to 4,000 feet. The climate is warm and semi-arid continental. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain. Mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 220 to 280 days."
