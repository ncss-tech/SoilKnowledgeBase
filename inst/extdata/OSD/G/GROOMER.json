  "OVERVIEW": "The Groomer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from shale and siltstone.  Groomer soils are on mountain slopes and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches (585 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).",

(Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nOther features:  secondary carbonates from 50 to 66 inches (127 to 168 cm).\nRemarks: These soils were formerly mapped as Gothic in this area of Colorado.  Gothic soils do not have carbonates and are being restricted to the western part of the state.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
