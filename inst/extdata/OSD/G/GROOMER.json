(Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nOther features:  secondary carbonates from 50 to 66 inches (127 to 168 cm).\nRemarks: These soils were formerly mapped as Gothic in this area of Colorado.  Gothic soils do not have carbonates and are being restricted to the western part of the state.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
