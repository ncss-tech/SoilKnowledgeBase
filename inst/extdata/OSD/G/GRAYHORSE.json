  "OVERVIEW": "The Grayhorse series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces and inset fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",
