  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. Glenwood soils are on valley floors and river terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
