  "OVERVIEW": "The Gaia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived dominantly from quartzite with local admixtures of granitic rocks.  Gaia soils are on moraines.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
