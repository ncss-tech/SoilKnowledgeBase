  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 65 percent by volume of 2 to 50 mm size pumice and the fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral and hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is assumed that the 15 bar water retention is less than 20 percent between depths of 25 to 100 cm and that the base saturation is less than 50 percent between depths of 25 to 75 cm.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is typically very paragravelly ashy loam but ranges to ashy sandy loam or ashy silt loam in both paragravelly and very paragravelly phases.\nThe C horizon ranges from extremely paragravelly ashy loam to 100 percent pumiceous cinders."

The soils formed in alluvium from volcanic pumice and ash.  They are in a marine-type climate having cool dry summers and mild wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 60 inches. The mean January temperature is 35 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost- free season is 125 to 175 days."
