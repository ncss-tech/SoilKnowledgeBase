  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenoma series consists of deep to fragmental pumice, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from pumiceous cinders and volcanic ash.  Glenoma soils are on alluvial fans and old stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 65 percent by volume of 2 to 50 mm size pumice and the fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral and hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is assumed that the 15 bar water retention is less than 20 percent between depths of 25 to 100 cm and that the base saturation is less than 50 percent between depths of 25 to 75 cm.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is typically very paragravelly ashy loam but ranges to ashy sandy loam or ashy silt loam in both paragravelly and very paragravelly phases.\nThe C horizon ranges from extremely paragravelly ashy loam to 100 percent pumiceous cinders."
