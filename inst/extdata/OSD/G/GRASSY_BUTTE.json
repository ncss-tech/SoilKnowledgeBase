  "OVERVIEW": "The Grassy Butte series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively or excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material.  These soils are on basalt plains and have 0 to 20 percent slopes.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Dark colors are litho-chromatic, derived from basaltic parent material.\nPartical-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches ( part of the Bw, Bk1, and part of the Bk2 horizons)"
