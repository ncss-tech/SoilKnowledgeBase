    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitterwater, Circular (T), Corbilt (T), Elkhills, Herbel (T), Kimberlina, Machone (T), McCullough, and Seaman series. Bitterwater and Machone soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Bitterwater soils also have 10 to 20 percent calcium carbonate. Circular soils recieve 8 to 12 inches of precipitation and have less than 15 percent rock fragments within the control section. Corbilt soils have a duripan at a depth of 45 to 58 inches. Elkhills soils have 5 to 20 percent calcium carbonate, 9 to 50 percent slopes, and formed in old uplifted alluvial terraces that have lithological discontinuities within depths of 40 inches. Herbel soils are moist in the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative in the summer. Kimberlina soils have a moisture control section that is moist in some part more than half the time, cumulative, that the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  McCullough soils have a thin horizon in 5YR or 7.5YR hue and have a sandy texture within a depth of 40 inches. Seaman soils are clearly stratified with some influence from volcanic ash."

Elevations are 1,800 to 4,200 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Granitepass series was established to separate out soils in the Mojave Desert mapped as the Kimberlina series. Kimberlina soils are currently mapped in both the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 7 inches (A and AC horizons)\n2.  Particle-size control section -- 10 to 40 inches (part\nof the Ck1, the Ck2 and part of the Ck3 horizons)\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 1/2002. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
