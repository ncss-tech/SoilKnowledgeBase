(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nOther features:  Carbonatic feature - calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 50 percent by weight for the whole soil.\nThe Grapit series is no longer used in Uintah County, Utah so the type location was moved to Moffat County, Colorado (Dinosaur National Monument) in 1998 and a new typical pedon was used.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nPrior classification was loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, Aridic Calciborolls.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
