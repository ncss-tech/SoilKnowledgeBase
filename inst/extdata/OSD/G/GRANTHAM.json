The soil is strongly acid through extremely acid, except where the surface and upper subsoil have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.

There are few to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of this horizon contains more than 30 percent silt, and the sand fraction is dominantly very fine.\nThe BCg or CBg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Trebloc series is in the same family and the Bethera, Coxville, Leaf, Liddell, Myatt, Pasquotank, Rains, and Woodington series are in closely-related families.  Trebloc soils are on terraces, and in depressions and drainageways on uplands, typically have higher silt content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, and have lower average yields. (See \"Remarks\").  Bethera, Coxville and Leaf soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Liddell, Pasquotank, and Woodington soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Myatt soils have more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and also have sandy 2C horizons at depths of less than 60 inches.  Rains soils have less than 30 percent silt, and fine or coarser sand dominates the sand fraction of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

In addition, Goldsboro, Foreston, and Stallings soils have less than 30 percent silt in the argillic horizon.  All the associated soils except Rains are in higher positions or are nearer to drainageways."
