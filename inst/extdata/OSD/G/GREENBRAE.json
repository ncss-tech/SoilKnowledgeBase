  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenbrae series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mostly from granitic rocks.  The Greenbrae soils are on terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
