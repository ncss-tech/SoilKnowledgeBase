  "OVERVIEW": "The Geemore series is very deep with a discontinuous cemented layer at 30 to 40 inches.  They are well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Geemore soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
