Based on lab data from associated soils and field observations.\nParticle-size control section - from the mineral soil surface to 36 inches.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nThe Giveout series was originally recognized in the Tillamook County, Oregon Soil Survey. Due to its limited extent the tentative series was discontinued from use. The concept of this series was renewed in the Benton County, Oregon Soil Survey Update, and the series type location has been moved to Benton County.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
