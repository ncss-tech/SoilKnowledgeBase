  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates range from 8 to 20 inches. This soil formed primarily in glacial till, but in some pedons the upper 20 inches or less is in water-sorted sediments. The content of rock fragments is 2 to 15 percent in the glacial till and ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the water-sorted sediment. The rock fragments are of mixed lithology, but limestone and granite are dominant. The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap has a hue of 10YR,It has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. If greater than 6 inches thick, the dry color value ismore than 5.5. The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loam. A stony phase is also recognized. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are either in the lower part of this horizon or are within 10 inches of the top of the B horizon. The texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay and 45 to 70 percent sand. It has faint to distinct, few to many clay films on faces of peds. Thin coatings of E horizon material are on faces of peds in the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk, BCk, CBk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. They have faint, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features in all parts. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk, BCk, CBk or C horizon in the Percy till phase has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. It has 12 to 18 percent clay; Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe Bk, BCk, CBk or C horizon in the Des Moines till phase has textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It has 18 to 35 percent clay. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Garnes soils have convex slope gradients commonly 0 to 4 percent but ranging from 0 to 8 percent. They are on nearly level to gently sloping glacial lake plains. They formed in a thin upper mantle of water sorted sediments and calcareous glacial till. These deposits are late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1,200 to 1,350 feet."
