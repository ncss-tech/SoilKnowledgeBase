    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 21 to 36 inches.   Thickness of the organic layers ranges from 16 to 36 inches. The subsurface tier is dominated by hemic material.  Mean annnual soil temperature is below 46 degrees F.  The soil does not freeze below 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.  pH ranges from 3.2 to 4.0 (0.01M CaCl2).\nThe value moist of the Oe layers is 2.5 or 3, the chroma moist ranges from 1 to 3.\nA C horizon may be present in some pedons.  Hue ranges from 5YR to 10YR; value moist is 4 or 5, and chroma moist is 1 or 2."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grindall soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills and valley sides and is typically associated with structural benches on these landforms.  The climate is humid maritime with an average annual precipitation of about 130 inches.  Snow remains on the ground about 9 months of the year.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is below 46 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent."
