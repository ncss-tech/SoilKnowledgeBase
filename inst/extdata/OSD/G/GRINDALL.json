  "OVERVIEW": "The Grindall series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in partially decomposed organic material that overlies bedrock of various origins.  Grindall soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills and valleysides.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 130 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 21 to 36 inches.   Thickness of the organic layers ranges from 16 to 36 inches. The subsurface tier is dominated by hemic material.  Mean annnual soil temperature is below 46 degrees F.  The soil does not freeze below 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.  pH ranges from 3.2 to 4.0 (0.01M CaCl2).\nThe value moist of the Oe layers is 2.5 or 3, the chroma moist ranges from 1 to 3.\nA C horizon may be present in some pedons.  Hue ranges from 5YR to 10YR; value moist is 4 or 5, and chroma moist is 1 or 2."
