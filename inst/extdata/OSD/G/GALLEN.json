  "OVERVIEW": "The Gallen series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from gravelly calcareous material.  Gallen soils are on hillslopes and fan terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
