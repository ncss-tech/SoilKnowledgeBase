  "OVERVIEW": "The Grifton series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands, stream terraces, and flood plains in the Coastal Plain.  The soils formed in loamy marine sediments and are underlain by alluvial marly sands and clays.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 49 inches near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A, E, and upper B horizons, unless limed, and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower B and C horizons.  Soft to hard marl fragments and iron-manganese concretions range from none to common in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more and in shades of yellow or brown are few to common in Eg horizons that have dominant chroma of 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BEg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red and with chroma of 3 or more are in BEg horizons that have dominant chroma of 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow or red and with chroma of 3 or more are in Btg horizons that have dominant chroma of 2.  Texture is dominantly sandy clay loam but may be sandy loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have thin lenses of loamy sand or fine sandy loam in the Btg horizon.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  This horizon in many pedons has mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.  If any part of the BCg horizon is within a 30 inch depth and has dominant chroma of 2, there are few to common mottles with chroma of 3 or more and in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, and there may be thin lenses of loamy sand, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, and may include thin lenses of sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY or is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is variable, ranging from fine sand to clay and the material is marly."
