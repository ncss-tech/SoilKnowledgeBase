  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A, E, and upper B horizons, unless limed, and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower B and C horizons.  Soft to hard marl fragments and iron-manganese concretions range from none to common in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more and in shades of yellow or brown are few to common in Eg horizons that have dominant chroma of 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BEg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red and with chroma of 3 or more are in BEg horizons that have dominant chroma of 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow or red and with chroma of 3 or more are in Btg horizons that have dominant chroma of 2.  Texture is dominantly sandy clay loam but may be sandy loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have thin lenses of loamy sand or fine sandy loam in the Btg horizon.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  This horizon in many pedons has mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.  If any part of the BCg horizon is within a 30 inch depth and has dominant chroma of 2, there are few to common mottles with chroma of 3 or more and in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, and there may be thin lenses of loamy sand, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, and may include thin lenses of sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY or is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is variable, ranging from fine sand to clay and the material is marly."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (This section not updated; 6/16/97) These are the Rigolette and Tooterville series.  They differ from Grifton by not having a marly 2Cg horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grifton soils are on nearly level uplands, stream terraces, and flood plains in the Coastal Plain at elevations of generally less than 100 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in loamy marine sediments and are underlain by alluvial marly sands and clays.  Near the type location, mean temperature is 62 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 49 inches."

Lumbee, Lynchburg, Rains soils are more acid throughout and have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Meggett soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the Btg horizon, and Wadmalaw soils have an umbric epipedon."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  About one-third of the acreage is cleared and used for row crops or pasture, and the rest is mainly in forest.  Chief crops grown are corn, soybeans, fescue, and ladino clover.  Common trees include loblolly pine, water oak, southern red oak, white oak, yellow poplar, blackgum, baldcypress, American sycamore, water tupelo, red maple, sweetgum, and willow oak.  Understory plants include American holly, sourwood, greenbrier, flowering dogwood, inkberry (bitter gallberry), switchcane, dwarf palmetto, southern bayberry (waxmyrtle), brackenfern, and poison ivy."
