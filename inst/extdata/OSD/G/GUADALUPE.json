  "OVERVIEW": "The Guadalupe series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to very gently sloping floodplains.  SThe slope range is 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 520 mm (21 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
