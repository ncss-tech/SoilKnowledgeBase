Blaquirre soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inch depth. Boze soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, lack mottles in the lower part of the C horizon and are gravelly. Donnel and Weitas soils lack mottles between depths of 40 and 60 inches and are well drained. Josie soils lack mottles in the lower part of the C horizon and are somewhat excessively drained. Longval and Rarick soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Suttler soils have a B2t horizon with thin wavy horizontal clayey bands, and have micaceous material throughout the soil profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 3,800 to 5,200 feet. The climate is humid continental, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with cold winters and dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 22 to 24 inches. Average January temperature is 20 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F. Average annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
