  "OVERVIEW": "The Gestrin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from glacial outwash or glacial till. Gestrin soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Blaquirre soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inch depth. Boze soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, lack mottles in the lower part of the C horizon and are gravelly. Donnel and Weitas soils lack mottles between depths of 40 and 60 inches and are well drained. Josie soils lack mottles in the lower part of the C horizon and are somewhat excessively drained. Longval and Rarick soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Suttler soils have a B2t horizon with thin wavy horizontal clayey bands, and have micaceous material throughout the soil profile."
