  "OVERVIEW": "The Guanella series consists of very deep, well or moderately well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granitic rocks, schist, and gneiss. Guanella soils are on mountain slopes, footslopes, and toeslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The Raleigh soils are shallow to bedrock and are on steep mountain slopes. The Rosane soils have irregular decreases in organic matter in the upper 30 inches and are somewhat poorly drained and are on valley bottoms and stream terraces."
