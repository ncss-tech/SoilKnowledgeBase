The Kittredge soils have argillic subsoil horizons and dark colored mollic surface horizons less than 16 inches thick and are on similar landforms as the Guanella series.  The Raleigh soils are shallow to bedrock and are on steep mountain slopes. The Rosane soils have irregular decreases in organic matter in the upper 30 inches and are somewhat poorly drained and are on valley bottoms and stream terraces."
