Bluepoint and Livefire soils are on adjacent fan aprons, have a sandy particle-size control section, and do not have an argillic or calcic horizon. Eastrange soils are on convex remnants, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section, and do not have an argillic horizon. Goldivide soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have a calcic horizon. In addition, they have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary beginning at 14 or more inches from the surface. Thermopyl soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have an argillic horizon."
