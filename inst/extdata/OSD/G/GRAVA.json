  "OVERVIEW": "The Grava series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic. They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from deposits of the Uvalde Gravel over the Goliad Formation. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (73 degrees F), and annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",
