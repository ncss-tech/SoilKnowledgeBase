Celeridge, Gabica, Gidwin, Grandeposit, Loope, Majorsplace and Realmcoy soils have lithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm.  Genoa soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Hawkridge soils have mean summer soil temperature of 15 to 17 degrees C.  Hutchley soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 28 to 35 percent clay.  Melling soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Pernog soils are dominated by stones and have more than 27 percent clay in some part of the particle-size control section.  Rozara soils are dominated by fine gravel, have rock fragments that are granitic rocks, and have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Shalcleav soils are dominated by channers and flagstones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gerdog soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite, tuff, and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,535 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 28 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 28 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 28 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 28 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
