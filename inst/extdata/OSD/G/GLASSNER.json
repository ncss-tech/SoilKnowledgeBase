  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glassner series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic family of Borollic Camborthids.  Typically they have friable, granular, calcareous A horizons, moderately fine to fine textured, calcareous, B2 horizons having brighter chroma, redder hue, or moderate grades of prismatic to blocky structure, and moderately fine to fine textured, calcareous, C horizons that have continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible for the diagnostic horizons or the subgroup and family are permissible for the series.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 4 inches but should not be deeper than the upper boundary of the B2 horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 7 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and there should be no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick above 20 inches that exceeds these limits.  Weighted average gypsum content of the control section ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The control section ranges from silty clay loam to silty clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay, between 20 and 60 percent silt and between 5 and 30 percent sand with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent and coarse fragments ranging from 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter predominate.  Mottling not due to segregated lime ranges from none to a few faint mottles but if the soil is mottled at all the chroma of the matrix material must exceed 2.\nColor of the lA horizon may range in hue from 5YR to 10R, in value from 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and in chroma from 1 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nHue of the C horizon ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from about 4 to 14 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bercail and Megon series.  The Bercail Series differs in having lithochromic hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  The Megon series differs in having hue no redder than 7.5YR and in overlying a paralithic contact above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Glassner series occurs on nearly level to sloping alluvial fans and valley sideslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The soil is developing on thick calcareous, fine textured materials weathered and locally transported from red bed shales.  At the type location the mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 59 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 90 days.  Elevation is 6,600 to 7,200 feet."
