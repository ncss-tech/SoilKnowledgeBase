  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in similar families are the Eagleview, Faunce, Gerrish, and Zimmerman series that have a mixed mineralogy class. Eagleview soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Faunce soils have carbonates within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches). Gerrish soils contain more than 14 percent gravel in the upper part of the series control section. Zimmerman soils have a similar content of medium sand and very fine sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Graycalm soils are on moraines, kames, stream terraces, outwash plains, and glacial drainage channels of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Graycalm soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 3.3 to 8.3 degrees C (38 to 47 degrees F). Frost-free period is 90 to 150 days. Elevation is 183 to 396 meters (600 to 1,300 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Grayling, Menahga, Montcalm, Roscommon, and Rubicon soils. Grayling and Menahga soils are more droughty and are on outwash plains and lake plains. Rubicon soils have spodic horizons and are on landscape positions similar to those of Graycalm soils. Montcalm soils have an argillic horizon and are on outwash plains and moraines. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils and poorly drained Roscommon soils have zones of aquic conditions and may be in a drainage sequence with the Graycalm soils."
