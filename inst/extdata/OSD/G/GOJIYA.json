  "OVERVIEW": "The Gojiya series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Gojiya soils are in drainageways, stream terraces, and lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
