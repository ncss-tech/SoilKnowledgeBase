  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section averages 40 to 50 percent clay and 40 to 85 percent rock fragments. Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include all or part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. It is silt loam with 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, of which 5 to 20 percent are gravel, 10 to 45 percent are cobbles, and 2 to 15 percent are stones.\nThe BA horizon has color similar to the A horizon. It is very cobbly silt loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam with 5 to 40 percent gravel, 2 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is clay and averages 40 to 50 percent clay. It has about 40 to 85 percent rock fragments, of which 10 to 25 percent are gravel, 30 to 60 percent are cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent are stones."

Laufer soils have 35 to 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dry 80 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Camaspatch, Longcreek, Loomer, Lorella, Pioche, Ruckles, Vantage, and Waterbury soils are usually dry for more than 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Flatron, Ruckles, and Waterbury soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Radec soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 10 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gwinly soils are on hills, plateaus, structural benches, mountains, and canyons. Slopes are 2 to 120 percent. The soils formed in loess and colluvium weathered from basalt and tuff overlying basalt. Elevations are 1,400 to 4,600 feet. At higher elevations these soils are found only on south slopes. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Rockly soils are less than 10 inches to bedrock, are loamy-skeletal and lack an argillic horizon. Snell soils are frigid and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Ukiah soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and have less than 35 percent rock fragments."
