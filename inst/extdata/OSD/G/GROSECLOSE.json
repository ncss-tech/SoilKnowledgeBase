Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of chert, siltstone, shale, and sandstone range from 0 to 75 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 35 percent in the Bt and C horizon.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon, where present,  has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agnos, Boden, Braddock, Buckhall, Buffstat, Christian, Clifton, Fairfax, Gassville, Goresville, Howell, Littlejoe, Lodi, Monmouth, Muse, Nantahala, Pervina, Quantico, Sequoia, Timberville, Trappist, Unison, Warminster, and Woolwine series in the same family.  Agnos, Gassville, and Muse soils have a moderate shrink-swell potential. Boden soils are shallower to bedrock and contain less than 20 percent silt.  Braddock soils have dominant hue of 2.5YR or 10YR in the Bt horizon and a moderately permeable subsoil.  Buckhall soils have rock fragments of quartz and granite.  Buffstat and Littlejoe soils formed in serecite schist and other fine-grained material.  Christian and Lodi soils do not have variegated colors from weathered shale and siltstone fragments at a depth of 20 to 40 inches, and in addition have moderate permeability and shrink-swell potential. Clifton soils have flakes of mica throughout the solum.   Fairfax, Goresville (T), and Timberville soils have lithological discontinuities in the solum.  Howell and Monmouth soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower part of the Bt horizon and in addition, Monmouth soils contain glauconite.  Nantahala (T) soils are deep to paralithic contact of metasedimentary rock. Pervina soils have more than 60 inches of rainfall annually and have cool moist winters.  Quantico soils have rounded quartz gravel. Sequoia and Trappist soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Unison soils contain rounded or subrounded gravel or cobbles of crystalline rocks. Warminster soils formed in Triassic red shale residuum. Woolwine soils are moderately deep to mafic bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Groseclose soils are on nearly level to very steep convex ridges and sideslopes in the Appalachian Valley.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in materials weathered from interbedded limestone, shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."

Poplimento, Berks Frederick, and Vertrees soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Groseclose series.  Poplimento soils have a higher base saturation. Litz soils have a cambic horizon that contains more than 35 percent rock fragments. Frederick and Vertrees soils have thicker sola.  Timberville and Ernest soils are along drainageways and in depressions.  Timberville soils have a buried Bt horizon; Ernest soils have a fragipan."
