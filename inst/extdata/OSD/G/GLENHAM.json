    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  The soil can contain up to 10 percent by volume of pebbles and/or cobbles throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or loam.  It contains few to many fine or medium accumulations of carbonates and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Few or common, faint or distinct mottles inherent to the parent material are in the lower part in most pedons.  Few or common accumulations of gypsum and other salts are in the lower part of the C horizon in most pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gosper, Houdek, Ree, Reventon, Verdigre, Wewela and Wineg series.  Gosper and Ree soils formed in sandy and loamy alluvium and in addition, the Gosper soils typically contain less clay.  Houdek soils typically have thicker sola, carbonates at greater depths and are more moist.  Reventon soils are dry in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Verdigre soils have free carbonates below a depth of 18 inches.  Wewela soils have clayey materials between 20 and 40 inches. Wineg soils have calcic horizons."

Glenham soils formed in loam or clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Betts soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are typically on steeper parts of the landscape.  Cavo and Demky soils have a natric horizon and are on smoother parts of the landscape.  Eakin soils are fine-silty and are on similar landscapes.  Java soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on crests and ridges above the Glenham soils.  Prosper soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and are in swales. Raber soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes."
