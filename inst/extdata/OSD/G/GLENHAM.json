Gosper and Ree soils formed in sandy and loamy alluvium and in addition, the Gosper soils typically contain less clay.  Houdek soils typically have thicker sola, carbonates at greater depths and are more moist.  Reventon soils are dry in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Verdigre soils have free carbonates below a depth of 18 inches.  Wewela soils have clayey materials between 20 and 40 inches. Wineg soils have calcic horizons."

Betts soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are typically on steeper parts of the landscape.  Cavo and Demky soils have a natric horizon and are on smoother parts of the landscape.  Eakin soils are fine-silty and are on similar landscapes.  Java soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on crests and ridges above the Glenham soils.  Prosper soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and are in swales. Raber soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes."
