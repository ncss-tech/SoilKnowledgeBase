  "OVERVIEW": "The Gavel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt or andesite.  Gavel soils are on mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section (9 to 30 inches or the paralithic contact) is moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1.  It is dry in all parts from July 15 to November 1 (107 days).  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 15 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 15 to November 1.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick and in some pedons includes part of the B horizon.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Rock fragments on the surface, mostly cobbles and gravel, range from 15 to 25 percent. Base saturation (by sum of cations) between the depth of 10 to 30 inches ranges from 60 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2; and 5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is stony loam or gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and gravel, range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/2; 5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4; 5YR 3/3 or 3/4.

Bluenose, Fordice and Keuterville soils are greater than 60 inches deep.  Tekoa soils have loam and silt loam textures in the fine-earth fraction of the subsoil, have C horizons, are influenced by loess and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Vilot soils have control sections with 50 to 80 percent rock fragments and 27 to 35 percent clay.  In addition, the A horizon is very strongly through medium acid and the B horizon is very strongly or strongly acid."
