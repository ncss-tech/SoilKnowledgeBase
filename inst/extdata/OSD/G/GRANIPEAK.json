  "OVERVIEW": "The Granipeak series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Granipeak soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

Closkey soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts, are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in summer months due to convection storms.  Devils soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts, are dominated by gravel, and have less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Gowjai soils are deep to lithic contacts, have a horizon with durinodes, and average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Jivas soils are deep to lithic contacts, are dominated by gravel, and have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Millan soils are very deep, are dominated by gravel, and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Torro soils are very deep and are dominated by gravel."
