    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belate, Burnborough, Closkey, Devils, Gowjai, Jivas, Millan, Sumine, and Torro series.\nBelate and Burnborough soils are very deep, have less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are dominantly gravel-size.  Closkey soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts, are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in summer months due to convection storms.  Devils soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts, are dominated by gravel, and have less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Gowjai soils are deep to lithic contacts, have a horizon with durinodes, and average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Jivas soils are deep to lithic contacts, are dominated by gravel, and have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Millan soils are very deep, are dominated by gravel, and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Torro soils are very deep and are dominated by gravel."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,135 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
