  "OVERVIEW": "The Garo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from shale.  Garo soils are on basin floors and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C. (37 degrees F.).",
