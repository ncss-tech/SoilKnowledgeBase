Chalco soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser sands.  Espint soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 15 to 36 cm from the soil surface, have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C., and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer.  Xman soils have mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C. and do not have subhorizons with secondary carbonates."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gumble soils are on rock pediments and hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff or tuffaceous siltstone.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,015 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
