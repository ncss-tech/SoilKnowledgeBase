Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: albic horizon - the zone 8 to 18 centimeters (E horizon); spodic horizon - the zone from 18 to 48 centimeters; a lithologic discontinuity from sandy materials to loamy dense materials at 66 centimeters.  Redoximorphic features present at a depth of 48 to 66 centimeters.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to S02MI-153-027 for NSSL data on typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
