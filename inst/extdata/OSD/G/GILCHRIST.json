  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilchrist series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy deposits overlying dense loamy materials on ground moraines, outwash plains, and drumlins.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high and very high in the sandy materials and low in the loamy dense material.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
