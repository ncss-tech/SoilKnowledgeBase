  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to free carbonates is 18 to 36 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick. Rock fragments comprise 1 to 6 percent of the solum and 5 to 15 percent of the C horizon. Carbonates are disseminated and in few to many 5 to 10 mm diameter soft masses and threads in the Bk and C horizons. Calcium carbonate equivalent in these horizons is 15 to 25 percent. A coarser textured layer (lag line) as much as 6 inches in thickness overlies the rock contact in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 1 or 2, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam or loam and has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure. It is moderately acid or slightly acid. Some pedons have an A3 horizon as much as 6 inches in thickness.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has few through many high chroma mottles in some to all parts in some pedons. It is clay loam or loam. It has weak through strong prismatic structure which parts to weak or moderate subangular blocky in the upper part and moderate or strong angular or subangular blocky structure in the lower part. It is friable or firm. It is strongly through slightly acid in the upper part grading to slightly or moderately alkaline in the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is loam or clay loam,  It has few to many high chroma redox and few to many dark oxides of iron and manganese in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Germantown soils have convex slopes with gradient of 1 to 6 percent on glaciated uplands. They formed in a 20- to 40-inch thick mantle of loamy calcareous glacial till of Late Wisconsin age. This till overlies quartzite bedrock. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Germantown soils are the dominant ones in their area of occurrence. A poorly drained variant of Webster soils are associated in a few places. Also, well drained Clarion and moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Nicollet soils are associated in a few places. These soils formed in glacial sediments that are more than 40 inches thick."
