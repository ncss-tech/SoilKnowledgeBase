  "STATES": "NM,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gruver series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
