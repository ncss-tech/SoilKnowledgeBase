  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 20 inches, thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and depth to the underlying bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic matter of the upper 15 inches is approximately .6 percent and the sand/clay ratio is typically less than 1.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base-saturated.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 70 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Typically, the solum extends to bedrock but in some pedons a thin C horizon is present between the solum and bedrock.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are usually less than 5 percent throughout most of the solum.  They are most numerous in the horizon immediately above the bedrock.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 58 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 78 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist in some part between depth of 4 and 12 inches for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degree F. and are moist in all parts between depths of 4\nand 12 inches for less than 60 cumulative days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.6).  Typically, the horizon has fine granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.6).  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is typically light clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent silt, and 20 to 45 percent sand, with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 7.0 to 7.8).  It has some oriented clay films on peds, in root channels, or as coatings on rock fragments.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6) and has approximately 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adena, Bidman, Big Horn, Briggsdale, and Campo series.  Adena, Bidman, Big Horn, and Campo soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Briggsdale soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gibbler soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slope gradients usually range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in thin deposits of reddish brown eolian sediments derived from redbeds overlying sandstone bedrock.  At the type location average annual precipitation is 15 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
