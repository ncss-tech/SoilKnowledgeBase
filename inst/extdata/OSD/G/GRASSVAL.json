Bigfrog soils are noncalcareous above the duripan. Chuckridge, Handpah, Minu and Roval soils have summer moisture. Chuska soils have a noncalcareous upper argillic and a 10 to 30 cm thick indurated duripan.  Dewar soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 36 to 50 cm deep to a duripan.  Pipeline soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and are noncalcareous in the upper argillic. Roseworth soils have A horizons that are neutral.  Thoms soils lack secondary carbonate in the argillic and are neutral to slightly acid. Wellington soils have noncalcareous and neutral or slightly acid."
