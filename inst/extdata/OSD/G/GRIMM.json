  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter, and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is more than 41 degrees F.  Rock fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section average 40 to 60 percent but range from 35 to 70 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Where value is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist, the thickness is less than 5 inches.  The A1 horizon is sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or clay loam and has 0 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and ranges from 3 to 9 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is dominantly very gravelly loam sandy or very gravelly sand, but has some layers of sandy loam, gravelly sand, and cobbly sand.  The sandy loam C horizon occurs only in some pedons, is immediately under the sandy loam or clay loam A1 horizons and is usually less than 10 inches thick.  The rock fragments in the C horizon average from 40 to 60 percent, but range from 0 to 70 percent in individual layers.  Only the thin layers of sandy loam in the C horizon lack rock fragments.  The rock fragments larger than 3 inches range from 0 to 30 percent.  The C horizon ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adilis, Mathis, Sheeprock and Rivra series.  Adilis soils are neutral, are less calcareous or noncalcareous and have a water table at depths of 1 to 3 feet.  Rivra soils have a water table that fluctuates from less than 30 inches to more than 60 inches during the year, and remains within 60 inches during the late spring and early summer.  Mathis soils have a mesic temperature regime.  Sheeprock soils have a xeric moisture regime and a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grimm soils are at elevations of 6,400 to 7,200 feet.  They occur on all exposures, on alluvial fans, steep hills and mountain slopes.  Where elevations exceed about 6,900 feet, the soils occur mainly on steep south facing slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent on the fans and range from 25 to 50 percent on the hills and mountain slopes.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate and basic igneous rock.  The climate is semi- arid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 80 to 90 days."
