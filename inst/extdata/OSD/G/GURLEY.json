  "OVERVIEW": "The Gurley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum on interbedded sandstone and shale.  Gurley soils are on mesa tops and high terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 61 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches.  The upper 7 inches after mixing meets the requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons and 10 to 35 percent in the C horizon and are mainly pebble size fragments.  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 28 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bt horizon is dominantly clay loam with clay ranging from 35 through 40 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 6 to 8, 5 to 8 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 50 percent.  The texture is loam and gravelly loam."
