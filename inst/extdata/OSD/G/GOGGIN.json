Mineral grains derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are also a component of the soil parent material.\nLandform:  Slightly elevated beach ridges and stable dunes along the edge of the Great Salt Lake.\nSlope:  1 to 6 percent.\nElevation: 4,205 to 4,215 feet.\nMean annual temperature:  46 to 52 degrees F.\nMean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches.\nWettest months:  October through May.\nDriest months:  June through September.\nFrost-free period:  160 to 180 days."
