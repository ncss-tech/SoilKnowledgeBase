The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loess and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the till. Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the till."
