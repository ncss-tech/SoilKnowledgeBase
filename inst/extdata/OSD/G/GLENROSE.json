These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, Latah Formation, and glacial till, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Kramerhill soils are hills and mountains and are deep to a paralithic contact. Lakestarr soils are on foothills and are deep to a densic layer and have thin mantle of volcanic ash. Larkin and Southwick soils are on loess hills and are fine-silty. Santa soils are on foothills and are moderately deep to a fragipan. Spokane soils are hills and mountains are moderately deep to a paralithic contact."

Use of Glenrose will need investigation in the Colville Indian Reservation survey, especially with respect to glacial till parent material (less than 1,000 acres).\nGlenrose soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
