  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenrose series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, Latah formation and glacial till, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Glenrose soils are on foothills, outwash plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Kramerhill soils are hills and mountains and are deep to a paralithic contact. Lakestarr soils are on foothills and are deep to a densic layer and have thin mantle of volcanic ash. Larkin and Southwick soils are on loess hills and are fine-silty. Santa soils are on foothills and are moderately deep to a fragipan. Spokane soils are hills and mountains are moderately deep to a paralithic contact."

Use of Glenrose will need investigation in the Colville Indian Reservation survey, especially with respect to glacial till parent material (less than 1,000 acres).\nGlenrose soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
