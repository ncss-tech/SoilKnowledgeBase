  "OVERVIEW": "The Grassypoint series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very low saturated hydraulic conductivity soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits. These nearly level soils occur on tidal marshes on estuaries. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
