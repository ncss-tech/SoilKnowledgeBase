    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the underlying sand, gravel, and cobble beds is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the Bt horizon is 12 to 24 inches. Depth to a continuous horizon of calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate accumulation is 12 to 24 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The sand and silt fractions contain 3 to 15 percent dark colored, magnetic ferromagnesian-rich minerals. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, range from 0 to 15 percent above the sand, gravel, and cobble beds.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon is loam or clay loam and has 0 to 15 percent gravel. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and has more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic subangular blocky or angular blocky structure. It is slightly or moderate alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or sandy clay loam. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or is neutral. The fine earth fraction is sand or loamy sand. It has 35 to 60 percent basalt gravel and 10 to 15 percent basalt cobbles."

The soils formed in calcareous alluvial material derived principally from basalt and overlie basalt sand, gravel, and cobbles. Elevation is 3,800 to 5,200 feet. Average annual precipitation is 5 to 9 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees to 48 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
