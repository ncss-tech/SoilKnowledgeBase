  "OVERVIEW": "The Gamelake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Gamelake soils are on broad ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 140 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 20 percent clay, more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand, and has 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam averaging 10 to 25 percent clay.
