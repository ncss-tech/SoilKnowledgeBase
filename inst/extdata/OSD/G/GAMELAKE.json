    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 20 percent clay, more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand, and has 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam averaging 10 to 25 percent clay.  It has 35 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam averaging 10 to 20 percent clay, with more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand.  It has 40 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly coarse sandy loam averaging 5 to 15 percent clay, with more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand.

Balsam soils have a particle-size control section dominated by stones and cobbles of mica gneiss, granite, hornblende gneiss, or hornblende schist origin with and content of mica flakes ranging from few to common throughout the solum.  Illahee soils have less than 30 percent coarser than fine sand in the Bw horizon and are dominated by rock fragments of basalt or welded tuff origin throughout the solum.  Scaredman soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Stackyards soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gamelake soils are on metastable broad ridgetops and active south-facing side slopes of mountains.   Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 120 to 160 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
