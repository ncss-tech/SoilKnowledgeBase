  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Graysill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or slope alluvium derived from sandstone and interbedded shale. Graysill soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, and mesas.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
