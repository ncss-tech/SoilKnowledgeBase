  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to stratification ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 45 inches.  The particle-size control section averages more than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand and 15 to 49 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments are absent throughout the profile.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and is slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of 80 inches or more.  Redox features are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches and continue to 60 inches or more.  Saturation occurs in or above the spodic horizon and within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nGastrow soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color like the Bt part described above.  It is typically fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam but in some pedons, it is stratified, at least in the lower part.  Strata are typically silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with thin strata of very fine sand or fine sand but thin strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically stratified and is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with thin strata of very fine sand or fine sand but strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons."

Related soils are the Alcona and Annalake series.  Assinins soils are sandy in the upper 20 to 40 inches of the series control section.  Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, and Gaastra soils do not have a glossic horizon.  (Michigan will delete glossic from RIC of Gaastra.)  Richter soils have free carbonates within 40 inches.  Robago soils average less than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Rockers soils are sandy in the upper 15 to 30 inches of the series control section.  Worcester soils have more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section within 40 inches.  Zeba soils have sola terminated by a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Alcona soils do not have redox features or saturation in the control section.  Annalake soils do not have redox features or aquic conditions within 20 inches."

The well drained Alcona soils, the moderately well drained Annalake soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Tonkey soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is less silt and very fine sand in the soil.  Fence soils are nearby on slightly higher landscape positions where there is less sand in the soil."

Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, yellow birch, balsam fir, paper birch, eastern hemlock, and quaking aspen.  A few areas have been cleared and are used for cropland or pastureland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
