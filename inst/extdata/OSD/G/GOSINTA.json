Birdow, Blackrock Dagor, Lakeview and Monroe soils are well drained.  Coit soils are poorly drained.  Eastcan soils have mildly to strongly alkaline A horizons, and have an average annual soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F.  Goose Creek soils have a control section which is dominantly silty clay loam.  Soquel soils have an average annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F, and a frost-free season of 220 to 275 days.  Shoepeg soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Willowdale soils have 10 to 20 percent pumice."
