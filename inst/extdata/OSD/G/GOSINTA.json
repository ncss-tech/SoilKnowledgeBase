  "OVERVIEW": "The Gosinta series consists of soils that are moderately well drained and very deep, that formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on alluvial terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
