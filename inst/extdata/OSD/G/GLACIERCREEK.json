  "OVERVIEW": "The Glaciercreek series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash or till.  Glaciercreek soils are on outwash terraces, kame terraces, stream terraces or moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
