  "OVERVIEW": "The Gladwin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains, lake plains, valley trains, deltas, and low beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
