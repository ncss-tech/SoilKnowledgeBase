    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gladwin soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, valley trains, deltas, and low beach ridges. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Gladwin soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial material of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 660 to 889 mm (26 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.7 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F). Frost-free period is 80 to 160 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1,200 feet)."

The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between October and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas are cropped to corn, hay, small grains, and beans and some vegetables. Artificial drainage is needed to successfully grow most crops. A large part is in permanent pasture, forest, or is idle cropland. Native vegetation is northern hardwoods such as quaking aspen, paper birch, sugar maple, with some balsam fir, eastern hemlock, and eastern white pine."
