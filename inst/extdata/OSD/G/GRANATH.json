  "OVERVIEW": "The Granath series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Granath soils are on mesas, hills, and stable alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
