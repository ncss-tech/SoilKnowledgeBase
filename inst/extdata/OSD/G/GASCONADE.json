  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on steep dissected landscapes and generally in isolated glade areas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Gasconade soils formed in thin clayey layers with a considerable amount of rock fragments from residuum of the underlying limestone bedrock.  Depth to bedrock varies greatly within a short distance.  Mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 45 inches."
