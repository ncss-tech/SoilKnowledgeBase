  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenleaf soils are on level to strongly sloping, slightly to moderately dissected, low and medium terraces at elevations of 2,100 to 3,200 feet.  The slopes are uniform and less than 2 percent but may range up to 30 percent.  The soils formed in laminated, silty lacustrine deposits or old alluvium, though the upper part may be influenced by loess.  The climate is semiarid, with dry summers.  Average annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches, including 0.5 to 2 feet of snowfall.  The average frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."
