  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenleaf series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in lacustrine deposits.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The slopes are uniform and less than 2 percent but may range up to 30 percent.  The soils formed in laminated, silty lacustrine deposits or old alluvium, though the upper part may be influenced by loess.  The climate is semiarid, with dry summers.  Average annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches, including 0.5 to 2 feet of snowfall.  The average frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."
