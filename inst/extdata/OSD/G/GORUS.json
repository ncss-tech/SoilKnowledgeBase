Alfic Cryochrepts have an ochric epipedon, a cambic horizon, and a zone that would be an argillic except for thickness.  Laboratory data:  S55MT.\n4/2008 This series was never entered into the OSD files.  An old copy of the OSD was located during the re-classification of the cryepts and was entered to the OSD files as reference.  Classification was originally Fine-loamy, mixed Alfic Cryochrepts."
