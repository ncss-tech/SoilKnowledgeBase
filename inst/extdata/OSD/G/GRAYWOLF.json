    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are the following:\nOchric epipedon\nAlbic horizon - 1 to 4 inches (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon - 4 to 31 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, and E/Bt3 subhorizons)\nArgillic horizon - 4 to 61 inches (E/Bt1 through E/Bt3, Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 subhorizons)\nOxyaquic feature - apparent water table is at its highest depth between November through April and is present for 120 to 180 cumulative days.\nPSCS - zone from 4 to 24 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, and E/Bt3 subhorizons)\nThe soils formed in relic proglacial lake deposits in a wetter environment.  The presence of the albic materials and redox features in the upper horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.  Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on the color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will classify as aquic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
