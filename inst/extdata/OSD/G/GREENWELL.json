  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenwell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over colluvium and residuum from volcanic mudflow.  Greenwell soils are on lahar over narrow basalt plateaus in volcanic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, (2032 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, (9 degrees C).",
