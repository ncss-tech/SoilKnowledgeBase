(5 to 8 inches thick)\nC1--7 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay,\ngrayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; many coarse faint mottles of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist and many coarse distinct mottles of reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist, on the outside of some of the clay fragments; the reddish mottles which decrease in number and size\nwith depth, do not penetrate the fragments; the fragments are of variable size but are mainly about 2 inches across the axis; the interfaces are dull and not shiny; distinct horizontal cleavage planes; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; very few pores\nin the clay fragments; contains few remnants of leaves on the interfaces; calcareous; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth\nboundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils, when dry, have cracks 1 to\n10 cm wide that reach to a depth of at least 50 cm from the\nsurface.  Soil salinity ranges from none to moderately affected.\nThe Ap or surface layer is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2),\nlight brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), or pale brown (10YR\n6/3).  In pedons with moist values less than 3.5 the layer is less than 25 cm thick.  Most pedons contain recent sediments, and the surface layer is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), or\nlight gray (10YR 7/2) with few to common yellowish and brownish mottles.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is clay or silty clay with clay content ranging from 45 to 60 percent.  Bedding planes\nare few to common.  Loamy strata 1 to 2 inches thick occur at\ndepths below 40 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same\nfamily.  Series in similar families include the Aransas, Flamingo, Harlingen, Hialeah, Ijam, and Matamoros series.  Aransas soils\nhave color values of the A horizons less than 3.5 when moist.  Harlingen soils have intersecting slickensides.  Ijam soils have\nmean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Flamingo\nand Hialeah soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Matamoros soils\nlack mottles or matrix colors that are due to wetness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grulla soils occupy slightly depressed to\nnearly level areas in active flood plains that overflow about\ntwice in 5 years and in old partially filled resacas in inactive stream channels along major streams.  These soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments several feet thick.  The climate is\nsubtropical.  Annual precipitation ranges from about 17 to 30\ninches, mean annual air temperature is 71 degrees to 74 degrees\nF., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index is about 22 to 34."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow\nrunoff or ponded; very slow permeability.  Unless artifically drained, water remains on the surface for several weeks after\nlarge rains.  The soils are usually saturated at some season along during the year, usually during the fall or winter months."
