  "OVERVIEW": "The Goosmus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial outwash of mixed mineralogy on terraces. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 17 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 43 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual temperature at 20 inches is about 44 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days. The mineralogy is mixed. The thickness of solum ranges from 14 to 25 inches. The upper part of the control section has more than 30 percent pyroclastic glass. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 5 to 25 percent in the upper part of the control section and from 30 to 60 percent in the lower part.\nThe A horizons, in 10YR hue, range in dry values of 4 or 5, and moist value of 2, moist and dry chromas of 1 or 2; texture is ashy loam or ashy sandy loam; and reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe BA horizon, in 10YR hue, range in dry values of 5 or 6, and moist values of 3, moist and dry chromas of 3 or 4; texture is ashy loam or ashy sandy loam; and reaction is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y  value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4; moist and dry. The texture ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loamy sand; and reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon ranges from very gravelly loamy sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand; reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline; and may have lime accumulation on the undersides of some gravel."
