  "STATES": "NE,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gering series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium over gravelly coarse sand on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F at the type location.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  The depth to gravelly coarse sand ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam and fine sandy loam, but the range includes very fine sandy loam, silt loam and silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  An alkali phase is recognized.  Reaction in the alkali phase ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Haverson, Las, and Las Animas soils lack gravelly coarse sand within depths of 40 inches.  McGrew soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  McCuligan soils are in the sandy family. Las, Las Animas, McGrew, and McCuligan soils are on similar landscapes.  Haverson soils are higher on the landscape.  McCuligan soils are lower on the landscape."

The major crops are corn, alfalfa, potatoes, dry edible beans, and sugar beets.  Where the soils are in native vegetation the principal grasses are big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, prairie cordgrass, and sedges."
