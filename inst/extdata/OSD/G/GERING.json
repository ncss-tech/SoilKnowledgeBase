    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  The depth to gravelly coarse sand ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam and fine sandy loam, but the range includes very fine sandy loam, silt loam and silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  An alkali phase is recognized.  Reaction in the alkali phase ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gering soils are on nearly level bottom lands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches."

Haverson, Las, and Las Animas soils lack gravelly coarse sand within depths of 40 inches.  McGrew soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  McCuligan soils are in the sandy family. Las, Las Animas, McGrew, and McCuligan soils are on similar landscapes.  Haverson soils are higher on the landscape.  McCuligan soils are lower on the landscape."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage of Gering soils are cultivated and irrigated.  The remainder is used for rangeland.  The major crops are corn, alfalfa, potatoes, dry edible beans, and sugar beets.  Where the soils are in native vegetation the principal grasses are big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, prairie cordgrass, and sedges."
