  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerow series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic ash, basalt, rhyolite and tuffs. Gerow soils are in wet meadows, swales, drainageways and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
