These soils formed in alluvial and colluvial deposits of mixed materials from sedimentary and igneous rock.  The climate is semi-arid with mean annual temperature of 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches with about 70 percent falling during the frost-free period.  The frost-free period is about 120 to 190 days."
