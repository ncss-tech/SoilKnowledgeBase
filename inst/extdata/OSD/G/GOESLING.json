  "OVERVIEW": "The Goesling series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale on broad ridges, fan terraces and mesas. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
