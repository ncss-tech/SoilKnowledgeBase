  "OVERVIEW": "The Glendive series consists of very deep, moderately well or well drained soils that formed in stratified loamy calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
