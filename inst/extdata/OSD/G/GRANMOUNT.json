    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Granmount soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,440 to 4,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
