  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldcord series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in an admixture of loess and gravelly glacial till overlying metamorphic and igneous bedrock.  Goldcord soils are on crests and steep backslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 33 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",

Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 40 percent with 5 to 40 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobble.\nThe AC horizon has hue from 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 55 percent with 30 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobble.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR through 5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 2 through 4.
