Base saturation of the surface horizon is assumed to be less than 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue from 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 40 percent with 5 to 40 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobble.\nThe AC horizon has hue from 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 55 percent with 30 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobble.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR through 5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 55 percent with 30 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobble."

They formed in an admixture of loess and glacial till over consolidated igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  The climate is transitional between maritime and continental.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 33 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent."
