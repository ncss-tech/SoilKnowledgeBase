  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldmine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from igneous rocks. Goldmine soils are on mountain hillslopes. Slopes range from 3 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 mm (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
