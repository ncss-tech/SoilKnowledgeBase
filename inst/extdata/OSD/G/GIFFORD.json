    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2Btg or 2Cg horizon is 30 to 50 inches.  These soils have deep wide cracks, usually during summer months.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 with few to many Fe masses that have hue of 7.5YR and 10YR with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture commonly is silty clay, but includes silty clay loam in the lower part.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with higher chroma Fe masses.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or silt loam with sand content of more than 10 percent or clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have 2C horizons that are silt loam with more than 10 percent sand, loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a sandy substratum."

Bevier soils are somewhat poorly drained and have at least a few pebbles in the lower one-half of the control section.  Kilwinning soils have less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Leonard soils have subhorizons in the lower one-half of the control section that have less than 50 percent silt and less than 27 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in loess and silty sediments or loess and alluvium. Both the silty sediments and the alluvium have more than 10 percent sand. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chariton soils on nearly level stream terraces above the Gifford soils and the Colo, Nodaway, and Wabash soils on the lower adjacent flood plains. Chariton soils have an abrupt textural change. Colo, Nodaway, and Wabash soils do not have argillic horizons."
