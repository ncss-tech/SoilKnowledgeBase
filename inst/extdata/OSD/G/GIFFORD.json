  "OVERVIEW": "The Gifford series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loess and silty sediments or loess and alluvium. These soils are on side slopes of benches and have slopes of 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Texture commonly is silty clay, but includes silty clay loam in the lower part.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with higher chroma Fe masses.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or silt loam with sand content of more than 10 percent or clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have 2C horizons that are silt loam with more than 10 percent sand, loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a sandy substratum."
