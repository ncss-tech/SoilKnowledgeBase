  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to siliceous sandy residuum ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The sandy residuum has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser.  Typically, coarse fragments are absent in the silty or loamy mantle but volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the pedon but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 to 5.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.   It is typically sandy loam or loam but, in some pedons, it is sandy clay loam.  Transition horizons with less than 18 percent clay are less than 5 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a 3BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand residuum with less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (0.2 to 20 mm fraction).\nThe 3C horizon has color like the 3BC horizon above.  It is fine sand or sand residuum with less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (0.02 to 20 mm fraction).  In some pedons, the 3C horizon has thin (1/8 inch to 1 inch) strata of loamy sand weathered from the sandstone.\nThe 3Cr horizon has color like the 3BC horizon described above.  It is sandstone and is a paralithic contact.  It grades to a 3R horizon with increasing depth in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dresden, Meridian, Merimod, Merit, and Sattre series.  Related soils are the Elevasil, Gale, Hixton, and Silverhill series.  Dresden, Meridian, Merimod, Merit, and Sattre soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Elevasil, Gale, and Hixton soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Elevasil soils are coarse-loamy and Gale soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Silverhill soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gardenvale soils are on nearly level to gently sloping pediments underlain by sandstone.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 6 percent.  Gardenvale soils formed in silty and loamy eolian deposits or alluvium underlain by siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."

The well drained Bilson soils on areas of adjacent stream terraces where there is more sand and less silt and clay in the soil and where the depth to sandstone is greater than 60 inches.  The well drained Elevasil and Hixton soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Gardenvale soils where the depth to sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The well drained Merit soils are on areas of adjacent stream terraces where the depth to sandstone is greater than 60 inches.  The well drained Silverhill soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Gardenvale soils where there is more sand and less silt and clay in the soil."
