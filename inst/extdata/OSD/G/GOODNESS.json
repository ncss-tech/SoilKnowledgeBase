The upper part of the particle-size control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 22 to 33 inches and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, and phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 30 to 50 percent for air dried samples, and acid oxalate iron of 0.5 to 1.5 percent.  The lower part of the particle-size control section lacks andic soil properties and has a moist bulk density of over 0.90 g/cc.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
