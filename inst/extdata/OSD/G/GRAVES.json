Mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 0 to 30 consecutive days following the summer solstice; udic moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and andic soil properties.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.80 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 35 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  Organic matter is 10 to 20 percent.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam."
