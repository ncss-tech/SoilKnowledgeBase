  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil salinity (EC) ranges from 4 to 16 dS/m.  COLE is estimated to be more than 0.09 in mineral horizons, but because the soil is continuously saturated it does not crack to a depth of 20 inches.  All layers at depths of 8 to 20 inches below the mineral surface have an n-value of more than 0.7.  The mineral layer within the 10- to 40-inch control section has 35 to 60 percent clay content.\nThe Oa horizon is 4 to 16 inches thick and consists of muck, mucky peat, peaty muck, or peat.  Color is in hue of 7,5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction  ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline, but it becomes strongly acid or very strongly acid after drainage.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Texture is clay or silty clay.   Iron concentrations are brownish and/or olive in color.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline, but it becomes moderately acid to very strongly acid in the upper part after drainage.  Depth to underlying layers with n-values of 0.7 or less ranges from 20 to 40 inches below the mineral surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gentilly soils are in marshlands in the lower Mississippi River delta and coastal areas that are dominantly slightly to moderately saline.  Typically they occur on subsiding distributaries of the Mississippi River.  The underlying firm clays probably consolidated before subsidence.  Mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. near the type location.  Slope is less than 1 percent."
