  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 5 to 10 inches.  Clay content in the thin Bt ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Coarse fragments in the particle-size control section average less than 15 percent.  They are dominantly fine (less than 1/2 inch) pebbles.  Pebbles range from 0 to 25 percent in the lower C horizons.  Some pedons have discontinuous streaks of visible calcium carbonate in the C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand with some medium to very coarse subangular sand grains.  Coarse fragments of fine pebbles range from 0 to 25 percent in the lower C horizons."

Slopes are 10 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 75 to 95 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The name is coined.  Diagnostic features include an ochric epipedon from 0 to 3 inches, and an argillic horizon from 3 to 7 inches.   Borollic feature, organic carbon, and soil temperature regime meet the requirements for Borollic.  The particle-size control section is 3 to 40 inch zone (Bt, 2BC, 2C1, and part of 2C2 horizons).\nThe family class was changed in 1990 from \"sandy\" to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.
