The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a moderately cemented duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Clay content by field observation is 15 to 25 percent. The shape of the rock fragments are rounded to subrounded.  The solum has estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc, phosphate retention of 85 to 95 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 2.0 to 5.0 percent.  Based on observations during the spring snowmelt period the layers above the duripan are saturated for 20 or more consecutive days in April through June; (Oxyaquic).
