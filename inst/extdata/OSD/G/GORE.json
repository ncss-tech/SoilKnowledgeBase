  "OVERVIEW": "The Gore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick clayey fluvial sediments on Pleistocene age terraces.  Slope is dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but ranges to as much as 20 percent near escarpments that are adjacent to drainageways. Mean annual air temperature is about 17.0 degrees C (63 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1303 mm (51.3 in).",
