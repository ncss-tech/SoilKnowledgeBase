Content of coarse fragments in the solum ranges from none to 15 percent. The 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and has more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A and AB horizons are black or very dark gray.\nThe BAg and Bg horizons are dark gray or gray in hue of 2.5Y or 5Y with prominent reddish brown or yellowish red redox concentrations.\nThe Cg horizon is gray or light gray, and from clay loam to silty clay.  Depth to very gravelly material exceeds 40 inches.  Pumice grains are present throughout the 10 to 40 inch control section, but the content does not exceed 10 percent."
