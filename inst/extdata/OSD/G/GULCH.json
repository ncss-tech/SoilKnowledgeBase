  "OVERVIEW": "The Gulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium from mixed sources.   Gulch soils are on stream terraces, fan terraces, and relict basin floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
