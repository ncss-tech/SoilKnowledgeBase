When effervescent, it is the result of eolian carbonate recharge.\nE horizon\nOther features: This horizon, when present, meets a criterion for albic materials and qualifies as an albic horizon.\nBt and Btk horizons\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4.\nTexture: Sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of loam or sandy clay loam.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Few or common fine bodies of segregated carbonate in filaments, seams, or coats on rock fragments.\nEffervescence: Noneffervescent in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent in the lower part of the argillic horizon on bodies of segregated carbonate.  The matrix of some pedons is noneffervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.\nBk and C horizons\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4.\nTexture: Stratified coarse sandy loam to very gravelly coarse sand.\nClay content: 2 to 8 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages 5 to 35 percent, subhorizons range from 5 to 50 percent, mainly fine gravel.\nConsistence: Slightly hard or hard dry, very friable or friable moist.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Bk horizons have carbonate coats on undersides of gravel and few or common fine filaments throughout the horizons or as small pockets within parts of the horizons.\nEffervescence: Bk horizons are slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.  C horizons are noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brinkerhoff, Chacoan, Delp, Enos, Glotrain, Mayqueen, Shiprock, Wallson, and Woolsey series.\nBrinkerhoff soils have gypsum at 50 cm. Chacoan and Enos soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Delp soils have an argillic horizon composed of lamellae and are slightly or strongly effervescent in the series control section. Glowtrain soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to summer convection storms. Mayqueen soils have less than 25 percent coarse sand and do not have carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Shiprock soils are fine sandy loam or sandy loam to 150 cm.  Wallson soils are sandy loam or fine sandy loam to 150 cm and do not have Btk horizons.  Woolsey soils are dominantly sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam to 150 cm and are effervescent throughout the series control section."
