  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Govwash soils are on summits of dissected pediments.  These soils formed in alluvium (pedisediment) derived from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks and basalt. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,300 to 2,200 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
