  "OVERVIEW": "The Govwash series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks and basalt. Govwash soils are on dissected pediments. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,300 to 2,200 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
