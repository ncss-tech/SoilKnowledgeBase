  "OVERVIEW": "The Gomine series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium dominantly from igneous rocks.  Gomine soils are on ridgetops and mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",

Bocker and Nayrib soils are less than 25 cm to bedrock.  Cedaran soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.  Falula, Rexmont and Swanner soils are calcareous."
