  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Grosstown soils were previously mapped as Aura, Chillum, Croom and Sassafras soils, and were also mapped as miscellaneous land types.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 183 cm (Bt horizons)\nParticle size control section--the zone from 10 to 61 cm\nLithologic Discontinuity-abrupt change in fine and coarse silt, and gravel content at 66 cm (2Bt3 horizon)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 200 cm\nLaboratory data indicates a base saturation (by sum of cations) of greater than 35 percent in the type location pedon. The high base status in this soil is thought to be the result of long-time cropping practices (liming) and not from the presence of native base cations. This soil will revert back to a lower base status if a liming schedule is not maintained.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for this pedon (S01MD017-014) is available from the NSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
