  "OVERVIEW": "The Gowker series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on flood plains.  They formed in loamy and clayey alluvium.  The slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges between 28 and 35 percent, with clay strata commonly occurring within some part of the control section.\nThe A1 and A2 horizons have colors in hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam with some pedons containing thin strata of finer or coarser textures and range from medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe A3 horizon has colors in hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe B horizons have colors in hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Mottles in shades of brown range from few to common.  Textures range from clay, clay loam, or sandy clay, to sandy clay loam or loam.  Stratification of fine sandy loam or sand ranges from none to common.\nThe C horizons range from medium acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Arrington,  Bosque, Cannon, Elbon, Gowen, Gowton, Kanebreak and Staser series.  The Arrington soils have fine-silty control sections.  Bosque and Gowen soils are dry for longer periods and have ustic moisture regimes.  Cannon soils contain 15 to 30 percent coarse fragments in all horizons and have mixed mineralogy.\nElbon soils have thinner mollic epipedons and are in a fine family.  Gowton soils lack slowly permeable clay layers in the control section and have mixed mineralogy. Kanebreak soils are wet for longer periods of time and have aquic moisture regimes. Staser soils contain mica flakes, are moist for longer periods of time, and have mixed mineralogy."
