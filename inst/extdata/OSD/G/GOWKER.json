  "OVERVIEW": "The Gowker series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains of river valleys and dissected plains.  Slope range is 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1117.6 mm (44 in).",
