  "OVERVIEW": "The Gromes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from metamorphic and igneous rock.  Gromes soils are on mountain sideslopes and mountain tops.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
