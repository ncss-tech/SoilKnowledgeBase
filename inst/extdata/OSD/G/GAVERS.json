  "OVERVIEW": "The Gavers series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in Loess up to 40 inches thick,colluvium and in residuum from Pennsylvanian age acid shale, siltstone, clayey shale and some limestone on base slopes. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the Loess and moderately slow or slow in the underlying material. Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51\ndegrees F.",
