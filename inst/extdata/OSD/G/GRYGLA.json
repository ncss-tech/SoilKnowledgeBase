  "OVERVIEW": "The Grygla series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sands over glacial till, under forest vegetation. They have rapid permeability in the upper sediments and moderate or moderately slow in the glacial till. These soils are on slightly concave areas on glacial lake plains. Slopes are less than 2 percent. The mean air annual temperature is 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the sandy lacustrine  mantle and depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The upper sediment averages less than 5 percent rock fragments, but the lower few inches in some pedons has as much as 35 percent rock fragments as a lag line. The glacial till has 1 to 15 percent rock fragments. The rock fragments are mixed in lithology.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, value of 4 or 5 dry. The A horizon typically is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. The epipedon is less than 6 inches thick where the texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. In some pedons the A horizon may contain sufficient organic matter for a mucky modifier.The A horizon is slightly acid or neutral.  A stony surface phase is also recognized.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 10YR  through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has redoximorphic features in all parts. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg, 2BCkg, 2CBkg or 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has  has redoximorphic features in all parts.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg, 2BCkg, 2CBkg or 2Cg horizon in the Percy till phase has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe 2Bkg, 2BCkg, 2CBkg or 2Cg horizon in the Des Moines till phase has textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It has 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Moist bulk density  ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc."

They formed in 20 to 40 inches of mostly sandy glaciolacustrine sediments over loamy, calcareous, glacial till. The lacustrine sediments are of Glacial Lake Agassiz origin and the till is Late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88to135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1350 feet."

The very poorly drained Berner and Northwood soils are formed in organic over mineral material and sit slightly lower on the landscape. Chilgren soils are found in similar landscape positions and are formed entirely in glacial till. The moderately well drained Eckvoll and Enstrom soils formed in similar sediments and are on slightly higher landscape positions."

Permeability is rapid in the upper sediment and moderate or moderately slow in the lower sediment. Depth to seasonal high saturation is as high as 0.5 foot for the poorly drained phase and at the surface for the very poorly drained phase during the months of April to July in normal years. In addtion, the very poorly drained phase will have ponding during periods of heavy rain or snowmelt."

Native vegetation is mixed or alternating prairie and forest. Major species of trees are quaking aspen, balsam poplar, willow , alder, black spruce and black ash."
