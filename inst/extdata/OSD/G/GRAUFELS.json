  "OVERVIEW": "The Graufels series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Graufels soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
