The soil between the depths of 8 to 22 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15 and moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30 in 6 or more years out of 10. Mineralogy is halloysitic and is strongly influenced by amourphous properties.  Base saturation is 40 to 70 percent (sum of cations) throughout.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4; 10YR 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 5YR 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; or 10YR 3/4.  It is very gravelly loam occurring as a surface pavement in the upper A horizon.  The lower A horizon is gravelly loam.  Gravel content is 40 to 90 percent at the surface and 15 to 35 percent in the lower A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/6, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4, or 5/6.   It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay, clay loam or clay. Gravel content is 5 to 35 percent.  Coarse and very coarse sand is 5 to 20 percent.  Clay content is 30 to 50 percent, and the weighted average in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 50 percent.
