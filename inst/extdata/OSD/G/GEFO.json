    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gefo soils are on nearly level to moderately steep glacial outwash terraces and alluvial fans at elevations of 1830 to 2135 meters. They formed in sandy alluvium and glacial outwash derived mainly from granitic rocks. The climate is cool continental. Mean annual precipitation varies from 510 to 1145 milimeters, much of which occurs as snow. The mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 degrees C., mean July temperature is 16 degrees C. The average frost-free season is about 40 to 100 days."
