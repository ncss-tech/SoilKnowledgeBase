  "OVERVIEW": "The Gefo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed on glacial outwash and alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks. Gefo soils are on outwash terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 762 mm and mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",

They formed in sandy alluvium and glacial outwash derived mainly from granitic rocks. The climate is cool continental. Mean annual precipitation varies from 510 to 1145 milimeters, much of which occurs as snow. The mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 degrees C., mean July temperature is 16 degrees C. The average frost-free season is about 40 to 100 days."
