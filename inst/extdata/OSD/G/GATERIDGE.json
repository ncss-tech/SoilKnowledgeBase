  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly ironstone and sandstone channers and flagstones.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has 40 to 55 percent clay with less than 25 percent more clay than the overlying Bt horizon. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Cr is soft sandstone interbedded with soft shale.  It may contain a few ironstone fragments.  It is frequently more than 10 feet thick."

They formed in residuum derived dominantly from noncalcareous sandstone and shale.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches and is supplemented by heavy snowpack in most areas."
