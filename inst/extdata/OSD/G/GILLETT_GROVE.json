Based on MLRA correlation, soils that formed 40 to 60 inches of loess over glacial till will be correlated to this series. Soils that formed more than 60 inches of loess will be correlated to the Marcus series.  This type location was previously the type location for the Marcus series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
