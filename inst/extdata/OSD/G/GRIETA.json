  "OVERVIEW": "The Grieta series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in eolian sediments on ridges, fan terraces, plateaus and mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
