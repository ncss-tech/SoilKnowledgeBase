Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in horizons above 20 inches and from 5 to 35 percent in horizons between 20 to 40 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper horizons and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline within 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture ranges from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bg has a hue 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or prismatic.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma 3 or 4. Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or prismatic.\nThe C or 2C has a hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Textures are loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or massive with weak stratification."

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in water-sorted material which ranges widely in texture among layers below 20 inches. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 43 inches, mean annual air temperature from 40 to 44 degrees F., and mean growing season from 90 to 130 days."
