  "REVDATE": "03/1999",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gulf series consists of deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in water-sorted materials. They are on outwash plains, terraces and kame-kettle landforms. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Average annual precipitation is 39 inches, average annual air temperature is 42 degrees F., and average growing season is 115 days.",
