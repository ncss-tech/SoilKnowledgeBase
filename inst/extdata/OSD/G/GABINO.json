  "OVERVIEW": "The Gabino series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from softly consolidated gravelly and cobbly sandy deposits. Gabino soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 24 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. at depth of 20 inches and the soil temperature is usually not below 46 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of about 6 and 16 inches is continuously dry in all parts from late April or May until late October or November and is usually moist in some part or all the rest of the year.  The soil usually contains pebbles or cobbles or both throughout and has from 10 to 30 percent (by volume) in both the A and B2t horizons.  These soils have 1 to 4 percent organic matter to depth of 10 inches and the amount decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at depth of about 15 inches.  Base saturation is between 80 and 100 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is brown or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3) gravelly or cobbly loam or clay loam.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure, parting to weak subangular blocky.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard and is medium or slightly acid.  Some pedons have horizons transitional to the B2t horizon and have either B1 or A3 horizons or both.\nThe B2t horizon is dark reddish gray or reddish brown (5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3) gravelly or cobbly clay or gravelly or cobbly sandy clay.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and generally increases in alkalinity as depth increases."

Solano soils have natric horizons with less than 35 percent clay and lack rock fragments.  Yorba soils lack mollic epipedons and have B2t horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments."
