  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 24 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. at depth of 20 inches and the soil temperature is usually not below 46 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of about 6 and 16 inches is continuously dry in all parts from late April or May until late October or November and is usually moist in some part or all the rest of the year.  The soil usually contains pebbles or cobbles or both throughout and has from 10 to 30 percent (by volume) in both the A and B2t horizons.  These soils have 1 to 4 percent organic matter to depth of 10 inches and the amount decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at depth of about 15 inches.  Base saturation is between 80 and 100 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is brown or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3) gravelly or cobbly loam or clay loam.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure, parting to weak subangular blocky.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard and is medium or slightly acid.  Some pedons have horizons transitional to the B2t horizon and have either B1 or A3 horizons or both.\nThe B2t horizon is dark reddish gray or reddish brown (5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3) gravelly or cobbly clay or gravelly or cobbly sandy clay.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and generally increases in alkalinity as depth increases."

Los Osos and Sween soils have B horizon hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Sespe soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the solum, and have 7.5YR or 5YR hue in the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in softly consolidated gravelly and cobbly sandy deposits.  The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with warm, somewhat foggy, dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F., average July temperature is about 69 to 74 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 290 to 350 days."

Modjeska and Soboba soils lack mollic epipedons and B2t horizons and both have 35 percent or more rock fragments.  Solano soils have natric horizons with less than 35 percent clay and lack rock fragments.  Yorba soils lack mollic epipedons and have B2t horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments."
