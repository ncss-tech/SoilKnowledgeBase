    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to basalt is 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The control section has 40 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  It is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 when moist, 3 to 5 when dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry and moist.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Structure is moderate to strong.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 when moist, 4 or 5 when dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when moist and dry.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent gravel.  Structure is subangular blocky or prismatic and is moderate to strong.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 4 to 6 when dry and chroma of 2 to 4 when moist and dry.  It is very or extremely cobbly clay.  It has 20 to 50 percent cobbles and 10 to 30 percent gravel.  Clay films are few to many and thin to thick.  Structure is moderate to strong."

The soils formed in loess over residuum from basalt mixed with small amounts of volcanic ash.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
