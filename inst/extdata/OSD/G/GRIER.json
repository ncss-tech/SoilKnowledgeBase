  "REVDATE": "09/2023",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grier series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvial materials associated with the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on level to nearly level playa benches. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual temperature is about 16 C (61 degrees F)",

Vegetation includes alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, joint tail, sedge and rushes, inland saltgrass and occasionally some western wheatgrass. Forbs includes portulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs. Woody species include salt cedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species. In areas of standing water, cattails may be present. The established plant community may fluctuate due mainly to the degree of salinity and the hydrology. This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (077CY689TX) range site in MLRA-77C."
