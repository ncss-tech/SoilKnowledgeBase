  "OVERVIEW": "The Grable series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 45 to 80 centimeters of calcareous silty alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.",
