  "OVERVIEW": "The Grayslake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in organic material of water-tolerant plants. Grayslake soils are in bogs of mountain basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.",
