  "OVERVIEW": "The Grangeville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in moderate coarse textured alluvium dominantly from granitic rock sources.  Grangeville soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 8 and 24 inches is continuously dry from May or early June until November or early December.  In most years under natural conditions, the soils are saturated within 25 to 40 inches of the surface for several months or more, usually about January to April.  Additional effective moisture is added through dense ground fog in the San Joaquin Valley.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is stratified and averages less than 18 percent clay by weight and has more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.  Organic matter is 1.5 to 6 percent in the upper 10 inches and averages less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  The organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; 5Y 4/1 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 3/3; 5Y 3/1 or 3/2.  It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, light loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  The A horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline in saline-sodic phases.  Some pedons are effervescent at the surface. In saline-sodic phases the sodium adsorption ratio is always less than 13 in this horizon.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2; 5Y 5/1, 5/2, 6/2 or 6/3.  Faint to prominent redoximorphic masses of iron are present.  This horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, light loam or light silt loam.  It has weak structure or is massive.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline in saline-sodic phases.  In most pedons, some or all of this horizon is calcareous with carbonates mostly disseminated, but in some pedons fine carbonate segregations are present. Carbonates range from 0 to 5 percent. In some pedons the B horizon is absent.\nThe C horizon is similar to the B horizon in most features but includes dry color of 10YR 8/1, 7/2, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3, or 5/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 5/1, or 6/1 and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 7/1.  It is stratified loamy sand to silt loam, clay content is 8 to 18 percent, and colors are very variable.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline and slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline in saline-sodic phases.  Carbonates usually decrease from the B horizon but always by less than 5 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grangeville soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains at elevations of 0 to 1800 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium dominantly derived from granitic rock sources.  Some areas are saline and saline-sodic affected.  Many areas have been reclaimed.  The climate is dry subhumid with hot dry summer and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation, all in the form of rain, is 7 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 64 degrees F., mean January temperature is 45 degrees to 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is 72 degrees to 80 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 300 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; this soil has altered drainage because of the dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, pumping from the water table, tile and interceptor drains, and filling and leveling of sloughs in the vicinity. negligible to very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability and moderate permeability in saline-sodic phases.  Formerly most areas of Grangeville soils were occasionally flooded, but now stream flow is controlled by large flood control structures to the extent that most areas are not flooded more than once in about 25 to 75 years.  The water table is at depths of 24 to 48 inches unless drained.  If drained, the water table is at depths of 48 to greater than 60 inches. (See Remarks)"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The description of the Foster series has not been recently revised and differentiation of the two soils is not clearly defined.  Foster soils are assumed to have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Pumping of ground water and changes in season and volume of stream flow has greatly changed the moisture regime of many areas classified as Grangeville soil in the past.  It is doubtful that many areas are any longer saturated within 40 inches of the surface.  The Bg horizon is considered by some observers to be a C horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap).\nFluvaquentic subgroup - organic carbon decreases irregularly with increasing depth.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
