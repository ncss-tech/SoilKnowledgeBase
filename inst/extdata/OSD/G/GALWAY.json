  "OVERVIEW": "The Galway series consists of moderately deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in till. They are nearly level to very steep soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep over calcareous sedimentary bedrock. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 18 to 30 inches and depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments, by volume, range from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon, 3 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 5 to 70 percent in the C horizon. The soil is moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon, moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the B horizon, and slightly or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. The structure is fine to coarse granular or fine or medium subangular blocky. The consistence is very friable or friable. The A horizon has a thickness of 2 to 5 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Faint or distinct mottles or redoximorphic concentrations with chroma higher than 2 occur in the lower part of some pedons. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate, fine through coarse, subangular blocky or granular structure. Consistence ranges from very friable to firm.\nBC horizon, if present, is similar to the Bw but differs by having free carbonates and chroma as low as 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. If chroma is 2, the value is 4 or more. It ranges from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It is friable or firm. It is calcareous in some part.\nThe 2R horizon is limestone, dolomitic limestone, or calcareous sandstone bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Nellis, Salter, and Sunburg soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.\nThe Amenia, Benson, Farmington, Hogansburg, and Wassaic series are similar soils in related families. Amenia and Hogansburg soils have mottles with chroma of 2 within a depth of 25 inches and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Benson and Farmington soils have bedrock at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Wassaic soils have an argillic horizon."

Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soil has lithic contact, at 20 to 40 inches, of nearly horizontally bedded sedimentary rocks containing lime. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.; and the mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 95 to 1000 feet above sea level."
