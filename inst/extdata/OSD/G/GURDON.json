  "OVERVIEW": "The Gurdon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium high in silt. These soils are on Pleistocene terraces in the Western Coastal Plain, MLRA 133B. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).",
