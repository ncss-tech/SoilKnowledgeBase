  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenmora series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on high terraces of river valleys on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1473 mm (58 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
