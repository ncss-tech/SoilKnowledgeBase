Anthony and Rucker soils are coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the control section.  Excelsior and Victorville soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Grabe and Rucker soils contain more than 1 percent organic matter in the surface and are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a higher rainfall component.  Ireteba soils contain horizons of distinct calcium carbonate accumulations.  Junction and Tobler soils have hue redder than 7.5YR.  Popson soils are inactive."
