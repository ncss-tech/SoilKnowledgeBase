    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has a bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cm3 and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 3.0 percent.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 t0 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is medial silt loam and has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent paragravel.  Organic matter is 8 to 12 percent.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel with 0 to 10 percent paragravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or cobbly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 5 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent paragravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grassyknob soils occur in open grassland areas on broad ridgetops, stable benches, and south-facing side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 1,300 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."

All of these soils occur on broad ridgetops or side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Hooskanaden, Loneranch, Reinhart, and Sebastian soils occur in open grassland areas.  All the other soils are forested.  Hooskanaden soils are very deep to bedrock, clayey, and somewhat poorly drained. Loneranch soils are moderately well drained and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less below 20 inches.  Millicoma soils are loamy-skeletal and 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Reinhart soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Sebastian soils are loamy-skeletal, 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock, and have serpentinitic mineralogy.  Whaleshead soils are very deep and loamy-skeletal."
