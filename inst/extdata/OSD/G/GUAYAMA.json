    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured unconsolidated rock ranges from 11 to 18 inches. Depth to hard consolidated bedrock ranges from 15 to 20 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 20 to 55 percent, by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction. Content of paragravels and paracobbles range from 25 to 65 percent, by volume.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay loam or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated basalt, chert or rhyolite. It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured basalt, chert or rhyolite bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum and colluvium material weathered from basalt, chert and rhyolite.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 37 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 82 to 86 degrees F."

Bermeja (T) soils are on similar positions but do not have an argillic horizon.  Maguayo soils are on alluvial fans, are very deep and have clayey subsoils."

The classification was updated with the 11/2004 draft from Clayey, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Lithic Haplustalfs to Clayey, mixed, active, isohyperthermic, shallow Typic Haplustalfs based on the recognition of a paralithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; S61PR-079-003.
