  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "10/2005",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guayama series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes and summits of hills and mountains of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum and colluvium material weathered from basalt, chert and rhyolite.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 84 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches. Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured unconsolidated rock ranges from 11 to 18 inches. Depth to hard consolidated bedrock ranges from 15 to 20 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 20 to 55 percent, by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction. Content of paragravels and paracobbles range from 25 to 65 percent, by volume.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay loam or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated basalt, chert or rhyolite. It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured basalt, chert or rhyolite bedrock."

The classification was updated with the 11/2004 draft from Clayey, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Lithic Haplustalfs to Clayey, mixed, active, isohyperthermic, shallow Typic Haplustalfs based on the recognition of a paralithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; S61PR-079-003.  Sample by NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 03/1961.\nGuayama soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
