    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 13 inches thick.  The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the particle size control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  These soils are slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous in the A horizon.\nThe A and ABt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  They range from gravelly, very gravelly and extremely gravelly sandy loam to gravelly, very gravelly and extremely gravelly clay loam, very stony loam and very cobbly loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from very gravelly and very cobbly loamy sand to very gravelly, very cobbly sandy clay loam, very stony loam, very cobbly loam, and very cobbly fine sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
