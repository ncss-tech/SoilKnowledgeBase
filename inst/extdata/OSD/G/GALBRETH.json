These soils formed in material derived from consolidated sandstone.  The climate is characterized by cool, with cold, dry winters; moist springs; and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 115 to 135 days."
