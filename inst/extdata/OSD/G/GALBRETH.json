Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 7 to 13 inches (Bw horizon); consolidated sandstone at 13 inches (Cr1 horizon).  Borollic Camborthids feature an ochric epipedon and a cambic horizon.  Galbreth soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic and have a frigid temperature regime."
