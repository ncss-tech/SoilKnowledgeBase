    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Sodhouse, Tybo, and Univega series.\nSodhouse soils have cambic horizons and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in July to October.  Tybo soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the Bk horizon.  Univega soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  In addition, all of these soils lack bedrock within 100 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Garhill soils are on hills, rock pediments, plateaus, and mesas formed by basalt flows.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt with surficial deposits of eolian volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,370 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the Bk horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 23 to 58 cm (2Bqkm horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 58 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (2R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 23 cm (A1, A2, and Bk horizons).\nFuture study of this series is needed to determine the amount of volcanic ash influence in the A horizons.  Based on lab data from adjacent soils there is a strong possibility that volcanic glass contents in the A horizons are much greater than 30 percent.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Other authors and editors include: EWB-WED-RLB.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
