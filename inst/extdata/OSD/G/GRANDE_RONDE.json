  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, and it is dry for less than 60 consecutive days in all parts between 4 and 12 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 47 to 55 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum above the IIC horizon ranges from 22 to 36 inches. The A horizon has 10YR hue, value near 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 and no or few faint or distinct mottles. The B horizons has 10YR hue, value of 4 through 6 moist and 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. Mottles having chroma ranging from 1 to 6 are distinct or prominent at depths of less than 20 inches. Texture ranges from silty clay to clay, and the structure is weak or moderate grade. The IIC horizon is structureless, massive or has weak prismatic structure. In some places it contains fragments of siltstone and shale, and pebbles of basalt.  These fragments and pebbles usually are most abundant in the deepest horizons, where they constitute as much as 20 percent of the soil by volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Grande Ronde soils are on nearly level old terraces in small valleys along the eastern footslopes of the Coast Range at elevations of 300 to 500 feet. The regolith is stratified silty clay loam, sitly clay, and clay that have come mainly from sedimentary rocks. Winter is cool and moist and summer is warm and dry. The average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 34 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 80 inches. The growing season is about 180 days."
