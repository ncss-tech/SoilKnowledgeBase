  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the solum is the same or is less than depth to rock.  Rock fragments make up 3 to 30 percent of the soil.  Mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the temperature does not go below 41 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 4 and 12 inches is dry by May 15 or June 1 and is continuously dry until late October or early November.  Part of all of the soil in this section is moist all the rest of the year.  The solum is mainly moderately acid to neutral throughout, tends to become less acid with depth and is moderately alkaline in some pedons just above the bedrock.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout the solum.  Organic matter is 2 to 6 percent in the A horizon and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at a depth of 18 inches.  The particle-size control section has less than 30 percent sand content.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2, 4/2, 3/2; 5YR 5/4, 5/3, or 4/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2 or 3/3 (see remarks).  It is loam or light clay loam and has moderate or strong granular or subangular blocky structure.  An AB or BA horizon up to 6 inches thick is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4, 3/2, 3/3, or 3/4.  7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, or 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 3/2 (see remarks).  The lower part of the Bt horizon commonly has lighter colors and in some pedons the dry value or chroma is 6.  It is clay loam with 5 to 8 percent more clay, absolute, than the A horizon and has 27 to 35 percent total clay content.  There are few to many thin to thick clay films on peds and in pores.  The structure varies from weak to strong angular or subangular blocky.  A BC horizon or C horizon or both are present in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ballard, Bohna, Chualar, Pinto, Sagaser, Shimmon, Soper, and Tehachapi series.  Ballard, Chualar, Pinto, Soper, and Tehachapi soils lack a lithic or paralithic contact.  Bohna soils have a paralithic contact of weathered granitic bedrock at depths of 40 to 73 inches.  Sagaser soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Shimmon soils have a paralithic contact at depths 20 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in material weathered from basic igneous and metabasic rocks.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature is about 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 68 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 300 days."

Henneke soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments and are less than 20 inches deep to serpentine rock.  Los Gatos soils have a mean soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.
