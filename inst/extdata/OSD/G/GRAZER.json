The moisture control section of 7 to 21 inches is moist from January 1 to May 1 and dry from June 1 to October 15 in most years. The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F from February 15 to December 15. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/1 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4 or 5/4. Organic matter content is 0.8 to 2 percent. Clay content is 30 to 40 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has color of 10YR 5/6, 6/1, 6/2, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4or 2.5Y 4/2. Organic matter content is 0.7 to 1 percent. Texture is silty clay or clay. Clay content is 40 to 55 percent and it contains at least 8 percent more total clay than the A horizon. BA and BC transitional horizons occur in most pedons and have properties similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe Cr horizon consists of weathered marine calcareous shale."

Belgarra soils on erosional fan remnants on mountains, have a gypsic horizon and do not have a paralithic contact. Borreguero soils, on mountains, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and have a loamy particle-size control section. Exclose soils, on mountains, do not have a paralithic contact and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Gewter soils, on hills, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 30 inches and reaction of extremely acid to moderately acid. Getrail soils, have intersecting slickensides and have a mesic soil temperature regime. Monvero soils, on dune fields on mountains, have a sandy particle-size control section."
