  "REVDATE": "02/2006",
  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenbriar series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of silty material and residuum weathered from acid shales and siltstones.  Permeability is moderate.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on upland ridges, side slopes, and toeslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 46 inches and the average annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the upper solum and from 0 to 35 percent in the lower solum and substratum.  Rock fragments are mostly weathered and unweathered shale or siltstone.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid throughout the profile, except where limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4, but to a depth of 7 inches after mixing the Ap has value moist of 4 or more.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam or their channery analogue in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  In some pedons the Bt horizon is mottled horizon or has mottles or both in shades of brown, yellow, or red and in the lower part shades of gray.\nThe BC or CB horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, and their channery analogue.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay, and their channery analogue.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is weathered shale.\nThe R horizon is hard fissile shale."

Chillum soils have a thinner solum, Fletcher so11s formed in residuum weathered in phyllite, and Jessietown soils formed in similar materials to the Greenbriar series but are less than 40 inches to hard bedrock.  Kurtz soils formed over soft bedrock.  Talleyville soils formed in a silty mantle underlain by residuum weathered from igneous rock.  Wernock soils are less than 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Whitley soils occur on stream terraces, fans, and toe slopes and formed in old mixed alluvium or colluvium."
