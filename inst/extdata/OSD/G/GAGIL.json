    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gagil soils are on sideslopes and ridgetops of uplands.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in residuum derived from highly weathered volcanic breccia and tuff.  Elevation ranges form 3 to 197 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F., and does not vary by more than 34 degrees F from month to month.  Mean annual maximum temperature is 88 degrees F., and mean annual minimum is 75 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall is about 122 inches and varies from about 90 to 149 inches from year to year with the driest months of February, March, and April averaging 6 inches per month."

Gitam, Rumung, and Weloy soils are underlain by schist, have an argillic horizon, and a high base saturation.  Yap soils have a higher organic-matter content, base saturation, fertility status, and are typically under broadleaf evergreen forest vegetation."
