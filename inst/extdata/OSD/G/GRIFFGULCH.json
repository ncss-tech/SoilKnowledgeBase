  "OVERVIEW": "The Griffgulch series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metavolcanic rocks.  Griffgulch soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches, (1422 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, (13 degrees C).",
