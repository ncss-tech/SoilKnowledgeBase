  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenway series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sediments and the underlying firm clay loam glacial till.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the soil and slow in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The soil typically contains 0 to 5 percent by volume of pebbles, cobbles, and stones, and a few boulders.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It commonly is loam, but some pedons are silt loam.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are loam or clay loam and average 20 to 30 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is sandy loam but is loamy sand or sandy clay loam in some pedons.  Tongues of the Bt3 horizon extend into the upper part of the 2Bt4 horizon.

Bullflat soils have more rock fragments in the substratum and are formed in alluvial colluvial material, Dooley soils formed in alluvial or aeolian sediments over glacial till, contain more sand in the solum, and do not have genetic horizon development into the underlying glacial till.  Empedrado and Martinsdale soils typically contain more sand and less clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Fairfield soils formed in alluvium and are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon.  Farnuf soils formed in alluvium and lack IIB2t horizons. Felor soils formed in loamy sediments overlying clayey sediments and have less sand in the 2B and 2C horizons.  Gurney soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over rock.  Hangdo, Trag soils have carbonate accumulations below a depth of 40 inches.  Lefor, Lininger and Reeder soils are underlaid by a paralithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Livona soils contain more sand in the upper part of the control section and less clay in the lower part.  Moen and Watrous have a lithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches.   Vida soils formed in glacial till and are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon.  Wemple soils formed in sediments high in volcanic ash.  Williams soils do not have 2Bt horizons and have less clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon and typically less clay in the C horizon within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Williams soils tend to be more permeable and have less firm consistence throughout the series control section.  Yegen soils contain more sand in series control section and lack 2Bt2t horizons."
