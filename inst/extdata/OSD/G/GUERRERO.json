Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where value is 3, it is less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5, and chroma higher than 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, and gray range from few to many.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy clay or clay."

The moderately well drained Jobos soils are on lower positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches thick, and have more clay in the subsoil.  Maleza soils are on similar to lower positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches thick, have redder and more clay in the subsoils, and lack plinthite.  The somewhat excessively drained Rio Lajas soils are on lower positions, have Umbric epipedons, have less clay in the subsoil, and lack plinthite."
