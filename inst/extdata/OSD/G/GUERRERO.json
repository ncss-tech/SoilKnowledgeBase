  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Guerrero series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands and terraces of the coastal plain.  They formed in regolith that consists of coarse deposits over fine-textured sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
