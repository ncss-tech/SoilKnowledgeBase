  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gazelle series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained, alkaline soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources of the Cascade and Klamath Mountain Ranges.  Gazelle soils are in basins and on basin terraces and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 20 to 40 inches deep to a massive or laminar, strongly cemented or indurated lime-silica duripan.  After acid digestion silica cemented laminar plates or seams remain.  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 57 degrees F.; the mean January soil temperature ls 35 to 38 degrees F.; the mean July soil temperature is 64 to 79 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 1 to December 20 and more than 47 degrees F. from April to November 25.  The soil between the depths of 8 to 20 inches is dry in all parts from August 1 to September 30 and moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The E.C. ranges from 4 to 6 mmhos/cm and the SAR ranges from 2 to 8.  The soil is moderately to very strongly alkaline and is slightly to violently effervescent.  The carbonates are mostly disseminated.\nThe A horizon is gray, light gray, light brownish gray, pale brown, light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 7/2).  Moist colors are dark grayish brown, brown, gray, grayish brown or pale brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2).  It is sandy silt loam with 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon above the duripan ranges from light gray to very pale brown and white (10YR 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 8/1, 8/3; 2.5Y 7/2, 8/2; 5Y 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 8/1, 8/2).  Moist colors are similar to dry colors and in addition it is gray, light brownish gray, or light olive gray (10YR 6/1, 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 6/1, 6/2).  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with 8 to 18 percent clay.\nTypically the duripan consists of laminar plates or layers cemented by silica, or lime and silica.  In some pedons the duripan consists of durinodes cemented together.  It is massive and is very hard or extremely hard when dry.\nBelow the duripan the substratum is stratified and is quite variable.  It ranges from sandy loam to silty clay loam and has up to 15 percent rock fragments in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gazelle soils are in basins and on basin terraces and low terraces with slightly undulating or hummocky relief.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, volcanic dust and metasedimentary rocks.  The soil are mapped in areas with small spots of highly saline or saline-alkali slicks that lack vegetation.  Some spots have salt crusts in the surface.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,500 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 25 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 15 to 24 inches.   Mean January temperature s 33 to 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature s 68 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Louie soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and are well drained.  Pit soils are clayey and have cracks that extend to the surface.  Salisbury soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine textured argillic horizon."
