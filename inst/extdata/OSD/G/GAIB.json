  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite, basalt, rhyolite, or welded rhyolitic tuff. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, most of which falls as snow and spring rain. The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
