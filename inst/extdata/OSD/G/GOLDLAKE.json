  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 28 inches thick. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.25 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.    The particle-size control section is 8 to 15 percent clay and 10 to 25 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Depth to densic material is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Structure is strong or moderate granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam in the upper part,and loam or sandy loam in the lower part.  It contains 10 to 30 percent pebbles, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is gravelly-ranging to very gravelly below 40 inches in some pedons. It is 15 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Moist bulk density is 1.70 to 2.00 with an RV of 1.85 g/cc."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Donavan, Phoebe, Spokane, Stevens, and Usk series.  Donavan soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days and have a Cd horizon in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Phoebe and Stevens soils lack mottles in the control section.  In addition Phoebe soils are sandy in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Spokane and Usk soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldlake soils are in swales and draws of glaciated uplands with moraine topography.  These soils formed in glacial till from mixed sources,with a component of loess, volcanic ash, and slope alluvium in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
