  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sand and gravel ranges from 40 to 60 inches and it is typically stratified.  Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 48 inches and extends into the Bw horizon of most pedons.  Depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 25 to 60 inches.  The control section is silty clay loam or silt loam and averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay and between 3 and 15 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, or silt loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam but is loam in the lower part in some pedons.  It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nA Bk or C horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe 2C or 2Bk horizon typically has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sand but is loamy sand or sand in some pedons and contains 10 to 50 percent gravel by volume.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  When present, the 2Bk horizon is charaterized by having carbonate coatings on the underside of pebbles."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Duroc, Eltree, Trent, and Viborg, and Yankton series.  Similar soils are the Alcester, Bon, Brocksburg, Davis, Dempster, Enet, Flandreau, and Hord series.  Duroc soils are dry for longer periods.  Eltree soils have free calcium carbonate within 15 inches of the surface.  Trent soils have distinct or prominent mottles between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Viborg soils contain more fine or coarser sand in the lower part of the control section.  Yankton soils do not have sand and gravel in the substratum.  Alcester and Hord soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter.  Bon and Davis soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Brocksburg soils have sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have an argillic horizon.  Dempster and Enet soils have sand and gravel at depths of 20 and 40 inches. Flandreau soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have a fine-loamy control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Graceville soils are nearly level in swales or in slightly depressed flats that have concave or plane surfaces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium overlying outwash sand and gravel on glacial stream terraces and outwash plains.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches, and the mean air annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F."
