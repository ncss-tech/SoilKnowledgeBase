  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Granidry soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on south-facing backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Granhogany soils are sandy-skeletal, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and have a frigid temperature regime.  Lockgate soils have thick mollic epipedons, are deep to paralithic contacts, and have a frigid temperature regime."
