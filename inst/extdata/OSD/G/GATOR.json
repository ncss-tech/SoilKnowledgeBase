  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The pH is 4.5 or more in 0.01 M calcium chloride in at least some part of the organic materials in the control section.  Some parts can be as acid as pH 3.6.  The pH is 6.1 to 7.8 by the Hellige-Troug method in the Oa horizon. The reaction is very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg1 horizon, and strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the underlying horizons.\nThickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 50 inches.  Depth to loamy material is less than 51 inches.  The Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract colors have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 4 or less, or value of 5, and chroma or 2 to 4, or value of 6 chroma of 3 or 4.  Electrical conductivity in areas of saline seeps is more than 16.\nThe Cg1 and Cg2 horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sandy clay loam,  loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Thin strata of sandy clay may be present.  Organic matter content is less than 20 percent.  In some pedons there is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand 4 to 15 inches thick immediately below the Oa horizon.  Where present, it is underlain by a layer of sandy clay loam sufficiently thick to qualify for a loamy family.  The Cg2 horizon commonly is stratified with loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or fine sand.  Electrical conductivity may range from 0 to 8 in the upper part and from 2 to 4 in the lower part in areas of saline seeps.\nThe Cg3 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  The texture is primarily fine sand, sand, or loamy sand, but may include strata of sandy loam and sandy clay loam.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 4 in areas of saline seeps.  Fragments of shell and/or soft masses of calcium carbonate may be present."
