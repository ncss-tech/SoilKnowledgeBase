  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bristolake (CA) and Sheephole (CA) series. Both soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 22 to 25 degrees C, and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September following summer convection storms. In addition, Bristolake soils are at least moderately alkaline in the surface horizon and have an electrical conductivity (EC) of 4 to 16 dS/m and an SAR of 5 to 12 throughout most of the particle-size control section. Sheephole soils are formed in eolian material overlying alluvium with less than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle size control section."

Elevations range from 300 to 835 meters (984 to 2,740 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (73 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."
