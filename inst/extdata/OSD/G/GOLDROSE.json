  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldrose series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. The Goldrose soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (3 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 24.5 degrees C (76 degrees F).",

Both soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 22 to 25 degrees C, and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September following summer convection storms. In addition, Bristolake soils are at least moderately alkaline in the surface horizon and have an electrical conductivity (EC) of 4 to 16 dS/m and an SAR of 5 to 12 throughout most of the particle-size control section. Sheephole soils are formed in eolian material overlying alluvium with less than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle size control section."
