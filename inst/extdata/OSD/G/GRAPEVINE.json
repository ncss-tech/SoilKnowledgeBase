All these soils lack gypsum influence.  Algerita soils have control sections with 10 to 20 percent carbonate clay.  Cronese soils do not have gypsum in the lower substratum and have 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Guijarral soils are dry from April to January. Kinley and Rillino soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control sections. Nikey soils have a calcic horizon at depths below 50 centimeters (20 inches) and contain more than 20 percent gravel.  Whitlock soils have calcic horizons at depths of 25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches). Wink soils have calcic horizons at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches). Yippin soils have  calcic horizons at 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grapevine soils are on fan piedmonts and alluvial flats. These soils formed in mixed alluvium with some gypsum. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 520 to 1,100 meters (1,700 to 3,600 feet) in Nevada and 460 to 1,375 meters (1,500 to 4,500 feet) in Arizona. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 230 millimeters (4 to 9 inches); mean annual air temperature is 14 to 21 degrees C. (57 to 69 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 170 to 300 days."
