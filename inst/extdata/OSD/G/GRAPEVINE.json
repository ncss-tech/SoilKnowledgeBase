  "OVERVIEW": "The Grapevine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with some gypsum.  Grapevine soils are on fan piedmonts and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 millimeters (5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (65 degrees F.).",

All these soils lack gypsum influence.  Algerita soils have control sections with 10 to 20 percent carbonate clay.  Cronese soils do not have gypsum in the lower substratum and have 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Guijarral soils are dry from April to January. Kinley and Rillino soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control sections. Nikey soils have a calcic horizon at depths below 50 centimeters (20 inches) and contain more than 20 percent gravel.  Whitlock soils have calcic horizons at depths of 25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches). Wink soils have calcic horizons at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches). Yippin soils have  calcic horizons at 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches)."
