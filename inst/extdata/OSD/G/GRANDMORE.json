  "OVERVIEW": "The Grandmore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
