  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenblair series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphosed basalt.  Glenblair soils are on hills and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 26 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 65 to 95 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 4/2, 4/3 or 2.5YR 3/2.  Moist color is 5YR 3/2, 3/3 or 2.5YR 3/2.  Gravel content is 15 to 25 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 2 to 6 percent, decreasing regularly with increasing depth.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/2;, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay or very gravelly clay with 27 to 45 percent clay.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 50 percent.
