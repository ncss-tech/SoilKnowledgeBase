The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 26 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 65 to 95 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 4/2, 4/3 or 2.5YR 3/2.  Moist color is 5YR 3/2, 3/3 or 2.5YR 3/2.  Gravel content is 15 to 25 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 2 to 6 percent, decreasing regularly with increasing depth.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/2;, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay or very gravelly clay with 27 to 45 percent clay.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 50 percent.

The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."
