    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gyptur soils are on toeslopes of undulating plateaus and on dissected fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from thinly interbedded Cretaceous siltstone and shale.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 percent inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

(A horizon)\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 5 to about 17 inches.  (3Bky horizon)\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at about 46 inches.  (3Cr horizon)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  SAR values are bracketed around one pedon for which data is available.  Salinity values were determined on five pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge or an Instant EC kit.  Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
