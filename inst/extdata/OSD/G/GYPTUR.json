  "OVERVIEW": "The Gyptur series consists of deep and very deep, well drained saline-sodic soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from siltstone and shale.  Gyptur soils are on toeslopes of undulating plateaus and on dissected fan terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
