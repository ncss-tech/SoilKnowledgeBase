The mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry throughout for 45 to 90 days from July 1 to September 30 in most years. The base saturation is over 60 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3. 6/4, 7/3, or 2.5Y 5/4 ans moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6; 7.5YR 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/4.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 25 percent clay modified by 15 to 50 percent rock fragments.

The soil formed in material weathered from ultramafic bedrock.  Elevations are 5,500 to 7,500 feet.  The climate has warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches with about one half falling as snow.  The mean annual temperature varies from 36 degrees to 44 degrees F.  Mean January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F..  The frost-free season ranges from about 75 to 145 days."
