  "OVERVIEW": "The Gozem series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from ultramafic rocks with a large component of serpentinitic minerals.  Gozem soils are on upper mountain ridges and have slopes of 20 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry throughout for 45 to 90 days from July 1 to September 30 in most years. The base saturation is over 60 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3. 6/4, 7/3, or 2.5Y 5/4 ans moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6; 7.5YR 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/4.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 25 percent clay modified by 15 to 50 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has dry color of 2.5YR 5/4; 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/8, or 4/8 and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6 5/6, and 2.5Y 4/4.  It is loam or sandy clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay modified by 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nA C horizon having less clay and more rock fragments than the Bw horizon is in some pedons."

The soil formed in material weathered from ultramafic bedrock.  Elevations are 5,500 to 7,500 feet.  The climate has warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches with about one half falling as snow.  The mean annual temperature varies from 36 degrees to 44 degrees F.  Mean January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F..  The frost-free season ranges from about 75 to 145 days."
