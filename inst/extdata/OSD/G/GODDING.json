  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  Godding soils are generally noncalcareous throughout but may be slightly calcareous in the C horizon in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent, dominantly stones and cobble, with 0 to 15 percent boulders.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section.  The moisture control section is dry from June 1 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is moist in some part for 45 cumulative days from August 15 through October 15.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5YR  through 10YR with value 3 or 4, and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is clay loam or stony loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt and C horizons have hue of 5YR  through 10YR with value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Textures are clay, clay loam, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam with clay ranging up to 55 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dalcan (UT), Des Moines (NM), Golime (CO), and Gordonpoint (UT) series.  Dalcan soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Des Moines soils are slightly warmer with a frost-free period of 90 to 140 days and have moisture control sections that are usually moist from June 1 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Golime soils have Bk horizons.  Gordonpoint soils have rock fragments in the particle-size control section that are mostly gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Godding soils are on mesas, structural benches, ridges, and fan terraces, and on sideslopes of mountains, valleys, mesas, and structural benches.  Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, residuum, and till from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, and breccia over interbedded sandstone and shale or shale.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 9,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches received mostly as late summer rains and winter snow.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 70 to 90 days.  In Arizona, frost-free period may be up to 120 days."
