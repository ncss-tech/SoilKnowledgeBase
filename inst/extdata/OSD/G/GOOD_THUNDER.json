The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 22 inches thick and may include the upper part of the B horizon. The sand content is less than 15 percent in the series control section.  Rock fragments are typically not present in the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2.   It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.   Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and a chroma of 2 to 4.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages between 35 and 50 percent clay.  B/A clay ratios range from 1.2 to 1.4. It is silty clay or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It silt loam or silty clay loam.   Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The horizon typically has fine varves of very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sandy loam 1 to 2 mm thick. The CaCO3 content is typically 10 to 20 percent."

The Arisburg, Arispe, Grundy, Mahaska, Seymour and Tina soils do not have free carbonates above a depth of 50 inches.  Chase soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 36 inches in thickness.  The Greenton, Martin and Rutland soils have clay or silty clay textures in the C horizon.  The Lagonda soils have a lithologic discontinuity of loess over till derived sediment in the control section.  Wymore soils formed in deep loess and typically have less than 10 percent CaCO3 equivalent in the lower third of the series control section.\nAdair, Lagonda, Lamoni and Shorewood soils have a 2C horizon or C horizon of glacial till with rock fragments.  Arisburg, Arispe, Grundy, Mahaska, Seymour and Tina soils do not have free carbonates in the lower third of the series control section.  Chase soils have mollic epipedons that are over 36 inches thick. Greenton soils formed in loess with underlying material of residuum from shale and thinly bedded limestone. Martin soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 24 inches thick. Mayberry soils have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR in the upper Bt horizon. Rutland soils have a lithologic discontinuity at the contact of the loess and clayey glacial till or lacustrine sediments. Wymore soils have an argillic horizon that starts at depths of less than 15 inches."
