  "OVERVIEW": "The Good Thunder series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments. These soils are on glacial lake plains.  Permeability is moderately slow or slow in the upper part, and moderately slow or moderate in the lower part.   Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 22 inches thick and may include the upper part of the B horizon. The sand content is less than 15 percent in the series control section.  Rock fragments are typically not present in the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2.   It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.   Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and a chroma of 2 to 4.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages between 35 and 50 percent clay.  B/A clay ratios range from 1.2 to 1.4. It is silty clay or silty clay loam.
