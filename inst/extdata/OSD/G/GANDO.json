  "OVERVIEW": "The Gando series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, argillite, shale, quartzite, rhyolite or tuffaceous sandstone.  Gando soils are on mountain crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
