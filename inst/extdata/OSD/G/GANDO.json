These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, shale, quartzite, rhyolite, argillite, or tuffaceous sandstone.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,895 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."

Hackwood soils are fine-loamy, are very deep to bedrock, and have a mollic epipedon that is 75 to 90 cm thick.  Hapgood soils are deep and have a mollic epipedon that is 50 to 90 cm thick.  Inpendence soils are very deep and have an umbric epipedon that is 43 to 90 cm thick.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to bedrock, have an argillic horizon, and have a mollic epipedon that is 25 to 38 cm thick.  Tusel soils are deep, have an argillic horizon, and a mollic epipedon that is 41 to 50 cm thick."
