  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 80 inches. Surface horizons having moist color values of less than 3.5 and evident structure, range in thickness from 24 to about 60 inches. Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section ranges from 20 and 35 percent, and more than 15 percent is coarser than very fine sand. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. The soil is noncalcareous above 50 inches.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the A1 horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, with minor areas of fine sandy loam. The A2, horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with in the Bk or Bw horizons.\nThe Bw or Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Thin strata of fine sandy loam, silt loam, and clay are common. Some pedons have buried A horizons that are very dark grayish brown or dark brown."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bippus (TX), Bosque (TX), Gageby (TX), Kaski (KS), and Whitesboro (TX) series. Similar soils are the Bergstrom, Deleon, Frio, Port, and Sinton series. Bippus soils are calcareous above 50 inches and receive less precipitation. Bosque and Gageby soils are calcareous throughout in the majority of pedons. Kaski soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 64 degrees F. Whitesboro soils are moderately well drained and contain redoximorphic features associated with wetness within 40 inches of the surface. Bergstrom and Port soils have fine-silty control sections. Deleon and Frio\nhave fine textured control sections, and the Frio soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Sinton soils are in the hyperthermic family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in loamy alluvium derived dominantly from noncalcareous soils. Flooding occurs at intervals ranging from one or more times a year to once in about every five years unless protected.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches. Frost free days range from 230 to 270 days and elevation ranges from 200 to 950 feet. The Thornthwaite indices range from 30 to about 60."
