  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerrard series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in thin noncalcareous moderately fine textured alluvium overlying sand and gravel substratums.  Gerrard soils are on stream terraces, flood plains and alluvial fans with slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
