These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash and minor amounts of limestone. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,690 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season ranges from about 110 to 150 days."
