  "OVERVIEW": "The Granby series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash or sandy glaciolacustrine deposits on outwash plains, lake plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Kentland soils have an organic layer in the middle part of the series control section. Loup soils are in drier climates that receive less than 720 mm of annual precipitation. Maumee soils have a mollic epipedon that is more than 38 cm thick."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Gumz soils are on similar landforms. The somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are associated with Granby soils at the northern extent of its range and are on swells. The somewhat poorly drained Morocco, Tedrow and Watseka soils are on higher positions on the landscape."

The till substrata is dense, has 27 to 42 percent clay, and occurs at depths of 152 to 200 cm.\nDrained and undrained phases are recognized in Indiana to differentiate between those mapunits that have been artificially drained in order to facilitate crop production and those with natural hydrology.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Records: MI0029 -MAAT<50; MI0395 - MAAT>50; MI0524 - MAAT>50, MUCKY SURFACE; MI0529 - MAAT<50, MUCKY SURFACE; MI0118 - HIGH PPT; MI0672 - LOW PPT; MI0623 - CLAYEY SUBSTRATUM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
