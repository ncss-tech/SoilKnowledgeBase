  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates range from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). These soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section. The  25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) control section averages between 8 and 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent of fine sand coarser particles. These soils commonly have evidence of stratification and the contents of the various sizes of particles change erratically with depth. The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. It typically is loam or silt loam, but it has subhorizons in some pedons that are very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC or C horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It has Fe depletions in some part. It is very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand, but it has strata of silt loam of coarser textures in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA 2C horizon of glacial till is at depths as shallow as 50 inches in some pedons."

They formed in stratified, calcareous lacustrine sediments of the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 610 to 762 mm (24 to 30 inches). Frost free days range form 155 to 200 days.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (13 inches) (Ap and AB and horizons), cambic horizon - the zone from 33 to 91 centimeters (13 to 36 inches) (Bw1, Bw2 and BC horizons).\nGrogan was mapped on slopes over 6 percent in the past as a minor unit. These areas will need to be looked at on an update. They are likely well drained.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 974 for results of some laboratory analysis of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
