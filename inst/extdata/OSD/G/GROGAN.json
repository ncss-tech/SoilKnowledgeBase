  "OVERVIEW": "The Grogan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified, calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains, glacial deltas, and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean  annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 inches),",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates range from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). These soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section. The  25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) control section averages between 8 and 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent of fine sand coarser particles. These soils commonly have evidence of stratification and the contents of the various sizes of particles change erratically with depth. The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. It typically is loam or silt loam, but it has subhorizons in some pedons that are very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC or C horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It has Fe depletions in some part. It is very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand, but it has strata of silt loam of coarser textures in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA 2C horizon of glacial till is at depths as shallow as 50 inches in some pedons."

These areas will need to be looked at on an update. They are likely well drained."
