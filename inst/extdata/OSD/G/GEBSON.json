  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 6 to 11 inches. (Bt horizon)\nMollic epipedon: from 0 to 11 inches. (A, Bt horizons)\nArgillic horizon: from 6 to 11 inches. (Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon: from 11 to 29 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nSecondary carbonates: from 11 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)\nCryic temperature regime.\nThe classification when established was fine-loamy, mixed Argic Cryoborolls. Years later it was discovered that the typical pedon did not have an epipedon thick enough for a mollic epipedon, and the classification was changed to Ustollic Haplocryalfs. During the correlation of the Teller-Park Area in 2010, the type location was moved to a pedon that better represented the original concept of this series, and the classification changed to Calcic Argicryolls.\nThe concept of this series is restricted to grassland plant communities that do not have a significant big sagebrush component. The Gebson series is in areas that do not receive large amounts of winter precipitation and are strongly affected by monsoon rains falling in late July and August; these areas typically do not support big sagebrush. The soil correlated to Gebson in northwest Colorado is no longer considered within the series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
