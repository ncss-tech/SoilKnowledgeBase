They formed in recent gravelly and cobbly alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 15 to 20 degrees C (59 to 68 degrees F).  The frost free period is about 240 to 280 days."
