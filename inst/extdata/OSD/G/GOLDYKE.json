  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldyke series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Goldyke soils are on hills and pediments. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
