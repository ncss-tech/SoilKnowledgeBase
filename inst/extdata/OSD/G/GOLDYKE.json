Celeton soils have soft fragments of diatomaceous earth and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Oceanet soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Perlor soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C., have up to 20 percent platy paragravel, and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Roic soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section, have up to 50 percent paragravel within the control section, and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Slatery soils have 15 to 20 percent pararock fragments in the control section and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Somorent soils are deeper than 25 cm and lack hard bedrock within 100 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,300 to 1,890 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
