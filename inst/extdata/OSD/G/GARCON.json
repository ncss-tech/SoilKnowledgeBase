  "OVERVIEW": "The Garcon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on terraces and in the broad flats of the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is a about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
