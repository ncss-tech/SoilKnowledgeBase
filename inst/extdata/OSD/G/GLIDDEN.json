  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to stratified sandy outwash ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 35 inches. The sandy outwash has more than 85 percent sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silt mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy subsoil.  Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average, but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 throughout the pedon. Stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the A or Ap horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 4 to 6, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 4. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nGlidden soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons, singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizons has colors and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with colors and texture like the Bt part described above.  Glidden soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.\nWhen present, the 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. The 2Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.  The combined thickness of the 2E/B, 2B/E, and 2Bt horizons is 5 inches or more and these horizons have more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nSome pedons have a 3BC horizon (or 3Bt horizon when present) with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, or very gravelly analogs."

The moderately well drained Spiderlake soils, the somewhat poorly drained Whisklake soils, and the poorly drained Annriver soils form a drainage sequence with the Glidden soils. The moderately well drained Beaverbay and Stanberry soils are nearby where the parent material is till.  The moderately well drained Padwood soils and the somewhat poorly drained Worwood soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the substratum is stratified sandy and loamy deposits at depths of 40 to 60 inches. The well drained Padus soils and moderately well drained Tipler soils are on similar landscapes where the silty mantle is thinner or absent."
