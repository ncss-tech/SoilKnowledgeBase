  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gladden series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils are on flood plains along tributary streams in narrow upland valleys.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

Chert gravel in the A horizon and B horizon ranges from 0 to 35 percent and in the C horizon from 25 to 90 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and value of 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons are the gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of loamy sand or sand when the Bw horizon has greater than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam to extremely gravelly sand."
