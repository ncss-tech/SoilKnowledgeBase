Bluemont, Ott, and Whalan soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Kendallville, and Theresa soils have carbonates within 102 cm (40 inches). Douds soils have redox features within the series control section. Kliever, Letort and Lindley soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F). Mandeville soils have and Norden soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Pecatonica and Westville soils have hue of 5YR as coatings or in the matrix in some part of the argillic horizon. Plumcreek soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Renova soils have more than 50 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section and less than 50 percent silt in the middle and lower parts. Rockbridge soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the Bt horizon and throughout the 2Bt horizon. Wykoff soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to the base of soil development and are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grellton soils are on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy  outwash or eolian deposits; in the underlying silty deposits; and,  in many places, in till. The origin of the silty deposits is thought to be eolian (loess). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

Kidder and McHenry soils occupy slightly higher positions on landscapes consisting of glacial till with a thin mantle of loess.
