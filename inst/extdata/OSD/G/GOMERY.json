The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand and range from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma 2 or 3.\nThe E horizons have hue 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Btg or Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 with few to many yellowish brown, dark brown, yellowish red, and red mottles. Some pedons have a mottled matrix, and some pedons have chroma of 3 with mottles in the lower part of the argillic horizon. They are sandy clay loam or clay loam, and range to sandy clay in the lower part of some pedons. The Bt horizons range from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Cr layer ranges from stratified shaly clay and sandstone to weakly or strongly cemented sandstone."
