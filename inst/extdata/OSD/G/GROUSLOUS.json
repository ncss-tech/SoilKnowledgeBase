  "OVERVIEW": "The Grouslous series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Grouslous soils are on steep side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 45 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 10 to 20 inches. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very stony loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 45 to 70 percent gravel."

Bugley, Rohan, and Sylvatus soils have channery textures in the particle-size control section and MAST of more than 54 degrees F.  Dimal soils have channery or flaggy textures in the particle-size control section and are strongly to moderately acid throughout.  Zango soils have 30 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles in the Bw horizon and are derived from tuff, breccia, and andesite."

In addition, Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils are clayey and have a paralithic contact.  Bravo and Cassiday soils occur on side slopes of mountains and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Fritsland soils occur on side slopes of mountains, are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are fine-loamy."
