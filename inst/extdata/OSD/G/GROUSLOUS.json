The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 45 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 10 to 20 inches. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very stony loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

Arnot, Klinesville Nassau, Unicoi, and Weikert soils have less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Bugley, Rohan, and Sylvatus soils have channery textures in the particle-size control section and MAST of more than 54 degrees F.  Dimal soils have channery or flaggy textures in the particle-size control section and are strongly to moderately acid throughout.  Zango soils have 30 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles in the Bw horizon and are derived from tuff, breccia, and andesite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grouslous soils are on steep, active side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevation is 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."

Averlande, Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils occur on broad ridgetops or stable benches of mountains and have argillic horizons.  In addition, Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils are clayey and have a paralithic contact.  Bravo and Cassiday soils occur on side slopes of mountains and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Fritsland soils occur on side slopes of mountains, are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are fine-loamy."
