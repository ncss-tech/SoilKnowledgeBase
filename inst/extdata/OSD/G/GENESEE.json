    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Genesee soils are on flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in alluvium washed mainly from areas of calcareous loamy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 14 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F)."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. These soils are subject to flooding at periodic intervals unless protected by a levee."
