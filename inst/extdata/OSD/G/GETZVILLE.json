  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the underlying sandy material ranges from 15 to 36 inches. The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum. Rock fragments in the substratum range from 0 to 40 percent with up to 5 percent being greater than 3 inches in diameter. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the Ap, moderately acid to neutral in the B horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the 2C.\nThe Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. They have weak or moderate fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure and friable to firm consistence.\nThe Bg1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 or less. Redoximorphic features with chroma of more than 2 make up more than 40 percent of the matrix in the lower part of the B horizon above depths of 30 inches. The Bg horizon is silt loam to silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic parting to moderate or strong medium or coarse subangular blocky or blocky. Consistence is friable to very firm.\nThe Bg2 horizon has color and mottles similar to the Bg1 horizon, but the structure grade is generally weaker. It is silt loam to light silty clay loam. It has friable or very friable consistence except in the 2B3 horizon, which is loose. The B3 horizon contains free carbonates.\nA thin 2Bg2 horizon with loamy fine sand to clay loam textures or their gravelly analogues replaces the Bg2 horizon in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is sand to loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction which, in some pedons, is inter stratified with thin silt loam or very fine sandy loam layers. In most pedons the 2C horizon contains free carbonates."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Getzville is the only known series in this family.\nCanandaigua, Granby, Lamson, Raynham, and Swormville soils are similar series in related families. Canandaigua and Raynham soils have fine-silty and coarse-silty particles size control sections respectively. Granby soils have a sandy particle-size control section and Lamson soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Swormville soils have argillic horizons, are somewhat poorly drained and have chroma of more than 2 in the matrix of the upper part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Getzville are nearly level soils mainly on glacial lake plains, but are also on older alluvial plains. Commonly, this soils is only slightly lower in elevation than the associated somewhat poorly drained soils. Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 56 degrees F., mean annual precipitation from 30 to 45 inches, and mean annual growing season from 120 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Canandaigua, Lamson, Raynham, and Swormville soils and Minoa, Niagara, and Wayland soils. The Minoa soils are moderately well drained, are coarse-loamy and are on slightly higher landforms. Niagara soils are somewhat poorly drained and are silty to depths greater than 40 inches and are on slightly higher landforms. The Wayland soils are poorly drained to very poorly drained fine-silty soils formed in recent alluvium."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low to high. Permeability is moderate to moderately slow in the solum and moderately rapid in the substratum. An apparent seasonal high water table is within 6 inches of the surface from November to June. The lowest areas are subject to rare flooding or ponding during periods of maximum snowmelt or rainfall."
