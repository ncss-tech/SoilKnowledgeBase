These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section.  Depth to dense till (densic material) is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 35 to 50 inches and a weighted average of 35 to 70 percent rounded rock fragments.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.  It has 2 to 4 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly medial fine sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial fine sandy loam,  very gravelly medial sandy loam, or very gravelly medial loam.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 5 to 20 percent field estimated clay and 40 to 60 percent sand.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loamy sand.  It lacks andic soil properties and has a moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.30 g/cc.\nThe Cd horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loamy sand.  It lacks andic soil properties and has a moist bulk density of 1.50 to 2.00 g/cc."
