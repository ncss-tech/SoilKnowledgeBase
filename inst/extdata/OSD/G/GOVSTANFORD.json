    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 20 to 36 inches, (51 to 91 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F, (17 to 19 degrees C).  The soil moisture control section is dry from June to October (120 to 150 days).  The particle-size control section averages 4 to 17 percent clay in the coarse-loamy material and 40 to 60 percent in the clayey material.  Mineralogy is mixed in the coarse-loamy material and smectitic in the clayey material.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent to a depth of 11 inches, (28 cm).  Intersecting slickensides range from common to many in the 2Assg and 2Bssg horizons from 34 to 72 inches, (86 to 183 cm).  A fluctuating water table can occur at depths of 20 to 72 inches, (51 to 183 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through April.  In some pedons oxidized iron masses, iron-manganese concretions and manganese masses occur in the underlying basin material.\nThe Ap horizon dry color is 10YR 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe upper C horizon dry color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Clay content ranges from 3 to 18 percent.

Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silt.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron masses (7.5YR 3/4, 4/4 and 4/6) moist, and iron depletions (10YR 4/2) moist, occur in pores and on ped faces in this part of the horizon.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Assg horizon dry color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1 or 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1 or 3/2.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bssg horizon dry color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 4/1, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1 or 4/2.  Texture is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in hydraulic mine sediment (slickens) over basin alluvium.  Elevation is 110 to 160 feet, (34 to 49 m).  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 23 inches, (508 to 584 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost free season is 245 to 250 days."
