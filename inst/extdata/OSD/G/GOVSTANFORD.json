  "OVERVIEW": "The Govstanford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in hydraulic mine sediment over basin clays.  Govstanford soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans over flood basins.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, (559 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
