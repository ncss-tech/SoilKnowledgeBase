  "OVERVIEW": "The Gochea series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived from weathered tuffs, basalt, rhyolite, andesite, and conglomerate with a component of loess.  The Gochea soils are on fan piedmont remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
