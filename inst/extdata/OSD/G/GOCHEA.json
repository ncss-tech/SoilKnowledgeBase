    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gochea soils are on fan piedmont remnants, stream terraces, and mountain valley fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived from weathered tuffs, basalts, rhyolite, andesite and conglomerate with some influence from loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,555 to 2,170 meters. The climate is cool and semiarid with moist winters and dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, average annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days."
