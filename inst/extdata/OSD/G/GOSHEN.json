  "OVERVIEW": "The Goshen series includes very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived mainly from loess.  These soils are in swales and narrow drainageways of uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 41 centimeters (16 inches) at the type location.",
