  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and are dry in the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Rock fragments in the solum range from 0 to 10 percent. Solum thickness is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The volcanic ash influence is 18 to 30 inches with a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, 15 bar water retention of 12 to 20 percent for air dried samples.  The A and 2BAt horizons contain 2 to 25 percent shot-like aggregates.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The soils are moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A and 2BAt horizon and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have a tuff substratum at 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.\nThe 2BAt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, and value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Field texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Estimated clay based on 2.5 times 15 bar water is 35 to 50 percent throughout the argillic horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the similar Aiken, Raught, and Sites series.  Raught soils are 5 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.  Aiken and Sites soils have a xeric moisture regime and are not dominated by amorphous material in the upper part of the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Germany soils are on foothills, plateaus, ridgetops, and mountains at elevations of 200 to l,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in loessial material underlain by residual soil material from basic igneous rocks. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summer and cool, wet winters. The average January temperature is 38 degrees F and the average July temperature is 64 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 200 to 240 days.  The frost-free period is 150 to 200 days.  The average annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches."

Olequa and Olympic soils have a xeric moisture regime and lack an andic surface layer.  Stimson soils have an aquic moisture regime and are in a fine-silty family."
