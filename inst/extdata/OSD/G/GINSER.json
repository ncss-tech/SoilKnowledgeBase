    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 3 month period following the summer solstice. They are moist in some part for one-half to three-fourths the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. It is 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. It is moderately acid to neutral.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The content of angular rock fragments of pebbles, cobbles, and stones in the solum ranges from 5 to 30 percent pebbles and up to 10 percent cobbles and stones in the A horizons and 40 to 60 percent pebbles and 10 to 20 percent cobbles in the AB and Bt horizons with a weighted average of greater than 35 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and moist with a chroma of 3 to at least 20 inches.\nThe AB and Bt horizons are silty clay loam or silt loam and clay content is 25 to 35 percent. It has weak to moderate subangular blocky structure."

These soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured silty loess deposits over fractured lavas or fine textured sediments. The climate is a semiarid type with cool dry summers and cold winters; the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.; the mean summer temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.; and the mean winter temperature is 28 to 32 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 to 16 inches. The frost free period is 30 to 60 days."
