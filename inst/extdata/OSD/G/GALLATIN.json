  "OVERVIEW": "The Gallatin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on valley bottoms and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
