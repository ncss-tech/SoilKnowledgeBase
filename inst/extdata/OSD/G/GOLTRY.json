  "OVERVIEW": "The Goltry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian and alluvial sediments of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on high terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in).",
