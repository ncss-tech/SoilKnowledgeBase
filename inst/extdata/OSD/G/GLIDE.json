    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 50 to 80 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches during the 4 month period following summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F. Ash deposits overlie a variety of rocks and mixed kinds of alluvium to a depth of greater than 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The moist bulk density is 0.70 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter in the solum and range to 1.0 in the substratum.  Phosphate retention is 25 to 40 percent throughout the solum.  Glass content is 20 to 40 percent.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron is 0.4 to 1.5 percent.  The 15-bar water retention is 5 to 15 percent on dry samples and 15 to 30 percent on undried samples.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 0 to 25 percent fine and medium pumiceous gravel.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loamy sand and has 15 to 25 percent fine and medium pumiceous gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand and has 15 to 35 percent pumiceous gravel.  It is slightly acid to neutral."

Parkdale soils have an umbric epipedon, a phosphate retention of 85 percent or more, field textures of silt loam or loam, and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 3 percent.  Chemawa soils have an umbric epipedon, a phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, and apparent field textures of loam or silt loam.  Trouter soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Shasta soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to sand and gravel.  Walvan soils are silt loam throughout, have a phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent and lack gravel size fragments."
