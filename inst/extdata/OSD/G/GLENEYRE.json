  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 3 to 12 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 70 inches, and depth to contrasting material is 20 to 34 inches. Rock fragments are absent in the solum, but range from 0 to 60 percent in the lower substratum. The rock fragments consist of well rounded and subrounded sandstone gravels and cobbles. Gravels make-up around 65 percent of the total rock fragment fraction. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 0 to 4. It is silt loam, or silt.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or 5GY, value of 4 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2. It is mostly silt, but can be commonly stratified or varved with varying textures and colors. Discontinuous 1 or 2 inch buried organic layers between 26 to 42 inches are common and thought to be of the Pleistocene age. The organic matter can color the surrounding strata with hues as red as 2.5YR.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loamy sand or sand and commonly stratified with different sized gravel and cobble layers."
