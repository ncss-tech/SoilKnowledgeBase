    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Glawe soils are in depressions and drainageways on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in stratified medium textured water-laid deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 762 mm (27 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Grace and the somewhat poorly drained Moltke soils are in the same drainage sequence. The Burleigh soils are coarser textured and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Ingalls and the well drained and moderately well drained Ocqueoc soils are coarser textured and are on higher landscape positions."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate."
