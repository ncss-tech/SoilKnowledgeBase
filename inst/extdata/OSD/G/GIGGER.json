Reaction of the A and Bt horizons ranges from medium acid to extremely acid, except for surface layers that have been limed.  The Btx, 2Btx, and 2Bt horizons range from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The sand content ranges from 5 to 15 percent, dominated by very fine sand.\nThe Btx and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Concretions range from none to common.  Texture of the Btx horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Texture of the 2Btx horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, with 15 to 40 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Byram, Dulac, Loring, and Providence series in the same family and the Byler, Calloway, Grenada, Libuse, and Necessity series.  Byler and Byram soils are underlain by alkaline clays.   Calloway, Grenada, and Loring soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the solum.  Dulac soils have clay or silty clay 2B horizons.   Libuse soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Necessity soils have 1 or 2 chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Providence soils are underlain by siliceous 2B horizons that developed in coastal plain sediment."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gigger soils are on nearly level to sloping terraces.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in a thin mantle of loess over loamy Late Pleistocene Age stream terrace sediments.  The climate is warm and humid. Average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F."
