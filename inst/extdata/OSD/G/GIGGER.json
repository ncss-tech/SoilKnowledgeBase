  "REVDATE": "04/2003",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gigger series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils with fragipans that formed in a thin mantle of loess over loamy sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping stream terraces of late Pleistocene age.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",

Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The sand content ranges from 5 to 15 percent, dominated by very fine sand.\nThe Btx and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Concretions range from none to common.  Texture of the Btx horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.

Byler and Byram soils are underlain by alkaline clays.   Calloway, Grenada, and Loring soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the solum.  Dulac soils have clay or silty clay 2B horizons.   Libuse soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Necessity soils have 1 or 2 chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Providence soils are underlain by siliceous 2B horizons that developed in coastal plain sediment."
