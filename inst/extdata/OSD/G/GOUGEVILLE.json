  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "TDT-SWA",
  "REVDATE": "06/2006",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gougeville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. They formed in nearly level sandy deposits on lake plains, outwash plains and along delta perimeters. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the mineral surface and high or very high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 33 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 25 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent, but may range up to 2 percent by volume in the substratum. Redoximorphic features consisting of Fe/Mn concentrations or clay depletions occur above 20 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam with or without mucky analogues. Some pedons in uncultivated areas have an A horizon with value or chroma one unit lower than an Ap horizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon with hue of 10YR through 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Structure is weak subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture above a depth of 40 inches is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Below 40 inches, some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, and silt loam. The Cg horizon is generally single grain or massive. Consistence is friable, very friable or loose. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Kingsbury, Massena, Pipestone, Rhinebeck and Shaker soils are also associates. Kingsbury and Rhinebeck soils have clayey sola and substrata. Massena soils are formed in loamy till. Pipestone soils have spodic horizons. Shaker soils have a loamy mantle over a clay substrata."
