  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 25 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent, but may range up to 2 percent by volume in the substratum. Redoximorphic features consisting of Fe/Mn concentrations or clay depletions occur above 20 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam with or without mucky analogues. Some pedons in uncultivated areas have an A horizon with value or chroma one unit lower than an Ap horizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon with hue of 10YR through 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Structure is weak subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture above a depth of 40 inches is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Below 40 inches, some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, and silt loam. The Cg horizon is generally single grain or massive. Consistence is friable, very friable or loose. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gougeville soils are nearly level or level soils on lake plains, outwash plains and perimeters of deltaic deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent, but dominantly is 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 36 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F. Mean frost-free season ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 95 to 500 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the excessively drained Plainfield, the moderately well drained Deerfield, and the somewhat poorly drained Junius soils in a drainage sequence. Kingsbury, Massena, Pipestone, Rhinebeck and Shaker soils are also associates. Kingsbury and Rhinebeck soils have clayey sola and substrata. Massena soils are formed in loamy till. Pipestone soils have spodic horizons. Shaker soils have a loamy mantle over a clay substrata."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Runoff potential is negligible or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the mineral surface and high or very high in the substratum. An apparent high water table ranges from the surface to 12 inches deep from November through June. Some pedons pond water for very brief periods."
