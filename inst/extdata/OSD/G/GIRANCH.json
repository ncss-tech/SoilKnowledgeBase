  "OVERVIEW": "The Giranch series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Giranch soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
