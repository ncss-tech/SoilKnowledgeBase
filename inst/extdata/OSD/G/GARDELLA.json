  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gardella soils are on lake terraces adjacent to volcanic cones.  They formed in alluvium derived from basaltic tuff over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,219 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hooten, Huxley, Isolde, Labou, and Parran soils. Hooten soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow to thin duripans, and occur on adjacent lake terraces and beach terraces. Huxley soils are clayey-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, very deep, and have natric horizons. Isolde soils are sandy, very deep, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on dunes. Labou soils are loamy-skeletal, are very shallow and shallow to lithoid tufa, and have natric horizons. Parran soils are fine, very deep, and have salic horizons."

High areas have a deep water table, whereas the low terraces have a water table at depths of 150 to 200 cm."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 cm (Az horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 25 to 61 cm (Bqm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (Az and Bq horizons.)\nFuture investigation is needed of this soil to confirm whether the restrictive feature is a duripan or simply a bedrock layer derived from a consolidated volcanic deposit such as basaltic tuff.  A cursory examination of the layer from one site indicated that the material was geologic and not pedogenic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
