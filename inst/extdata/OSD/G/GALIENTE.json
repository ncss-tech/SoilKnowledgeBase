These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Clay content in the particle-size control section averages from 35 to 55 percent and has a 20 percent absolute increase within a vertical distance of 3 inches. Depth to abrupt textural change is 10 to 20 inches.  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry,  2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It has 15 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It has 15 to 25 percent clay.   Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist. Texture is clay or clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Galiente soils are on structural benches and hillsides at elevations of 600 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium with a mantle of loess. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."
