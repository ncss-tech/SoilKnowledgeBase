  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to lamellae ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Depth to the base of the lamellae ranges from 29 to more than 80 inches. Fine sand is less than 40 percent throughout. Combined thickness of the lamellae is less than 6 inches within a depth of 80 inches. Typically these soils contain no rock fragments. Volume of gravel averages less than 10 percent in the series control section. Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more. Redoximorphic accumulations are in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum typically below 40 inches and redoximorphic depletions also occur there in some pedons. Saturation occurs at 40 to 60 inches for some time in normal years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of Ap or A horizon is loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nGrettum soils have an E & Bt horizon (lamellae). The E part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is typically sand but in some pedons it is loamy sand. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is typically sand or loamy sand, but in some pedons it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. The Bt part has a combined thickness of less than 6 inches. Some pedons have thin clay lenses.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sand.\nThe C horizon has color and texture like the BC horizon above."

Grettum soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits which have lamellae, or both. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from about 110 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1300 feet."
