The clay content in the control section averages 18 to 27 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or silt loam with thin layers of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in some pedons. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam and is stratified with fine sandy loam and sandy loam in some pedons.  It has up to 5 percent by volume pebbles.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.

Flandreau soils grade to sandy material within a depth of 40 inches.  Germantown soils have quartzite bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Ves soils contain 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments which are dominantly shale, typically have free carbonates at depths of less than 30 inches and formed in glacial till.  Clarno and Hand soils have carbonates within a depth of 26 inches and formed in glacial sediments.  Henkin soils are in a coarse-loamy family."

Kranzburg and Moody soils are on slightly lower landscapes.  Kranzburg and Moody soils are in the fine-silty family.
