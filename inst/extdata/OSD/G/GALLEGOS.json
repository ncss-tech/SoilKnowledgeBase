    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These potentially are the Polar, and Powerline series, if active cation exchange activity class is assigned.  Similar soils are the Chilicotal, Gallen, Gilland, and Tombstone series.  Polar soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Powerline soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches of the surface.  Chilicotal, Gallen, Gilland, and Tombstone soils are in the superactive cation exchange activity class family.  In addition, Chilicotal soils contain igneous pebbles, Gallen soils have discontinuities that are sandy, Gilland soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 30 inches of the surface, and Tombstone soils do not have lithologic discontinuities."

The soils formed in calcareous sand, gravel, and cobbles. At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The average annual temperature is 55 to 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 180 days. Elevations ranges from 3,800 to 4,700 feet. Thornthwaite P-E Index is 24."
