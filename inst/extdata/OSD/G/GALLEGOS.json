Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5\nmoist, and chroma 3 to 6. Texture is extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly loam. The gravel content ranges from 50 to 75 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to\n6 moist, and chroma from 2 to 5. The upper part of the C horizon\nranges from light sandy clay loam to clay loam and has 50 to 75\npercent gravel. Calcium carbonate content of the Bk horizon exceeds 15 percent. Some pedons do not have 2BC and 3BCk horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These potentially are the Polar, and Powerline series, if active cation exchange activity class is assigned.  Similar soils are the Chilicotal, Gallen, Gilland, and Tombstone series.  Polar soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Powerline soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches of the surface.  Chilicotal, Gallen, Gilland, and Tombstone soils are in the superactive cation exchange activity class family.  In addition, Chilicotal soils contain igneous pebbles, Gallen soils have discontinuities that are sandy, Gilland soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 30 inches of the surface, and Tombstone soils do not have lithologic discontinuities."

The soils formed in calcareous sand, gravel, and cobbles. At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The average annual temperature is 55 to 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 180 days. Elevations ranges from 3,800 to 4,700 feet. Thornthwaite P-E Index is 24."

Quay soils are calcareous to the surface and contain few pebbles and cobbles. Tucumcari soils have an argillic horizon and do not have a strong zone of calcium carbonate accumulation."
