  "OVERVIEW": "The Gompers series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Gompers soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
