Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the Oi and A horizons, from moderately acid to slightly acid in the Bo1 and Bo2 horizons and from slightly acid to neutral in the BC and C horizons.  The combined total of iron stone fragments in the control section is less than 15 percent, by volume.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is mucky peat or muck in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown and yellow.

The average annual precipitation ranges from 68 to 134 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F."

El Descanso (T) and Hoconuco (T) soils do not have an oxic horizon and are coarser textured.  Cerro Gordo (T) soils are on more stable positions and are very deep.  Aljibe (T) soils are on similar positions but are shallow to serpentinite bedrock. Indiera (T) soils are on similar positions but are deep to serpentinite bedrock."

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nGuama soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
