  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Geisercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on backslopes to toeslopes of mountains. Geisercreek soils are formed in a mantle of volcanic ash overlying material derived from soft tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
