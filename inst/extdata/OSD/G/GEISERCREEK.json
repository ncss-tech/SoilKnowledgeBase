Geisercreek soils are formed in a mantle of volcanic ash overlying material derived from soft tuffs. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

This series concept might also have an ashy over loamy class; however, ashy over clayey is the most contrasting\nThe 2Eb horizon may also be described as a 2Ab, 2Aeb, 2Ebb, 2Bwb, or 2Bw in other areas where this series concept is recognized\nThe dominant USFS plant association is ABGR/LIB02; others may include ABGR/VASC and ABGR/CARU\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
