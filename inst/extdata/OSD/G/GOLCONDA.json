  "OVERVIEW": "The Golconda series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a mantle of loess high in volcanic ash. The Golconda soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
