  "OVERVIEW": "The Goosebury series consists of very deep, well drained soils on  outwash fans and fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium dominantly from  limestone.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid or moderately rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. The average annual  precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is  about 36 degrees F.",
