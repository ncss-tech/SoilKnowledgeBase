  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodview series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess overlying bedrock on mountains.  Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
