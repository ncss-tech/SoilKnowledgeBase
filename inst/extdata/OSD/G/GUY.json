  "OVERVIEW": "The Guy series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from the Ogallala formation.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Guy soils are on gravelly hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

Some horizons have up to 50 percent rock fragments, but the average for the particle-size control section is less than 35 percent.  Less than 40 percent of the rock fragments is larger than gravel.  Annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam or loam with gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly phases.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8 dry and 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam in which strata of loamy sand are common.  The calcic horizon has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
