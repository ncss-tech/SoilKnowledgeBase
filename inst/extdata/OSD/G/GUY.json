Some horizons have up to 50 percent rock fragments, but the average for the particle-size control section is less than 35 percent.  Less than 40 percent of the rock fragments is larger than gravel.  Annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam or loam with gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly phases.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8 dry and 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam in which strata of loamy sand are common.  The calcic horizon has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
