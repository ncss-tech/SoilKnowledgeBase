  "OVERVIEW": "The Garval series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
