The soils formed in silty alluvium that is high in mica over thick deposits of alluvial sand and gravel.  The climate is cold continental.  Mean annual temperatures range from 20 to 28 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches."

Nenana soils have brown sola developed in moderately deep silty deposits over outwash gravel.  Volkmar soils have mottled sola in moderately deep silty deposits over outwash gravel and have moderately deep water tables."
