  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. DBS/SR",
  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodpaster series consists very poorly drained soils formed in micaceous silty loess overlying alluvium on terraces.  Goodpaster soils are perennially frozen.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

Thickness of the silt loam mantle and depth to the sandy-skeletal substratum ranges from 10 to 25 inches.  A black or very dark brown A horizon up to 6 inches thick is present in some pedons.  The water table is usually close to the ground surface but may be as deep as 20 inches in midsummer.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 10 to 25 inches when the organic mat is undistrubed."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goodpaster soils occupy low terraces bordering floodplains of streams carrying glacial outwash water.  The soils formed in silty alluvium that is high in mica over thick deposits of alluvial sand and gravel.  The climate is cold continental.  Mean annual temperatures range from 20 to 28 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Donnelly, Nenana, and Volkmar soils.  Donnelly soils have thin brown silty sola over outwash gravel.  Nenana soils have brown sola developed in moderately deep silty deposits over outwash gravel.  Volkmar soils have mottled sola in moderately deep silty deposits over outwash gravel and have moderately deep water tables."
