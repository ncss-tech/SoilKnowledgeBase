  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grabbler soils are on alluvial fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,524 to 1,829 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Lousight soils have an aridic soil moisture regime, less than 10 percent clay in the particle size control section and have no argillic horizon. Toejom soils have less than 10 percent clay in their particle size control section, an ochric epipedon and paralithic contact at depths of 36 to 50 cm."
