  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Eram series of the same family and the Ashwood, Bonham and Caney series of similar families.  Eram soils are underlain by alkaline shale between depths of 20 to 40 inches and are no redder than 10YR throughout.  Ashwood and Caney soils lack wetness mottles within 16 inches of the surface.  Bonham soils have higher content of clay in the lower Bt horizon, lack 5YR hue in the lower Bt horizon, and have high chroma mottles in the lower Bt horizon."

Caspiana and Gallion soils are in slightly higher positions on the outer edge of stream terraces. Pledger and Roebuck soils are usually in lower positions on the back side of terraces in more frequently flooded positions. Caspiana and Gallion soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Pledger soils lack an argillic horizon and have soft powdery carbonates between depths of 24 to 60 inches. Roebuck soils lack an argillic horizon and have COLE of more than 0.09."
