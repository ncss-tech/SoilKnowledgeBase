The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  However, available data indicate that the clay mineralogy typically is illitic and the particle-size class is fine family.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
