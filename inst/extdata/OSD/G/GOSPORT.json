  "OVERVIEW": "The Gosport series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 0 to 40 centimeters of silty or loamy materials of unknown origin and in the underlying residuum from brown and gray acid Pennsylvania shales with clayey shale at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters. These soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams. Slope ranges from 5 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 millimeters.",

The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  However, available data indicate that the clay mineralogy typically is illitic and the particle-size class is fine family.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006."
