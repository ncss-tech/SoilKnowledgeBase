    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the loamy colluvium and depth to siliceous sandy colluvium or residuum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Rock fragments are both dolomite and sandstone in the colluvium and are just sandstone in the residuum. Volume of channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy colluvium and from 0 to 35 percent in the sandy colluvium and residuum.  Volume of flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the O and A horizons and from moderately acid to neutral throughout the rest of the pedon.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2. The O horizon is a layer of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or the channery analogs or flaggy analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is sand, fine sand or the channery or flaggy analogs.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2C horizon described above."

These soils formed in loamy colluvium and in siliceous sandy colluvium or residuum, or both, from the underlying sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  THE frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1100 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1994, this soil was mapped as steep and very steep miscellaneous areas (i.e. steep stony land, etc.) on valley sides associated with the Jordan sandstone formation in M105. Typically, these soils are on valley sides below summits and shoulders which are, or were,  capped with dolomite bedrock which contributed to the pH and base saturation of the upper parts of the pedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: ochric epipedon - 2 to 11 inches (A, E); argillic horizon - 11 to 32 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); paralithic contact - 56 inches (2Cr).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0580.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
