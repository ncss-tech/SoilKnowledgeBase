  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 65 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly subrounded gravels or channers, range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the solum and from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Some pedons have redoximorphic features below 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or sand and is commonly stratified."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grigsby soils are on low stream terraces, flood plains, natural levees and the tread and riser landforms adjacent to major streams and rivers. Slope gradients are mostly 0 to 4 percent, but range to 20 percent on tread and riser landforms. These soils formed in mixed alluvium washed from mostly Pennsylvanian aged sandstone, shale, siltstone and limestone. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches."

Allegheny, Chavies, Cotaco, Elk, Morehead and Shelocta soils are on higher landforms and have argillic horizons. Nolin soils are fine-silty. Orrville soils are fine-loamy and somewhat poorly drained. Rowdy and Pope soils have lower base saturations. Skidmore soils are loamy-skeletal. Potomac soils are sandy-skeletal. Yeager soils are sandy."
