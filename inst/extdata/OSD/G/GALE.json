Future MLRA correlations may separate these mapunits by geologic formation.\nSmall areas of Gale soils have been mapped in areas beyond the physiographic concept of the Gale series; future MLRA soil survey updates may investigate and re-correlate these areas.\nTaxonomy versionKeys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
