  "OVERVIEW": "The Gale series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone. These soils are on hills of sandstone bedrock controlled uplands.  These soils formed mostly in loess underlain by siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 millimeters.  Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Future MLRA correlations may separate these mapunits by geologic formation.\nSmall areas of Gale soils have been mapped in areas beyond the physiographic concept of the Gale series; future MLRA soil survey updates may investigate and re-correlate these areas.\nTaxonomy versionKeys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
