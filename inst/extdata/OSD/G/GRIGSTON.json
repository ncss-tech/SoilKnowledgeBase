  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 48 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The control section contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  Stratification, evidenced by minor variations in color value and in clay content, is between depths of 15 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silt loam but range includes silty clay loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons contain strata of loam or fine sandy loam.  This horizon mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Horizons containing sand or clay, or both, and faint mottling are below 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bridgeport series in the same family and the Detroit, Hobbs, Hord, Humbarger, McCook, Muir, Roxbury, and Tobin series.  Bridgeport and Roxbury soils contain free carbonates at depths less than l5 inches.  Detroit soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and the argillic horizon contains more than 35 percent clay.  Hobbs soils lack a mollic epipedon and are thinly stratified.  Hord, Humbarger, and Tobin soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  McCook soils are coarse-silty.  Muir soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and more acid upper horizons."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 28 inches.  Thornthwaite annual PE index ranges from 30 to 52."
