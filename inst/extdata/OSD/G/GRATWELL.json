  "OVERVIEW": "The Gratwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and schist. The Gratwell soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1025 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
