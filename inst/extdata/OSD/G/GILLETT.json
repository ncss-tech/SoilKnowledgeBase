  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to weakly consolidated sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Masses of calcium carbonate are between 14 and 27 inches.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 4 dS/m in lower part of the profile.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 40 to 55 percent. Accumulations of iron and manganese are relict redoximorphic features.  Surface fragments up to 24 inches across range from none to about 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The surface is hard or very hard and massive when dry.  Some pedons have up to 5 percent by volume siliceous pebbles and sandstone fragments up to 6 inches across.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.  Few to many masses of iron and manganese accumulations are in shades of red, yellow, brown or gray.  Dark clay films and coats are in most pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Few to common masses of iron and manganese accumulations are in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Few to common films and threads of calcium carbonate may occur.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BCtk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay.  Few to many masses of iron and manganese accumulations are in shades of yellow or brown.  Few masses of calcium carbonate. Some pedons contain pockets or clusters of salt, gypsum or other salts in the lower part.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The material is weakly consolidated sandstone of fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam texture.  Some pedons have thin layers of weakly cemented sandstone and soft siltstone interbedded with the weakly consolidated sandstone.  Some pedons contain B material in small pockets or channels.  Streaks and spots in shades of yellow and brown range from few to common.  Some pedons have a few masses of calcium carbonate. Most of this material slakes in water.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series.  Similar soils include the Bryde, Floresville, Miguel, Papalote, and Wilco series.  All these soils are very deep and do not have sandstone layers within 40 inches of the surface.  Bryde soils have vertic properties and do not have iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or gray in the Bt.  Floresville, Miguel, Papalote and Wilco soils have masses of calcium carbonate deeper than 27 inches.  In addition, Papalote soils have iron depletions due to wetness."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Miguel and Papalote series.\nThe diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches, consisting of the A horizon.\nAbrupt texture change - at 7 inches.\nArgillic horizon - from 7 to 27 inches, consisting of the Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons.\n2Cr feature - Most of this material slakes in water, it can be dug with moderate difficulty with a spade.  This does not meet the requirement of a paralithic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Karnes County, Texas; TAMU Soil Characterization Lab S88TX-255-004\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD NUMBER: TX1187\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
