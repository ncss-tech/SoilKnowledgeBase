  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The chert gravel content of the A and E horizons ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  The 2Bt horizons contain 5 to 30 percent chert gravel and 0 to 25 percent fragments larger than 3 inches.  About 20 percent are less than 1/4 inch in size.  Some pedons are stony on the surface. The particle size control section averages from 60 to 85 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, but may be 2 just above bedrock.  It is clay, silty clay, gravelly clay, flaggy clay, very gravelly clay, or gravelly silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons are very strongly acid in the upper part. Redoximorphic colors are in the lower subsoil.\nThe 2BC or 2C horizon is variable in color.  It is the channery or very channery analogs of clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is slighty acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gatewood soils are on gently sloping ridges and strongly sloping side slopes in uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  They formed in gravelly hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum from cherty limestone or dolomite and shales. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Mano and Ocie soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock. These soils are on lower side slope positions or on the same positions in the landscape as Gatewood."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

In undisturbed areas, a perched water table with an upper limit of 1.5 to 3 feet is present during parts of late winter and early spring in most years."
