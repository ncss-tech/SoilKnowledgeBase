  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gravois soils are on convex ridgetops and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and pedisediment, and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from dolomite. The contact of the contrasting material is marked by a gravelly erosional surface. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches."

Bardley and Gatewood soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches and are on adjacent side slopes.  Clarksville and Goss soils are gravelly throughout and are on narrower ridgetops and adjacent side slopes.  Lebanon soils have a fragipan and are on similar landscapes.  Niangua soils have a gravelly surface layer, bedrock at 40 to 60 inches, and are on adjacent side slopes.  Useful soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and are on similar landforms."
