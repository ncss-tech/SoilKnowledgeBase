  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gravois series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and pedisediment and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from dolomite.  Permeability is moderate in the Bt horizon and slow in the 2Btx horizon.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
