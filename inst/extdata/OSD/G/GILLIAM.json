  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. The average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section is 18 to 35 percent. Thin strata of coarser or finer texture occur in the lower part of some pedons.  Reaction commonly is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but is neutral in the surface layer of some pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon is stratified and has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam, but may be loam. When present, redoximorphic features have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8.\nThe Ab horizon has color and texture similar to the A horizon.  Some pedons do not have this horizon."

Haynie soils are on slightly higher landscapes. Leta, Modale, Waldron, and Waubonsie soils are on similar landscapes. Sarpy soils generally are closer to the streams."
