  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum.  Rock fragments are schist, phyllite and metamorphosed limestone.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly or channery analogs.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon with properties similar to the Ap horizon.\nSome undisturbed pedons have a thin, discontinuous E horizon under the A horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is up to 2 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is up to 5 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a thin discontinuous Cr horizon that has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  It is up to 5 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Glover soils are level to very steep soils on tops and sideslopes of hills, ridges, and mountains.  They formed in till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from interbedded dark mica schist and metamorphosed limestone or phyllite.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches.   Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days.  Elevations range from 500 to 1750 feet above mean sea level."

The well drained Dummerston and Shelburne soils, moderately well drained Buckland and Fullam soils, poorly drained Cabot soils and very poorly drained Peacham soils are all in lower positions on the landscape.  The somewhat excessively drained Pomfret soils and well drained Vershire soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  Pomfret soils are sandy and Vershire soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

The former classification was Loamy, mixed, frigid Lithic Haplumbrepts.\n2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Lithic feature - bedrock at 12 inches from the soil surface. (R horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S74VT-17-16, S84VT-23, S86VT23-2, S86VT23-4 and, S86VT23-6.\nSoil Interpretation Record Numbers for this series are:\nGlover: VT0016 Glover, stony: VT0072\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
