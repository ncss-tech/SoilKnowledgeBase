  "OVERVIEW": "The Gorst series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess over a duripan.  Gorst soils are on uplands, alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 54 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches more than half of the time when the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 9 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser including rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has weak or moderate structure.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is loam or silt loam and can be gravelly.  It has moderate prismatic or blocky structure.  It has 0 to 20 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon is indurated, has a gravelly to extremely gravelly matrix 4 to 36 inches thick with 1 to 5 inch thick plates.  It overlies weakly cemented to indurated alluvial material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blalock, Chainlink (T), Moxee, Urmafot and Vadaho series.  Blalock soils have a very strongly calcareous duripan.  Chainlink and Moxee soils have less than 18 percent clay and more than 10 percent coarse fragments.  Urmafot and Vadaho soils have a calcic horizon within the particle-size control section.  Vadaho soils lack a cambic horizon."

These soils formed in a thin loess mantle over a duripan. The gravel of the 2Bkq horizon is associated with the Ellensburg formation.  The soils are in a semiarid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 135 to 170 days."
