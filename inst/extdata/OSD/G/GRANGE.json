  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 33 inches. Gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and 0 to 45 percent in the underlying, coarser textured material. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the solum and strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.\nUndisturbed pedons have Oa, Oe, or Oi horizons with a combined thickness of up to 5 inches.  They are neutral or have hue of 5YR to 5Y, and value of 2 or 2.5 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Ap or A horizon  has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. It is up to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is typically silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but ranges to fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but ranges to fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a BCg or Cg horizon with colors similar to the 2Cg horizon.  They are up to 5 inches thick.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon with chroma that range from 3 to 6.  Texture ranges from fine sand to coarse sand and their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Some pedons contain strata of finer textures that range from silt loam to loamy fine sand.  It is massive or single grain."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes is dominantly 0 to 3 percent, but range up to 8 percent.  The soil material is derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and phyllite.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches."

Roundabout soils are in similar positions on the landscape and do not have sandy textures within 40 inches of the surface."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. Grange Series were formerly recognized and mapped in New Hampshire as Raynham Variant.  The series includes about 750 acres correlated and published in Carroll County, New Hampshire as Raynham silt loam, sandy subsoil variant.\n2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 27 inches (Bw, Bg1, Bg2 horizons).\nc.  Aquepts feature - horizons at a depth of less than 20 inches (50 cm) from the mineral soil surface that have redox concentrations and matrix chroma of 2 or less (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\nd.  Aeric feature - horizon within a depth of 30 inches (75 cm) from the mineral soil surface that has hue of 10YR or yellower and value and chroma of 3 or more (Bw horizon).\ne.  Nonacid feature - soil reaction is greater than 5.5 in 1:1 water in at least some part between 10 and 40 inches (2Cg1 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
