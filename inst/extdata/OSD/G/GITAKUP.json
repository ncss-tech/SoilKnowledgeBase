  "OVERVIEW": "The Gitakup series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks. Gitakup soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
