  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the landfill materials is generally more than 2 meters. The human transported material may be any geologic deposits ranging from outwash, coastal plain sediments, alluvial sediment, or sediment from coastal waterways. The thickness of the human transported material cap over the upper garbage layer ranges from 18 to 50 centimeters. Rock fragments in the soil cap range from 1 to 30 percent and the texture includes loamy sand or coarser.  Rock fragments average more than 35 percent in the control section and are dominated by artifacts in the underlying landfill material. Reactions in the fill cap range from extremely acid to slightly alkaline. Reaction in the garbage layers is estimated to be neutral to moderately alkaline. Sea shell fragments may be present in some pedons where dredged and coastal material is present.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Typically these horizons are structureless or have weak subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe ^E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically they are single grained or show a weak very fine subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe ^Bw or ^ BC horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 and 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically they are structureless or have very fine subangular blocky structure. Typically iron oxidation mottles are present. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe ^C horizon if present  have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. They are massive or single grained. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe 2^Cu layers of garbage contain human transported soil and rock material as well as household waste, paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, rubber, leather, carpet, clothing, shoes, organic waste, tires, unburned coal, and plastic bags. There is a smaller component of construction materials such as gypsum board, concrete, brick, lumber, steel, and asphalt, plus small amounts of coal ash. Household objects range from gravel to stone sized, and construction materials range from gravel to boulder size. There is a distinction between material that will hold water, allow roots to penetrate, and those that will decompose versus those that are cohesive, impermeable, and persistent (that is, function similar to a rock fragment). Examples of such fragments are glass, plastic, rubber, tires, and construction debris (except lumber). Generally, the human transported fill material is similar to the soil cap over the uppermost garbage layer. Rock fragments (natural and artifacts) range from 35 to nearly 100 percent. Consistence is very friable to firm. Some intermittent layers or materials such as plastic act as a barrier to roots and water movement."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gravesend soils are on nearly level to very steep modified landforms in landfills. These soils formed in a mixture of household and human transported material, with a cap of human transported material that is relatively clean of refuse. The human transported material is dominantly from locally excavated materials such as alluvium, outwash, coastal plain sediments, or dredged sediments from coastal waterways. Dominant coarse fragments are sea shells or human manufactured items with smaller amounts of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, basalt, and quartzite pebbles. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

Greatkills soils are comprised mainly of loamy fill instead of sand. Oldmill soils have garbage contact within 50 to 100 cm."

The potential for surface runoff is very low to low on vegetated slopes less than 20 percent and medium on vegetated slopes 20 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class more rapid where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is protected from erosion. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are generally covered with common reed and mugwort. A few hardwoods such as black locust, tree of heaven (Ailanthus), black cherry, and boxelder become established in areas that do not burn on a frequent basis. Reclamation is unlikely in areas where the soil cap is less than 60 centimeters thick, where soil or garbage occur on surface, or where common reed is unmanaged. Recreational use is also unlikely under these conditions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Gravesend soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nAccording to the New York City Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Hazardous Waste Remediation many landfill areas were unregulated at the time of filling and may contain chemicals that are toxic to plant roots. In addition, most areas develop anaerobic conditions in the subsoil due to methane gas emissions. Some pedons contain pockets where organic garbage has decomposed, and are subject to collapses under heavy equipment or weight.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 centimeters (^Au horizon).\n2. Non-cambic pedogenic horizon - the zone from 5 to 20 cm (^Bw horizon).\n3. Redoximorphic features have inherited their colors by type of deposition and oxidation.\n4. Particle-size control section - artifacts that behave like rock fragments make up more than 65 percent of the total rock fragments in the particle size control section. Artifacts make up about one third of the volume of the soil/garbage mixture.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Complete characterization data collected for soil cap as pedon S97NY081-008. Lab data is not available on the garbage subsoil because of possible hazardous material content.\nOne year soil temperature data is available for 10 cm and 50 cm depths. A poster describing temperature investigations is referenced below. The internal soil temperature has been modified by high levels of biological activity and garbage undergoing rapid decomposition. The classification as hyperthermic is the subject of some debate but the study and lab data support the hyperthermic soil temperature classification. The area would typically be mesic.\nReference: Mount, Henry and Luis Hernandez. Temperature Signatures for Urban Soils of New York City.
