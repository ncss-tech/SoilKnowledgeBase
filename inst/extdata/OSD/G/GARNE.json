  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 15 to 35 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Garne soils typically have a paralithic contact (Cr horizon) of glauconitic sandstone 10 inches or more thick that grades to a lithic contact (R horizon) below 40 inches. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy residuum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe A horizon has color like the Ap horizon. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5G, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the channery analogs. It has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bw horizon above. It is glauconitic sandstone bedrock.\nThe 2R horizon has color like the 2Bw horizon above. It is glauconitic sandstone bedrock. Some pedons do not have a 2R horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Garne soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands. Slope gradients range from 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in reworked (by wind or water, or both) sandy outwash and in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 850 to 950 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Finchford and Urne soils. The somewhat excessivley drained Urne soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Garne soils where the soil is loamy throughout over the glauconitic sandstone. The excessively drained Finchford soils are nearby on outwash terraces where the soil formed entirely in sandy outwash."
