  "OVERVIEW": "The Garne series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with glauconitic sandstone on hills on bedrock controlled uplands. These soils formed in re-worked (by wind or water, or both) sandy outwash and in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 15 to 35 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Garne soils typically have a paralithic contact (Cr horizon) of glauconitic sandstone 10 inches or more thick that grades to a lithic contact (R horizon) below 40 inches. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy residuum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe A horizon has color like the Ap horizon. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5G, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the channery analogs. It has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bw horizon above. It is glauconitic sandstone bedrock.\nThe 2R horizon has color like the 2Bw horizon above. It is glauconitic sandstone bedrock. Some pedons do not have a 2R horizon."
