  "OVERVIEW": "The Garita series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick calcareous very cobbly, moderately fine textured sediments from basalt. Garita soils are on alluvial fans and valley filling side slopes and have slopes from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 65 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 5 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 5 to 40 inches.  The soil above the calcic horizon ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.  The calcic horizon ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay. Total rock fragments in the particle size control section range from 35 to 75 percent.  A few thin subhorizons of some pedons have hue redder than 7.5YR.  The soil moisture regime is Typic Aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe BCk or Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent."

These soils formed in thick, calcareous, very gravelly or very cobbly, moderately fine textured slope alluvium from basalt. The average annual precipitation is 7 inches, but ranges from 6 to 9 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 8,800 feet.  Frost free days are 90 to 115."
