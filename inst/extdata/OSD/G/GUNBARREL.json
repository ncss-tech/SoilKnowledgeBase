  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  The soils range from moderately to very strongly alkaline.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 60 percent with subhorizons totaling more than 4 inches thick and containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium occurring above a depth of 24 inches.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches.  Depth to a continuous horizon of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and are dominantly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  A water table ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 feet during most of the year.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe AC horizon, when present, is intermediate in color to both the A and C horizons.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 1 through 4.  Mottles are distinct to prominent.  Calcium carbonate is less than 5 percent by weight."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gunbarrel soils are on low terraces, flood plains, and low alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in wind reworked alluvium from volcanic rocks containing a high percentage of dark gray and red volcanic mineral grains.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches, with peak periods of moisture in the middle and late summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,800 feet.  The frost-free period ranges from 85 to 100 days."
