  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gunbarrel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed in wind reworked alluvium from volcanic rocks containing dominant amounts of dark gray and red volcanic mixed grains.  Gunbarrel soils are on flood plains, terraces, and low alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  The soils range from moderately to very strongly alkaline.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 60 percent with subhorizons totaling more than 4 inches thick and containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium occurring above a depth of 24 inches.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches.  Depth to a continuous horizon of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and are dominantly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  A water table ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 feet during most of the year.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe AC horizon, when present, is intermediate in color to both the A and C horizons.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 1 through 4.  Mottles are distinct to prominent.  Calcium carbonate is less than 5 percent by weight."
