Appleseed and Redneedle soils are not dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravels. In addition, Appleseed soils have a calcium carbonate equivalence ranging to 35 percent and formed in limestone. Redneedle soils have hue of 5YR and formed in sandstone conglomerate. Hyder and Quilotosa soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July - September. Sunrock soils have control sections dominated by fine and medium sand and formed on volcanic rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldroad soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 490 and up to 3,500 feet on south facing aspects. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. They formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium from granite and metamorphic rocks. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 8 inches; mean annual air temperature is 69 to 78 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 280 to 360 days."
