  "OVERVIEW": "The Grassytrail series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Grassytrail soils are on drainageways near gypsiferous shale hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
