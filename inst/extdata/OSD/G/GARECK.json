    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nMean annual soil temperature: 65 to 68 degrees F.\nDepth to displaced fragments of a natric horizon: 4 to 8 inches.\nElectrical conductivity: 0 to 4 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 0 to 8.\nAp1 Horizon--10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3 dry; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 moist. Many pedons have been greatly darkened by the addition of large amounts of organic matter, but it is believed that they lack enough organic carbon to be mollic epipedons.\nClay: 10 to 20 percent.\nTexture: Commonly a sandy loam, but this can vary greatly due to surface mixing and land leveling.\nCarbonates: Slightly to violently effervescent. (Calcium carbonate equivalent 1 to 3 percent)\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline\nAp2, Ap3 and Ap4 Horizons--10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 dry; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 moist.\nTexture: Loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nClay: 18 to 30 percent.\nClay films: Few to many, thin to moderately thick in pores, bridging sand grains, and on fragments of displaced natric horizon.\nCarbonates: Slightly to violently effervescent.  (Calcium carbonate equivalent 1 to 5 percent.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\n2Bk Horizon--10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4 dry; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 moist.\nTexture: Stratified loamy sand to sandy clay loam.\nClay: averages 8 to 18 percent and ranges 3 to 30 percent.\nCoarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent.\nCarbonates: Strongly to violently effervescent. (Calcium carbonate equivalent 1 to 5 percent)\nCoarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nReaction: Commonly is slightly to moderately alkaline, but ranges to very strongly alkaline in some pedons. This is highly variable due to the degree of reclamation.\nOther features: Crystals of gypsum occur in some pedons in the Ap or 2Bk horizons where gypsum has been added to the soil."

The soils formed in the chemically and mechanically reclaimed remnants of the Garces series (Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Natrargids).  Garces soils formed in granitic alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 210 to 390 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches, the mean annual temperature is 63 to 66 degrees F., and the frost free season is 250 to 275 days.  Flooding is rare."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was derived from a fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Natrargids (Garces Series) but has been mechanically ripped to a depth of 47 inches or more in the typical pedon, and has been treated with farm chemicals (gypsum, sulfuric acid, etc.) and irrigation water. This has completely destroyed the natric horizon leaving clay films on displaced peds and aggregates. This was originally proposed as a Natric subgroup as the soil has identifiable fragments of a natric horizon and is not Sodic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\n1.0 Ochric Epipedon--The zone from the surface to a depth of about 6 inches (Ap1 horizon).\n2.0 Clay films on displaced fragments of a natric horizon--The zone from 6 inches to a depth of about 47 inches (Ap2, Ap3 and Ap4 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
