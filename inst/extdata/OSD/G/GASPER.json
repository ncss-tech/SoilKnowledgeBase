    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Laboratory analyses of adjoining soils in addition to supporting field study place this soil with Andic surface properties.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from mid March to late December (285 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from early May to early December.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early July to early November (110 to 130 days) and is moist in all parts from early December to early June.  The particle size control section (4 to 24 inches) averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 6 percent to a depth of 16 inches and decreases regularly with depth.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 45 by sum of cations throughout the profile.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 the iron is 1.0 to 2.0 to a depth of 10 to 18 inches and decreases with depth.\nThe A horizon color is 7.5YR or 5YR 4/4 or 5/4 and 7.5YR 3/4 or 5YR 3/3 or 3/4 moist.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  Rock fragments are 10 to 20 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.  NaF pH is 10.5 to 12.  Moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc.\nThe 2Bt horizon color is 7.5YR and 5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4 and 5YR and 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4 moist.  Texture is sandy loam to sandy clay loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  Rock fragments are 10 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 50 percent stones.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.  NaF pH is 8.8 to 11.0, increasing with depth.  The Bt1 horizon has moist bulk density of 0.9 to 1.0 g/cc."
