  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 6 inches to the depth of the paralithic contact.  Texture of the A horizon is clay loam, clay or silty clay.  Texture of the B horizon is clay or silty clay.  Slickensides begin at a depth of about 15 inches.  When dry, these soils have cracks more than 1/2 of and inch wide that extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or more for 90 to 150 cumulative days during most years.  Cycles of microdepression and microknolls are repeated each 10 to 15 feet.  In undisturbed areas ther is gilgai microrelief with microknolls 4 to 12 inches higher than microdepressions.  The boundary between the A and B horizon is wavy with amplitude of 10 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon averages more than 12 inches thick in 50 percent or more of the pedon.  The color has hue of 10YR or N, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or less.  Slickensides and pressure faces range from none to very few.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in microdepressions and neutral to moderately alkaline in microknolls.  The boundary is clear wavy or gradual wavy.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Low chroma colors are not indicative of present day wetness. Slickensides range from few to common.  The reaction is neutral or slightly alkline alkaline.  It is very slightly effervescent in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a Bkss horizon.  It has colors with hue and value like the Bss horizon.  However, the chroma ranges to 4.  Calcium carbonate threads, masses, or concentrations range from common to many.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly or strongly cemented clayey tuff, clayey shale or fine grained tuffaceous sandstone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crawford, Dalco, and San Saba soils.  Dalco soils are very slightly to strongly effervescent with a paralithic contact of chalk.  Crawford and San Saba soils have lithic contact of limestone at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Crawford soils also have hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bss horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenvine soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping convex uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent, but are mainly 1 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from tuffaceous shales, siltstones, or fine grained sandstones of the Catahoula and similar geological formations.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches. Frost free days range from 260 to 290 days and elevation ranges from 200 to 550 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 48 to 64."

Arol, Burlewash, Falba, and Rehburg soils have argillic horizons, and do not have large slickensides.  Arol and Falba  soils are on lower wetter positions.  Burlewash and Rehburg soils  are on similar upland positions.  Shalba soils are on slightly higher convex positions.  Shalba soils do not have vertic properties."
