  "OVERVIEW": "The Gardellones series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metavolcanic rocks. The Gardellones soils are on hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 740 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
