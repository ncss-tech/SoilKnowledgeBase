  "OVERVIEW": "The Growset series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  The Growset soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
