The series is separated based primarily on the difference in soil moisture regime and sand mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in). (A1 and A2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (A2 and C1 horizons)\nMasses of oxidized iron: 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in). (C3 horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Characterization data from the type location (S03TX-273-001).  TAMU reference sample data for pH, salinity, sodicity and mineralogy on pedons S01TX-273-006 and S01TX-273-007.
