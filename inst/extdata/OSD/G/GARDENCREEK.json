  "OVERVIEW": "The Gardencreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
