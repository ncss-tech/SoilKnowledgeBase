Burnette soils have a solum less than 36 inches thick. Cochetop, Faim, Friana, Skutum, and Sudduth lack carbonates in the argillic horizon. Friana and Skutum have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon. Fulcher soils have more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the lower part of the upper 40 inches and have a mollic epipedon that is less than 24 inches thick. Guero soils are neutral to slightly acid in the Bt horizon and have mollic epipedons less thank 24 inches thick. Luna and Mayflower soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Leemorris, Mancos and Runlett soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Paulson, Perinos, and Richens soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the argillic horizon. Slights soils have a base saturation of less than 75 percent. Sudpeak soils are neutral or slightly acid in the Bt horizon and have a seasonal high water table at 3 to 6 feet. Teedown soils are slightly acid or moderately acid in the Bt horizon. Toponce soils are moderately acid or slightly acid. Bischoff soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grouseville soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 6,000 to 9,000 feet. These soils have formed in colluvium and alluvium from andesite, latite, and basalt with a component of loess. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches and the average annual air temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is from 30 to 60 days."
