Cambic horizon-the zone from 18 to 155 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and CBt horizons).\n3. Particle-size control section: the zone from 29 to 104 centimeters averages 25 percent clay, by weight, and 18% gravel by volume (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons). Particle size Family was determined from recalculated textures due to isotic mineralogy.\n4. Isotic feature: 15 bar water/clay is 0.69 or more and the NaF pH is greater than 9.1 in all horizons. Clay content for particle size family determination was calculated due to poor dispersion.\n5. Dystric subgroup:  base saturation between 25 and 75 centimeters below the mineral soil surface is 20 to 41, by sum of cations."
