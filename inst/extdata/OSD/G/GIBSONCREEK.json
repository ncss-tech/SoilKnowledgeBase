    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gibsoncreek soils are on linear to convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on ridges, mountain slopes and benches.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 300 to 500 meters. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 280 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (Oi and A horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon-the zone from 18 to 155 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and CBt horizons).\n3. Particle-size control section: the zone from 29 to 104 centimeters averages 25 percent clay, by weight, and 18% gravel by volume (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons). Particle size Family was determined from recalculated textures due to isotic mineralogy.\n4. Isotic feature: 15 bar water/clay is 0.69 or more and the NaF pH is greater than 9.1 in all horizons. Clay content for particle size family determination was calculated due to poor dispersion.\n5. Dystric subgroup:  base saturation between 25 and 75 centimeters below the mineral soil surface is 20 to 41, by sum of cations.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Pedon No. 05N0138.\nNASIS User Pedon ID 04CA601284\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
