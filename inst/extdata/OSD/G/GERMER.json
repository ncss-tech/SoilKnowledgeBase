  "OVERVIEW": "The Germer series consists of very deep, well drained, permeability is moderately slow over moderately rapid.  They are on fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium from andesite and rhyolite.  Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
