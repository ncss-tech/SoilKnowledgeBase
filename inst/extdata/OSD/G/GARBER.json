  "OVERVIEW": "The Garber series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial material weathered primarily from reddish arkosic beds of the Fountain and Lyons formations.  These soils are on alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and on small stream bottoms and have slopes ranging from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 40 inches thick.  The soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent but ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The control section is usually very gravelly coarse sandy loam and the fine earth fraction has 5 to 18 percent clay and more than 50 percent sand.  A high percentage of the sand fraction is angular and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter, but ranges from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon usually has hue of 5YR through 10R.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons.  Reaction is medium acid through mildly alkaline."

In addition, Lolo soils have medium to moderately fine textured matrix materials with small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand.  Mescalero soils have hard bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches."
