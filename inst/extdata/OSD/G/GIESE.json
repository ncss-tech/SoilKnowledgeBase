    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a densic contact with very firm dense glacial till is 40 to 80 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the upper loamy material including 0 to 2 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones and from 1 to 15 percent in the dense glacial till including 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 1 percent stones.  The depth to free carbonates is more than 80 inches.\nThe Oa or Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is muck or mucky peat.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR or is neutral, with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  This horizon has redoximorphic features in some pedons.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or silt loam, or their mucky analogues.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features are usually present.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam or silt loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe upper Bg or Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 4.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Some pedons have a Bt or Btg horizon that lacks the criteria for an argillic horizon.  The lower Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Bg and Bw horizons have fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue or 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma or 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  This horizon is restrictive to root penetration except in fractures.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Giese soils have plane or concave slopes in depressions or on broad flats on moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  This soil formed in a loamy mantle over very firm dense glacial till.  The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  The frost free season ranges from 90 to 145 days.  The elevation ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet above sea level."

Ahmeek, Automba, Brennyville, Hermantown, Milaca, Mora, Normanna, and Ronneby soils are all on higher better drained landscape positions.  The poorly drained Canosia soils are slightly higher lying and have a thinner upper dark layer.  The poorly drained Freer soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a silt cap.  The very poorly drained Twig soils have an organic layer 8 to 15 inches thick."
