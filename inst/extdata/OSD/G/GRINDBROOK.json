The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and 25 to 35 percent clay.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less is 30 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bw2 and BC, when present, horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist and dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 30 to 45 percent clay."

Climate is cool and wet in the winter and cool and moist in the summer with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days.
