The soils formed in outwash of mixed mineralogy with component of loess or volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. (9.4 degrees C). The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 25 inches (280 to 635 mm). The frost-free season is about 100 to 170 days."

Inchelium soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick, are coarse-silty, and are on terraces. Phoebe soils are coarse-loamy and are on outwash terraces. Scala soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are coarse-loamy, and are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Springdale soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are sandy-skeletal, and are on terraces and terrace breaks."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 40 cm (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 40 to 61 cm (Bw horizon)\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 40 cm (Ap and A horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A horizon, the Bw and part of the C horizon) with a weighted average of 39 percent rock fragments.\nThe boundary transition between the Bw and C horizon is more than 12.5 cm and does not meet contrasting family criteria. In addition, the Bw horizon contains more than 50 percent fine sand and coarser and therefore does not meet the loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal contrasting particle-size class.\nGarrison soils mapped in Kootenai County, ID., should be further investigated to determine surface texture (ashy silt loam vs. ashy loam).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this soil; NSSL pedon numbers 99P331, 99P332 and 08N0409.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
