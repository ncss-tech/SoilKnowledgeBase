  "OVERVIEW": "The Gimmi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed colluvium from basalt and  silty lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
