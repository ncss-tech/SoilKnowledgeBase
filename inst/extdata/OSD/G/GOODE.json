Bertolotti soils contain angular gneiss and granitic rock fragments and lack material of glacial origin. Cliffdell soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section. Deroux, Littlejohn, Mountaineer, Pheeney, and Umpa soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Mesahchie soils have an umbric epipedon.  Pitcher soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section, contain angular rock fragments of extrusive igneous origin, and lack material of glacial origin. Roxer soils have 7 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and contain basalt rock fragments. Scotties soils are deep to a lithic contact."

These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash, colluvium, and glacial drift over glacial drift. The climate consists of warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 1,600 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."

Inspiration soils are found on stable portions of the same valley walls,  have andic soil properties in horizons greater than 35 cm thick, and are ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal.  Lyall soils are found on active or young portions of alluvial fans and valley walls and lack andic soil properties.
