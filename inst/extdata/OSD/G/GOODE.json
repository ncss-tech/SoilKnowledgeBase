  "OVERVIEW": "The Goode series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and glacial drift over glacial drift on valley walls, alluvial fans, fan terraces, and Pleistocene terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent on alluvial fans, fan terraces, and terraces and 25 to 60 percent on valley walls. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
