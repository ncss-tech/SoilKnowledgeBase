  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sandstone or conglomerate bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 90 percent in individual horizons, but average 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section.  Surface rock coverage ranges from channery to rubbly.  Reaction is extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 2/1 or N 2/0.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the fine-earth material is loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe Bhs or Bh horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Many pedons have stains or Bs horizons with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth material is loam or sandy loam.  Consistence is friable to firm and slightly to moderately smeary.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine-earth material is loam or sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or firm and slightly to moderately smeary.  The Bs horizon of some pedons has red or brown mottles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the fine-earth material is loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Consistence is friable to firm."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gauley soils are on gently sloping to steep broad ridgetops and upper side slopes of mountains at 3500 to 5000 feet elevation.  These soils formed in residuum weathered mostly from acid sandstone but with inclusions of siltstone and shale.  Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent, but are dominantly less than 15 percent.  The climate is humid continental with long winter snow cover.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Annual frost-free days range from 90 to 130."

Areas of \"heath barrens\" are dominated by mountain laurel, huckleberry, blueberry, great rhododendron, rose and flame azaleas, red and black chokeberry, mountain ash, and mountain holly.  Ground cover consists of clubmoss, ground pine, ferns, and wood sorrel.  Red spruce stands are of commercial importance.  Other uses are primarily of an aesthetic or botanical nature."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  In West Virginia, these soils have formed on bedrock from the Kanawha and New River groups of the Pottsville Formation.  2. These soils were previously considered Leetonia (mesic) or included with Dekalb.  3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 3 to 9 inches (A and E horizons).\nb.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 9 to 23 inches (Bhs and Bs horizons).\nc.  Skeletal feature - approximately 56 percent (by volume) weighted average rock fragment in the 10 to 35 inch control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
