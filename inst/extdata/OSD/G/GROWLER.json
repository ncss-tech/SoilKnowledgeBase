  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Growler soils are on nearly level to gently sloping fan terraces at elevations of 500 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed rock sources, including rhyolite, andesite, basalt, rhyolitic and andesitic tuff with some influence from eolian sediments.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 75 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 4 to 10 inches, about one-half of which falls as summer thundershowers during the months of July, August, and September.  The frost-free period is 250 to 350 days."
