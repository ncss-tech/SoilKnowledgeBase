  "OVERVIEW": "The Growler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, saline soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed rocks.  Growler soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is 4 to 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.",

Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed rock sources, including rhyolite, andesite, basalt, rhyolitic and andesitic tuff with some influence from eolian sediments.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 75 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 4 to 10 inches, about one-half of which falls as summer thundershowers during the months of July, August, and September.  The frost-free period is 250 to 350 days."
