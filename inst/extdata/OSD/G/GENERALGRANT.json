  "OVERVIEW": "The Generalgrant series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum derived from granite. The Generalgrant soils are on stream terraces and drainageways on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1050 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
