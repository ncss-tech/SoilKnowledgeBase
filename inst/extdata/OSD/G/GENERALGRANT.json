  "OVERVIEW": "The Generalgrant series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived from granite. The Generalgrant soils are on stream terraces and drainageways on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1050 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
