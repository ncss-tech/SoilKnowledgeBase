  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerda series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on fans or flats on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

Maltese and Scairt soils occupy similar landscape positions as the Gerda soils.  Maltese soils have visible salts below a depth of 16 inches and are on micro-highs.  Scairt soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
