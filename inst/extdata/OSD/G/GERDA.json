They have fractured or shattered porcelanite at depths of 11 to 20 inches.  Kremlin and Patent soils are on fans.  They are fine-loamy and do not have a natric horizon.  Maltese and Scairt soils occupy similar landscape positions as the Gerda soils.  Maltese soils have visible salts below a depth of 16 inches and are on micro-highs.  Scairt soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
