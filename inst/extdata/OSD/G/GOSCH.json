Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from mid May to mid November and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early July to early October.  The soil moisture control section (20 to 45 inches) is dry in all parts from early July to mid September (range 75 to 90 days) and is moist in all parts from early November to mid June. The upper part is more recent tephra with 15 to 80 percent rock fragments.  The lower part is older and more strongly weathered tephra deposits with 35 to 90 percent rock fragments.  The particle size control section (9 to 29 inches) averages 27 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments, mostly stones and cobbles. NaF pH is 10.0 to 9.6 and decreases with depth.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 50 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/3 or 4/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2 or 5YR 3/2.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam or very stony sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 12 to 15 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel or stones, range from 15 to 60 percent. Bulk density is assumed to be less than 1.0.  Aluminum and 1/2 iron is assumed to range 1 to 1.5.\nThe AB horizon color is 7.5YR 5/4 or 10YR 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/4.  Texture is very stony sandy loam or extremely stony sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly stones,  range from 35 to 80 percent.
