  "OVERVIEW": "The Genoapeak series consists of very deep, soils that formed in colluvium over highly fractured trachyte bedrock. The Genoapeak soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
