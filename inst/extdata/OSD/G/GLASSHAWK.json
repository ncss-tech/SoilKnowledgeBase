  "OVERVIEW": "The Glasshawk series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Glasshawk soils are on relict beaches.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
