    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless artificially drained, the soil is saturated in some or all parts most of the year.  It is typically saline-alkali in most of the soil profile.  Organic matter is between 1 and 5 percent at the surface.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The upper 10 to 15 inches of the soil has moist matrix values of 3 or less.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noneffervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated lime.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1; 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/1; 5Y 2/1, 3/1, 3/2.  Mottles are distinct or prominent and have moist color of 2.5Y 4/2, 5/6; or 5Y 4/3, 4/4.  It is loam or clay loam with 12 to 35 percent clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noneffervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated lime.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5/2 and moist color of 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, or 4/2.  Mottles are distinct or prominent and have moist colors of 5Y 2.5/1, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3; 5GY 4/1; 5G 5/1 and 5BG 4/1.  This horizon is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent and lime is disseminated or in soft masses.  SAR is 10 to 50 but is at least 13 in the upper part.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 6/2, 5/2 and moist color of 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3.  Mottles have moist color of 5Y 4/1, 4/3, 5/3, 5/6; 5G 4/1; or 5BG 4/1.  This horizon ranges from loamy sand to clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It is slightly effervescent to violently and lime is disseminated or in soft masses."

The soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary and acid igneous rock.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and mild, somewhat moist winters.  The average annual precipitation varies from 7 to 8 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F; mean July temperature is 83 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F.
