  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Glencarb soils are on flood plains, low stream terraces, and basin floors. These soils formed in mixed alluvium with a large component of calcareous materials. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 2,400 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 63 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 300 days."
