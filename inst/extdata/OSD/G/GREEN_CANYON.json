(9 to 11 inches thick)\nA12--0 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular  structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)\nCl--16 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; very strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.            (7 to 10 inches thick)\nIIC2--23 to  42 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; very strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).\nType Location: Cache County, Utah; 350 feet north and 500 feet west of the center of sec. 24, T.12N., R.lE.\nRange in Characteristics: The mollic epipedon ranges from 11 to 19 inches thick. Depth to the IIC2 horizon ranges from about 19 to 28 inches. The rock fragments are mainly gravel and cobble size, rounded limestone or dolomite rock fragments, and commonly increase in number with increasing depth. The average texture of the control section is very gravelly fine sandy loam with 35 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F. Lime content ranges from 40 to 80 percent. The soils are moist 55 to 65 percent of the time, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the 4 to 12 inch section in summer and early autumn.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It contains 1 to 3.5 percent organic matter. This horizon has weak fine to medium granular structure. It is strongly to very strongly calcareous and is 11 to 18 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from very gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam to very gravelly loamy sand with 35 to 80 percent rock fragments. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The soils formed in alluvium from limestone and dolomite. The climate is dry subhumid; mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F., average summer temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 160 days."
