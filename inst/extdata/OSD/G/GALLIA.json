  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 108 inches.  Volume of coarse fragments, commonly weathered sandstone, shale, quartzite, and some crystalline pebbles 2 mm to 2.5 cm in size, and less commonly 2.5 cm to 75 cm in size, are 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 25 percent in the B, and 0 to 30 percent in the C.  The particle size control section commonly is 20 to 32 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Skeletans are evident in the lower part of the B horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have a thin horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or loam.  It is very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon commonly has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR with subhorizons of 7.5YR that are most common in the upper part, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It commonly is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or their gravelly analogs, but some pedons have silt loam in the upper part or thin subhorizons of silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the lower part.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC or 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogs.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is stratified loamy sand, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs with strata less than 5 inches thick of sandy clay loam or loam.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Portia series in the same family and the Allegheny, Elk, Elkinsville, Negley, Parke, Wheeling, and Williamsburg series.  Portia soils have black concretions in the upper argillic horizon and lack skeletans in the lower B horizon.  Allegheny soils lack reddish hue and have base saturation of less than 35 percent. Elk, Elkinsville, and Wheeling soils typically have sola less than 60 inches thick, lack reddish hue, and have mixed mineralogy, and in addition, Elk and Elkinsville soils are fine-silty.  Negley soils have mixed mineralogy and contain more gravel.  Parke soils are fine-silty, have mixed mineralogy, and lack skeletans in the lower part of the solum.  Williamsburg soils have mixed mineralogy and lack reddish hue."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gallia soils are on interfluves of high terraces undergoing dissection and have slope gradients of 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in stratified old alluvium and some lacustrine sediments in wide preglacial valleys that in some places have a silt or loess mantle up to 18 inches in thickness.  Some strata include pebbles and fragments of sandstone, shale, quartzite, and crystalline rocks.  Most of the coarse fragments except quartzite and chert are weathered and disintegrate readily.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 44 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from about 52 to 56 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Licking, Otwell, and Vincent soils on high terraces and the Dekalb, Gilpin, Summitville, and Upshur soils.  Licking and Vincent soils have fine textured argillic horizons and underlying materials, and in addition, Licking soils are moderately well drained.  Otwell soils are moderately well drained, have fragipans, and are on broader, less sloping areas.  Dekalb, Gilpin, Summitville, and Upshur soils formed in residuum weathered from the underlying sandstone, siltstone, and shale and are on nearby dissected uplands."
