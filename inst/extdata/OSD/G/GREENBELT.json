  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the fill materials is 100 cm or more. Total coarse fragments range from 1 to 34 percent with less than 10 percent (absolute) human artifacts.  Surface and subsurface textures include sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, and silt loam. Thin layers of coarser textured materials may be present.\nThe ^A or ^Ap horizon have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Consistence is very friable, friable, or firm. Pieces of B horizon material are commonly mixed in. Structure is granular or subangular blocky, but may be fine platy in reclaimed areas where the surface has been compacted. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe ^Bw horizons, if present, have hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Structure is subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. Pieces of other B or A horizons are commonly mixed in. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have ^BC horizons that are massive with plate-like divisions that inhibit roots from penetrating ped interiors, but allow roots to grow between the plates. Consistence is friable or firm. The other properties are similar to the Bw horizons.\nThe ^C horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. They are massive and may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable to firm. Reaction ranges from strongly alkaline to strongly acid.\nThe 2Ab and 2Bwb horizons, if present, have properties similar to the corresponding horizons in nearby undisturbed soils."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Olinville series are in the same family.  Olinville soils formed in a moderately deep mantle of loamy human-transported materials over alluvium.  Flatbush and North Meadow series are in closely-related families.  Flatbush soils formed in a moderately deep mantle of loamy human-transported materials over glaciofluvial deposits.  North Meadow soils formed in a moderately deep mantle of loamy human-transported materials over till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Greenbelt soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping anthropogenic landforms.  These landforms may have been constructed over a variety of natural landforms including tidal marsh, inland wetlands, or various upland landforms.  These soils formed in human-transported material 1 meter or more thick. Some pedons occur as backfilled excavations in cemeteries. The mantle of human-transported material contains less than 10 percent artifacts (e.g., plastic, glass, bricks, concrete, and metal). The human-transported material is dominantly from locally-excavated upland materials (e.g., alluvium, till, glaciofluvial deposits, or eolian deposits). Rock fragments are derived mainly from sedimentary and metamorphic rock types. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Higher slopes may occur when the soil is formed in unleveled mounds or where fill is used to create rolling topography on golf courses. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Associated human-altered and human-transported soils are Canarsie, Centralpark, Ebbets, Flatbush, Laguardia, Ladyliberty, North Meadow, Olinville, and Secaucus soils. Canarsie, Flatbush, North Meadow, and Olinville soils have less than 100 centimeters of human-transported material. Centralpark soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments within the control section. Ebbets soils average greater than 10 percent human artifacts in the control section. Laguardia and Secaucus soils have greater than 35 percent combined rock fragments and artifacts in the control section. Associated naturally-deposited soils are Boonton, Charlton, Cheshire, and Paxton soils.  All of these soils contain less than 50 centimeters of human-transported material at the surface.  These soils often serve as the source of fill materials that form Greenbelt soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium on vegetated slopes less than 8 percent, and high to very high on vegetated slopes 8 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class higher where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high, but may be moderately low if the soil has been compacted."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Depending on management, these soils may be vegetated primarily with herbaceous plants including raspberry, common reed, and mugwort or by turfgrass if part of a recreation area.  Less managed areas are typically vegetated with native and non-native forest vegetation.  The more compacted areas support sparse populations of various grasses, annuals, and perennials that invade disturbed/stressed areas. Recreational use is unlikely in park areas where the surface is unsmoothed, or where the surface stones and boulders have not been removed."
