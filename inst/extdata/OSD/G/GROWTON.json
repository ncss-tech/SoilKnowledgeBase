  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is typically 24 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent by volume in parts of the solum.  Most of the fragments are gravel size with some cobblestones and occasional boulders present. They are of mixed lithology but mostly igneous.  A horizons in some pedons contain as little as 2 percent rock fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.   It is neutral to strongly acid. Some pedons have thin B & A horizons as expressed by ped coatings and interfingering.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 4.  In pedons having matrix chroma greater than 2 there is some mottling with chroma of 2 or less in peds or on faces of peds within the upper 10 inches of the Bt.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy, or loam.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  It has few to many thin or moderately thick dark brown clay films on faces of peds and voids.  It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and less commonly 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam or loam with thin coarser textured strata common.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have Bk horizons.  Some pedons have BC and/or C horizons."

The soils formed in calcareous sandy loam and loam glacial till.  The mean annual temperature is from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1475 feet."
