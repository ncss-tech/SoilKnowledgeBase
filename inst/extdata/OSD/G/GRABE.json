  "OVERVIEW": "The Grabe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium.  Grabe soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
