  "OVERVIEW": "The Govey series consists of moderately deep to a cemented layer, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium over dense glacial till.  Govey soils are on glacial valleys and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
