  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature varies from 54 to 59 degrees F.  The moisture control section (from 3 inches to the lithic contact) is dry in all parts about mid May and remains dry until mid October (130-150 days).  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.  The control section has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments and averages 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/2, 5/4, 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 4/3, 4/4, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4, or 3/2.  It is loam or clay loam and may be gravelly, cobbly, stony, very gravelly or very stony with rock fragments ranging from 10 to 50 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 5/4, or 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/3, or 5/6. It is 10YR 3/4, 4/4 or 7.5YR 4/4 moist.  It is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam and may be very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or very stony.  Clay content averages 1 or 2 percent more than the A horizon, in some pedons.  Not all pedons have clay films."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goulding soils are on hills and mountains.   Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  These soils formed from metavolcanic rocks, mostly greenstone, or metasedimentary rocks.  Elevation ranges from 1,500 to 5,000 feet.  At elevations below 3,500 feet, these soils  are on north or sheltered aspects or have semidense or dense vegetative cover. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 25 to 60 inches.  Some precipitation occurs as snow on the higher ridges. Seasonal snowfall ranges from a few inches to about 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees to 57 degrees F; The average January temperature is about 40 degrees F; and the average July temperature is about 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 100 to 235 days."
