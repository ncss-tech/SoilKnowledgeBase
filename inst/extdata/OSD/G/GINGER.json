    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, are saturated for prolonged periods during the winter, and are dry less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer.. The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 degrees F. Soil depth is over 60 inches, but rooting depth is limited by the seasonal water table. Redoximorphic features and/or a soil matrix color moist of 2 or less occur at depths of 12 to 20 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick  Depth to the 3C horizon is below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Value of 3 moist occurs below 12 inches in some pedons.  Texture is medial silt loam.  Clay content by field estimate is 18 to 25 percent.  It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 10 percent rounded paragravel.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, P retention is 90 to 100 percent, and the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 2 to 3 percent.  Organic carbon is  6 to 10 percent.\nThe 2BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  Texture is silty clay loam. Clay content is 30 to 35 percent.  It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 10 percent rounded paragravel.\nThe 2Bw or 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 10 percent rounded paragravel.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry and is variegated.  Texture is extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loamy sand, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Clay content is 3 to 15 percent.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ginger soils are on nearly level or concave positions on stream terraces. Elevations range from 20 to 200 feet. The soils formed of mixed alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog and low clouds.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 61 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 260 days."

Chitwood and Knappa soils lack a melanic epipedon and have a moist soil bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter in the surface.  Hebo soils are poorly drained. Knappa soils are well drained and are fine-silty. Quillamook soils are well drained and have clay contents of less than 35 percent in the texture control section.  All of these soils are on coastal valley and marine terraces."
