The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."

Astrobee soils have pedogenic gypsum masses within 7 inches of the soil surface, Harses soils do not have salic horizons and have a water table greater than 40 inches. Transformer soils have electrical conductivities ranging from 4 to 18 dS/m."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Gyplaya soils are normally devoid of vegetation due to annual ponding. Vegetation occurs in a thin strip along the edge of the playas where ponding does not occur. Native vegetation is inland salt grass, iodine bush and alkali sacaton."
