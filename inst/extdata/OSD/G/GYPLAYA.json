  "OVERVIEW": "The Gyplaya series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian sands. These nearly level soils are on playas bordering gypsum dune fields. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
