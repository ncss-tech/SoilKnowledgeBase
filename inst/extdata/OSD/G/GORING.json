    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 32 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the Al, Bl and B2t horizons is 45 to 60 inches or more. The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at about 20 inches depth is 60 to 65 degrees F. The cation exchange capacity/clay ratio is about 0.6 to 0.8. The soils are usually moist but are dry in the 4 to 12 inch depth for 60 days or more during the summer months.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular or thin to thick platy structure in the upper part.  It is slightly acid to neutral and is 6 to 14 inches thick.\nThe B1 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or light silty clay loam, with up to 20 percent gravel and cobble. It has weak to strong, fine to coarse angular or subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid to neutral. The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 and only the upper 5 to 15 inches has the combined dark color and required organic matter content for a mollic epipedon. It is clay, silty clay or heavy silty clay loam. It has weak to strong, medium to coarse prismatic, angular or subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid to neutral.  Clay films are common to many, thin to moderately thick."

Ant Flat soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have horizons of carbonate accumulation. Broadhead and Prag soils have argillic horizons with 10YR hue. Also, Prag soils have an abrupt boundary at the top of the argillic horizon. Deer Creek soils have strong horizons of carbonate accumulation and have cobbly argillic horizons. Henefer soils have cobbly clay argillic horizons. Nebeker soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 degrees F. or more. Yeates Hollow soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have very cobbly clay argillic horizons with more than 35 percent coarse fragments."

These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from sandstone and quartzite. The climate is moist subhumid, mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches. The frost-free season is 80 to 100."
