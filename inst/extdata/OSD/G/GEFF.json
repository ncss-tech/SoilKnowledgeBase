  "REVDATE": "03/2011",
  "STATES": "IL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Geff series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 24 to 40 inches (61 to 102 cm) of loess or other silty material and the underlying stratified loamy outwash on low stream terraces and flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F. (12 degrees C.), and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches (1067 mm).",
