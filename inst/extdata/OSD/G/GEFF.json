Fishhook soils average more than 35 percent clay in the\nlower part of the series control section. Bunkum and Glenford soils average less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Keene soils have weathered bedrock at depths of 40 to 84 inches. Reesville, Sugarvalley and Torox soils have carbonates above a depth of 60 inches. Xenia soils average more than 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the lower part of the series control section."
