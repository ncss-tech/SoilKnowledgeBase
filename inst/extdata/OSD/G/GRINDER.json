    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aftaden (NM), Copperworld (CA), Sparkhule (CA), Stonegold (CA) and Zyplar (NV) series. Aftaden soils are formed in eolian sediments and material from basaltic sources, have mean annual precipitation of about 203 millimeters and are characterized by 5YR hues throughout the profile. Copperworld soils are formed from metamorphic rocks. Sparkhule soils average more than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Stonegold soils are formed in volcanic residuum. Zyplar soils are formed in volcanic ash and rhyolitic tuff, average 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle size control section and have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C."
