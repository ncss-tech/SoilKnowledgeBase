  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 22 to 35 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Volume of cobble ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout.  Mudflow lenses or remnant discontinuous disoriented varves occur in individual horizons in many pedons.   Redox accumulations occur in the glossic horizon and, in some pedons, in the upper part of the argillic horizon (Bt).  Saturation occurs in these horizons at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nGichigami soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color like the E horizon described above.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but, in some pedons, it is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but, in some pedons, it is silt loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue to 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but, in some pedons, it is silt loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color, texture and reaction like the BC horizon described above."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1200 feet."

The well drained Bohemian soils, the somewhat poorly drained Brimley soils, and the poorly drained Bruce soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the soil formed in stratified lacustrine deposits.  The well drained Denomie soils and the somewhat poorly drained Oronto soils form a drainage sequence with Gichigami soils."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover are the principle crops.  Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, white pine, quaking aspen and paper birch.  Common understory species are American hazel, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
