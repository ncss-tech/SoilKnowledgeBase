  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  Depth to the 2Apb horizon ranges from 20 to 70 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the control section and 0 to 10 percent in the substratum.  They are usually coal fragments or rounded gravels.  Soil reaction:  unlimed reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate granular and consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is single grain or massive and consistence is friable to loose.\nThe 2Apb horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak of moderate granular and consistence is friable or very friable.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have 2Bwgb horizons with similar characteristics to 2Bwb horizons but chromas ranges from 1 through 4 and occur at depths greater than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gibraltar soils are on floodplains that extend from the Appalachian Plateau through the Valley and Ridge Province and the Northern Piedmont to the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils developed in recent alluvial coal deposits originating from mining operations upstream overlying older floodplain soils.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40-50 inches, mean annual air temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. and a growing season of 150 to 200 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Mollic feature:  Although the soil has a thick dark surface, it is not considered a mollic epipedon because the dark color is derived from the coal, does not presumably meet the phosphate criterion and has an age of greater than holocene in the surface to 30 inches.\nb. Fluvents - organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth and is greater than 0.2 percent at a depth of at least 50 inches below the surface.\n2008 Revision was to update pedon description\nPrior revision  7/2001 NJC-EAW-RP\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
