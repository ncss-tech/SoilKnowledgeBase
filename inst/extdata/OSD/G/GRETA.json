  "OVERVIEW": "The Greta series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are flats on the coastal plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in). and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
