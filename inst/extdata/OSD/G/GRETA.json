During the update soil survey of MLRA 150A and initial soil survey of Goliad County, some areas previously mapped as Orelia clearly showed signs of higher salinity in plant communities and growth.  Lab data and pedon descriptions confirmed a difference in these soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 13 to 64 cm (5 to 25 in).  (Btn1 and Btn2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in).  (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 13 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in).
