  "OVERVIEW": "The Grenet series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic tuff with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. Depth to volcanic tuff is 20 to 40 inches.   Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Phosphate retention is 30 to 65 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron is between 0.5 and 1.5 percent in the less than 2.0mm fraction.   There is 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar moisture is less than 15 percent on air dried samples and less than 30 percent on undried samples.  Grenet soils have a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90g/cc.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.   It has 35 to 50 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand with 50 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles."
