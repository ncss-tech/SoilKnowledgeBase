  "OVERVIEW": "The Glacierpoint series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granitic rock. Glacierpoint soils are on the slopes of mountains and moraines, on bedrock benches, on talus slopes associated with glacial-valley walls, and in joints and fractures of bedrock on mountainsides. Slope is 0 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,245 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",

The vegetation according to Preliminary Description of Terrestrial Natural Community of California, Robert F. Holland and Fish and Game, State of California, 1986 is Lodge pole Pine Forest (86110), Red Fir Forest (85310), Jeffrey Pine-Fir Forest (85210), Sierra White Fir Forest (84200), Red Fir Forest (85310), White Fir mixed Coniferous Forest (84232), and Mountain Hemlock Forest (86800).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - The zone from 3 to 69 centimeters (A and Bw horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 28 to 103 centimeters (A2, Bw, and C1 horizons).\nSome pedons may have Oi, Oe, and/or Oa horizons.\nSeries updated in 2021 to include ranges of Glacierpoint soils described in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Climate ranges and vegetation were not updated at this time.\nSeries previously classified as Sandy-skeletal, isotic Xeric Dystrocryepts. Updated in 2021.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL lab data from pedon number 97P0120 (Pedon ID: 96CA109004) and 18N0946 (Pedon ID: S2012CA7921062) are available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory at the National Soil Survey Center in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nSoil Classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
