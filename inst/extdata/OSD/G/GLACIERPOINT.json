  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glacierpoint series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granitoid rock. Glacierpoint soils are on the slopes of mountains and moraines, on bedrock benches, and in joints and fractures of bedrock on mountainsides. Slope is 0 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches (1,245 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F (6.7 degrees C).",
