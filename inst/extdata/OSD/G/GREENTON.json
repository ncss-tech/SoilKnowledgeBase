  "REVDATE": "02/97",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenton series consists of very deep and deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in thin loess and the underlying residuum from clay shales and thinly bedded limestone. These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 5. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 8. It is silty clay loam or silty clay with evidence of shale fragments. Iron masses or depletions with both high and low chroma are distinct or prominent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has mixed colors with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6. It is silty clay or clay with coarse fragments of limestone lithology ranging from 0 to 25 percent by volume. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. 2Cr horizons may occur below a depth of 40 inches."
