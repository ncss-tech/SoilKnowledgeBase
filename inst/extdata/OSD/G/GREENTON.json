  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to clayey shales is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 5. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 8. It is silty clay loam or silty clay with evidence of shale fragments. Iron masses or depletions with both high and low chroma are distinct or prominent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has mixed colors with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6. It is silty clay or clay with coarse fragments of limestone lithology ranging from 0 to 25 percent by volume. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. 2Cr horizons may occur below a depth of 40 inches."

The soils formed in loess and in the underlying residuum from clay shales and thinly bedded limestone. Slope gradients range from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F."
