Berdugo and Spangenburg soils lack calcic horizons.  Borda, Reba and Verdico soils are slightly acid or neutral in the argillic horizon.  Bowns, Chardoton and Sorf soils have MAST greater than 10.6 degrees C.  Bowns, Mahala and Verdico soils are moderately deep to lithic or paralithic contacts.  Brent, Chardoton, Gooding and Phing soils have \"E\" horizons.  Poall soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gariper soils are nearly level to sloping on fan terraces at elevations of 1,100 to 1,620 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 330 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 90 to 125 days."

The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 5/93.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - The zone 0 to 23 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon and particle-size control section - The zone 23 to 56 cm (Bt and Btq horizons).\nAbrupt textural change - At 23 cm, est. 21% increase in clay in less than 2.5 cm (top of Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon - The zone 56 to 119 cm (Bkq horizon).\nDuripan - The zone 119 to 152 cm or more (Bkqm horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
