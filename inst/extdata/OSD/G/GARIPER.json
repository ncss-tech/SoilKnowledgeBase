  "OVERVIEW": "The Gariper series consist of deep to duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Gariper soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
