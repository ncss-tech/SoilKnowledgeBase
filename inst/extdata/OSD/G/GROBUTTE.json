The soils formed in gravelly or very gravelly alluvium or colluvium.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,500 feet. Average annual precipitation for the area is about 15 to 20 inches, but snow is blown from these soils, and snowmelt runs off rapidly. The mean annual air temperature is about 35 percent to 38 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 60 to 90 days."
