Kanza and Plev soils are in warmer areas that have a mean annual temperature greater than 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F). Kingsville soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon in the series control section. Marlake soils are in drier areas that have a mean annual precipitation of less than 737 mm (29 inches). Pay and Vestaburg soils have more than 3 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Tobico have carbonates within a depth of 46 cm (18 inches) and do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon in the series control section."

The Glendora soils formed in sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 991 mm (29 to 39 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 11.1 degrees C (41 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 115 to 220 days. Elevation is 175 to 470 meters (575 to 1,540 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Abscota and the somewhat poorly drained Algansee soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and are in a drainage sequence with Glendora soils. Cohoctah soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Glendora soils on flood plains and have a sand content that averages less than 70 percent in the particle-size control section. Sloan soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Glendora soils on flood plains and have a clay content that averages 22 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. These soils are frequently or occasionally flooded for brief to very long duration. These soils are subject to occasional ponding up to 15 cm (0.5 feet) for brief duration."
