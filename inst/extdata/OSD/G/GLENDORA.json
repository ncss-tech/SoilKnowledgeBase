  "OVERVIEW": "The Glendora series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level areas or slight depressions, including old drainageways, and on flood plains in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
