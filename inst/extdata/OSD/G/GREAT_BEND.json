  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches and extends into the Bw horizon in most pedons.  Depth to carbonate ranges from 10 to 32 inches thick.  The particle size control section contains a uniform fine sand distribution and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 and 1.5 or less moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have relic mottles.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  R ange of CaCO3 is 15 to 25 percent. Some pedons have BCk horizons.  Some pedons have relic mottles.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and typically is varved with very thin strata of very fine sand to clay in the lower part. Stratified loamy sand or loamy glacial till is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons. Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. Carbonate occurs as both disseminated and accumulations. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Few to common salts are visible in some pedons.  Many krotovina are in the Bk and C horizons of some pedons. Few to common mottles of high chroma typically are in the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Brandt, Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Putney series in the same family.  The Kranzburg soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Brandt and Poinsett soils have an uneven fine sand distribution in the particle size control section and contain more sand and coarse fragments in the series control section.  Putney soils have gypsum and other salts within a depth of 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Great Bend soils are on glacial lake and delta plains.  Slopes are convex and most have gradients of less than 6 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  Great Bend soils formed in silty, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments of silt sized particles but with varves of very fine sand or clay sized particles.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aberdeen, Beotia, Exline, Harmony, Nahon, Tonka, and Zell soils. Aberdeen, Exline, Harmony, and Nahon soils are on broad flats. Aberdeen, Exline, and Nahon soils have a natric horizon, and Harmony soil has an argillic horizon. Beotia soils have mollic epipedons greater than 16 inches thick and are slightly lower on the landscape.  The poorly drained Tonka soils have an albic horizon and are in closed depressions. Zell soils are coarse-silty and are on the steeper slopes, particularly along steep sides of stream valleys crossing the lake plain."
