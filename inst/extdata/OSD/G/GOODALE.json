    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry from about April 30 to November 30, and are moist in some or all parts the rest of the time. Aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric. The soil temperature is above 8.3 degrees C from about March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.  The mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 17.8 degrees C.  The surface rock fragment coverage ranges from 10 to 90 percent with 0 to 50 percent boulders and stones, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.  Some boulders exceed 1.83 meters in diameter.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 6/3, 6/4 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/3 or 3/3.  Textures are loamy fine sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand and bouldery loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent with 3 to 25 percent boulders and stones, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 10 to 35 percent gravel.  The organic carbon content is 0.2 to 0.4 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 6/3, 6/4, 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3 or 4/4.  Textures are loamy coarse sand, loamy sand with gravelly, very gravelly, very cobbly, very stony, extremely gravelly or extremely stony modifiers.  In some profiles, lenses of sandy loam are present.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent for the 25 to 102 cm control section with 10 to 50 percent boulders and stones, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, 10 to 35 percent gravel."

They are dissected with some drainageways and shallow washes.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,130 to 1,680 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 250 mm.  The mean January temperature is about 2.8 degrees C; mean July temperature is 25.6 degrees C; mean annual temperature is 13.9 to 16.1 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 140 to 200 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 18 cm (A1, A2)\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  The soil lacks a subsurface diagnostic horizon because:  no clay films, no segregated carbonate and no structure.\n2.  Organic carbon content is assumed to be less than 0.6 percent and is assumed to decrease regularly with depth.\n3.  Mixed mineralogy is assumed.\n4.  Particle-size control section is sandy-skeletal (more than 35 percent rock fragments by volume).  Textural analysis using the hydrometer method employed; boulder, stone, and cobble content estimated by visual inspection; gravel content determined using number 10 sieve and water displacement method.\n5.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric; estimated using Thornthwaite water balance method on local meteorological data, soil moisture data, and vegetation indicators.  MAP is 10 to 25 cm--determined by extrapolating between weather stations and using vegetation as indicators.\n6.  The soil temperature regime is on the cool end of thermic.  MAST is 15 to 17.8 degrees C.  This is extrapolated from actual soil temperature data over the past years using 12 month averages and Rod Arkley's formula.  These soils are in MLRA-29.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
