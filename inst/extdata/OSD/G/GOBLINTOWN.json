    "content": "REMARKS: Goblintown soils were previously mapped as inclusions in Littlejoe, Buffstat, and Bugley soils. Levels of total carbon are high due to the influence of graphitic parent materials; however organic matter from plant residue is thought to be similar to adjacent soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 20 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)\nParalithic contact--bedrock contact at 37 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)\nParalithic Materials--the zone from 37 to 80 inches (Cr layer)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 47 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number: 99P0442; User Pedon ID: 99VA141005).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
