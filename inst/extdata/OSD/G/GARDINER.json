  "OVERVIEW": "The Gardiner series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains, stream levees and low stream terraces.  They formed in coarse-textured, mixed alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 12 and 35 inches within the 4 month period following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The soil is strongly or moderately acid.  There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand with few thin strata of finer materials in some pedons.  In some pedons individual sand grains are black.  Below depth of 40 inches the texture ranges from fine sand, gravelly sand to very gravelly sand."

The soils formed in coarse-textured mixed alluvium derived from rocks high in ferromagnesium and low in quartz.  The climate is humid and cool with a mean annual precipitation of 60 to 90 inches.  Mean January temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 290 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features;\nOchric epipedon\nIrregular decrease in organic carbon with depth\nThis soil needs review to validate the psamment placement.  The series was orginally classified as Fluventic Umbric Dystrochrepts.  It was later changed to Typic Udipsamments base on lack of umbric epipedon, no cambic horizon and coarse textures.  Based on flood plain location the coarse textures throughout the profile need to be confirmed.  If finer texture occur the series should be classified as Mollic Udifluvents."
