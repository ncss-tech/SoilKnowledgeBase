  "STATES": "MT,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerdrum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glacialfluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, till plains, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
