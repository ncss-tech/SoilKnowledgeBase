Mean annual precipitation ranges from 508 to 914 mm (20 to 36 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). The difference between mean annual summer and mean annual winter temperature ranges from 6.1 to 15.0 degrees C (43 to 59 degrees F)."

Covert, Granby, Kingsville, and Pipestone soils form a common drainage sequence with Grattan soils. The moderately well drained Covert and somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are on nearly level areas of the landscape while the very poorly drained Kingsville and Granby soils are in depressional areas. Chelsea, Kaleva, Oakville, and Plainfield soils are common associates and are on similar landscape positions."

Specialty crops are grown on intensively managed areas. Native vegetation is dominantly quaking aspen, eastern white pine, red maple, white oak, northern red oak, and black oaks."

Albic horizon: from a depth of 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) (E horizon).\n3. Spodic horizon: from a depth of 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) (Bs1 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
