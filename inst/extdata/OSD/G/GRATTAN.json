  "OVERVIEW": "The Grattan series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy drift on lake plains, outwash plains, moraines, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 mm (35 in), and mean annual temperature is about 9.0 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Covert, Granby, Kingsville, and Pipestone soils form a common drainage sequence with Grattan soils. The moderately well drained Covert and somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are on nearly level areas of the landscape while the very poorly drained Kingsville and Granby soils are in depressional areas. Chelsea, Kaleva, Oakville, and Plainfield soils are common associates and are on similar landscape positions."

Albic horizon: from a depth of 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) (E horizon).\n3. Spodic horizon: from a depth of 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) (Bs1 horizon)."
