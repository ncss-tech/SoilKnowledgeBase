Slope gradients are usually less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent.  Girard soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1143 mm (36 to 45 inches), and mean annual temperature is 14 to 19 degrees C (57 to 67 degrees F).  Elevation is 245 to 325 meters (804 to 1066 feet).  Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index is 64 to 80."
