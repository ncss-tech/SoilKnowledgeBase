Elevations range from 120 to 1,000 meters (395 to 3,330 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers, and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
