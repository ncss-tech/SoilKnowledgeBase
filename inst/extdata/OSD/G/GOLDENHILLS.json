  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldenhills series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitoid or gneissic rocks. Goldenhills soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
