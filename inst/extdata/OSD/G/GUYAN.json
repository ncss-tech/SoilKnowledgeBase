  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is dominantly 40 to 60 inches, but ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the solum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the Ap and BA horizons and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bt, BC, and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Small iron and manganese concretions are common in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  The Bt horizon has weak to moderate, medium to coarse subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have medium to coarse prismatic structure that parts to subangular blocky structure.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is 0 to 16 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  In some pedons the C horizon is stratified and may contain strata of silty clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Prout series. Closely similar are the Cavode, Evendale, Tygart, and Tyler series. Prout soils are moderately deep and have bedrock within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Cavode, Evendale, and Tygart, soils have clayey particle-size control sections.  Tyler soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and a fragipan."

These soils have formed in alluvium derived from interbedded shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F."

Allegheny, Kanawha, Cotaco, Markland, Monagahela, Purdy, and Tyler soils are on landscape positions similar to Guyan soils.  Allegheny and Kanawha soils are well drained.  Cotaco, Markland, and Monongahela soils are moderately well drained.  Purdy soils are poorly to very poorly drained.  Tyler soils are somewhat poorly drained and fine-silty.  Monongahela and Tyler soils have fragipans.  Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, and Upshur soils formed in residuum on uplands and are well drained.  Ernest, Jefferson, and Vandalia soils are on colluvial fans and footslopes.  Ernest soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Jefferson and Vandalia soils are well drained.  Chagrin and Pope soils formed in alluvium on flood plains and are well drained."
