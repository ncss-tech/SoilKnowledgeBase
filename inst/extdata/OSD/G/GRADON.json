  "OVERVIEW": "The Gradon series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Gradon soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
