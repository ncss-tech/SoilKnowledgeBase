  "OVERVIEW": "The Grizzlycreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. Grizzlycreek soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
