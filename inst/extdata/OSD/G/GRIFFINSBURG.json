  "OVERVIEW": "The Griffinsburg series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as arkosic metasandstone, meta-arkose and metagraywacke on the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Northern Piedmont Major Land Resource Area. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 7 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees.",

Depth to lithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 55 percent. Rock fragments are mainly fine, medium and coarse metasedimentary\nand metaquartzite gravels, metasedimentary cobbles and metasedimentary stones\nSome pedon have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. It is fine sandy loam or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Rock fragments are mainly fine, medium and coarse metasedimentary\nand metaquartzite gravels and metasedimentary cobbles\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Rock fragments are mainly medium and coarse metasedimentary and\nmetaquartzite gravels and metasedimentary cobbles.\nSome pedons have a C horizon, with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 20 to 50 percent.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Bremo, Cardiff, Cataska, Greenlee, Handshoe, Konnarock, Northcove, Petros, and Watt soils are competing series. Cataska and Petros soils have paralithic contact above 20 inches. Cataska soils developed in residuum of low-grade metasedimentary rock. Petros soils developed in residuum of shale and siltstone. Bremo and Konnarock soils have lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Bremo soils develop from residuum of dark-colored rock. Konnarock soils develop in residuum of rythmite and tillite. Greenlee, Handshoe, and Northcove soils are greater than 60 inches to lithic or paralithic contact. Greenlee develop in colluvium and alluvium of felsic to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rock. Handshoe soils develop in colluvium of sandstone. Northcove soils develop in colluvium of low-grade metasedimentary rocks. Cardiff soils develop from residuum of slate, phyllite and other fine-grained rock. Watt soils develop in residuum of graphitic rock.\nParker soils are in a related family and may become competitors as their classification is upgraded to the eighth edition of soil taxonomy. Parker soils have lithic and paralithic contact at greater than 60 inches and develop in residuum of granite gneiss."
