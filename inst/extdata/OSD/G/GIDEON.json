  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canalou, Farrenburg, Lilbourn, Roellen, Sharkey, Sikeston, and Wardell soils. Canalou, Farrenburg, and Lilbourn soils are better drained, have browner colors, and generally more acid reactions. These soils are on higher positions. Roellen soils have a mollic epipedon, contain more clay, and are in a similar position. Sharkey soils are clayey throughout and generally are on lower positions. Sikeston soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and are on similar positions. Wardell soils have an argillic horizon and are on higher positions."
