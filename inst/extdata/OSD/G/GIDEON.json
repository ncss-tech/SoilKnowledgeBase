  "REVDATE": "02/2013",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gideon series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and depressional areas. Slopes are generally less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",

Roellen soils have a mollic epipedon, contain more clay, and are in a similar position. Sharkey soils are clayey throughout and generally are on lower positions. Sikeston soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and are on similar positions. Wardell soils have an argillic horizon and are on higher positions."
