  "STATES": "NH,VT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Groveton series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces.  They formed in loamy deposits overlying sandy sediments.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying material.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface and upper part of the subsoil and from 0 to 14 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the solum, and from slightly acid to strongly acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon that is up to 4 inches thick. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present,  is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Structure is fine or medium granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Structure is fine or medium granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chroma of 2 is related to the color of the parent material and is not indicative of wetness.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to coarse sand.  It is massive or single grain, and the consistence is very friable or loose."

Classification is updated to Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Typic Haplorthods with this revision. The former classification was Coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods.  3. The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (O and E horizons).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 5 inches (Bhs horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
