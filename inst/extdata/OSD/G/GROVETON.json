  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface and upper part of the subsoil and from 0 to 14 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the solum, and from slightly acid to strongly acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon that is up to 4 inches thick. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present,  is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Structure is fine or medium granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Structure is fine or medium granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chroma of 2 is related to the color of the parent material and is not indicative of wetness.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to coarse sand.  It is massive or single grain, and the consistence is very friable or loose."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berkshire, Houghtonville, Rawsonville and Tunbridge series.  Berkshire soils have more rock fragments in the control section and formed in loamy till.  Houghtonville soils have Bhs and/or Bh horizons that are more than 4 inches thick.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Groveton soils are on terraces adjacent to flood plains and on glaciolacustrine landforms dominated by micaceous and siliceous materials with variable amounts of phyllites.  Slope is dominantly 0 to 15 percent, but ranges to 60 percent on escarpments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean growing season ranges from 90 to 110 days."

Colton soils are sandy-skeletal.  Croghan, Madawaska, and Nicholville soils are moderately well drained and are in lower positions on the landscape.  Croghan soils are sandy, Madawaska soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal and Nicholville soils are coarse-silty.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. The type location is moved from Grafton County NH to Coos County NH to better reflect the classification of the series as spodosols.  2.  Classification is updated to Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Typic Haplorthods with this revision. The former classification was Coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods.  3. The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (O and E horizons).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 5 inches (Bhs horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
