Content of coarse fragments ranges from none to 5 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon ranges from very dark grayish brown to very dark brown.\nThe E horizon ranges from dark grayish brown to dark brown, is continuous above the A&B horizon, and tongues deeply into the B/E horizon.\nThe Bt portion of the E/B and B/E horizons is dark yellowish brown, dark brown, brown or yellowish brown and is dominantly silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and has less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The solum is moderately acid or strongly acid."

The moisture regime of these soils is xeric.  Soil Taxonomy has no provision for Glossxeralfs.  These soils should be considered as Aquic Palexeralfs."
