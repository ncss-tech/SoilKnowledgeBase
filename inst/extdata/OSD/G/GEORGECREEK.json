  "OVERVIEW": "The Georgecreek series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from granitic rock with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on broad ridges and hillslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Xeric soil moisture regime.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 60 inches.   Depth to weathered granitic bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand, and 0 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3, dry or moist.  The lower part has 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam and has 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons lack a BA horizon and have an E or B/E horizon 6 to 14 inches thick, that has texture and reaction like the BA horizon and hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5, dry or moist.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6, dry or moist.  It is commonly loam, or clay loam, and less commonly sandy clay loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid, neutral, or mildly alkaline.  There are few to common thin clay films on ped faces and lining pores.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6, dry or moist.  It is loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 5 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 2 percent cobbles.  Reaction is commonly neutral but ranges to mildly alkaline.  Some pedons lack a BC horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon 6 to 20 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist.  It is loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 5 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 3 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."
