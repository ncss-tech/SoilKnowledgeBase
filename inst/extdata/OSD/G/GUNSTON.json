In some pedons this horizon does not have a dominant matrix color but has redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or red are common to many.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 60 percent and silt content is more than 30 percent.  The Bt and Btg horizons are clay, clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon colors are similar to the Btg horizon.  It is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, in addition to the colors of the Btg and BCg horizons, may have hue of 5Y, with value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2, or it is neutral, with value of 5 to 7.  It is stratified sandy, loamy, or clayey sediment."
