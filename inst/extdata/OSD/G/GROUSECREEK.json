  "OVERVIEW": "The Grousecreek series consists of deep, well-drained soils on forested mountain slopes.  They formed in material weathered from intermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 20 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
