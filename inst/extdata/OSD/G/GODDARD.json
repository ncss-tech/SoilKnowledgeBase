  "OVERVIEW": "The Goddard series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon (excluding the surface Mt. St. Helens 'T' ash layer) has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, ashy sandy loam or ashy fine sandy loam with 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Moist chroma is 4 when moist value is 3.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, ashy fine sandy loam, or ashy sandy loam and may be gravelly. It is 5 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2C1 horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loamy sand and is gravelly, cobbly or very gravelly.  It is 15 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  This horizon has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons, is designated a 2BC horizon, and is part of the cambic horizon.\nThe 2C2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  Coarse sands are multicolored.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand and is very gravelly or extremely gravelly.  It is 30 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goddard soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments with slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in glacial outwash from mixed sources with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 5,100 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist summers.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 39-44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 130 days."

Nevine soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills and mountains.  Parmenter soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have a volcanic ash mantle 14 to 25 inches thick, and are on kames, kame terraces and outwash terraces.  Scrabblers soils are sandy and have a volcanic ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick.  Torboy soils are sandy and do not have a volcanic ash mantle.  Scrabblers and Torboy soils are on similar landscapes as the Goddard soils.  Wapal soils are sandy-skeletal, do not have a volcanic ash mantle, and are on eskers, terraces and terrace escarpments."
