  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 33 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide and several feet long extend downward into the upper Bt horizon.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 31 inches and includes all or part of the Bt horizon.  The depth to the underlying till ranges from 18 to 32 inches.  The till has 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of which about 20 to 30 percent are shale.  Most pedons redoximorphic features below a depth of 30 inches.  The particle-size control section commonly is 35 to 45 percent clay, but has up to 50 percent clay in the upper Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It typically is silty clay loam, but the range includes silt loam and clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Tongues or coatings are along vertical ped faces.   The Bt horizon is silty clay or clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value 3 or 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Tongues or coatings are along vertical faces of peds.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2Bky horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam or clay loam and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  They have common or many masses of carbonates. The Bky horizon has few to many nests of gypsum.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline.  Carbonates are disseminated or in few to common masses.  It has nests of gypsum in some pedons.  It has few to many redoximorphic features."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burnel, Harmony, Laplatta and Sieche series.  Burnel soils have thinner A horizons and formed in alluvium.  Harmony soils are free of rock fragments throughout and formed entirely in glaciolacustrine sediments.  Laplatta soils have drier summers and formed in residuum from tuff, conglomerate, sandstone or limestone.  Sieche soils have distinct coatings of clean silt and sand grains on faces of peds in the lower A and upper Bt horizons and are on slopes of more than 9 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients typically are less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  Gwinner soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments over loamy till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 18 to 22 inches."

Aastad, Kranzburg, Lismore and Svea soils are on similar positions and do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Aastad and Svea soils are fine-loamy and Kranzburg and Lismore soils are fine-silty.  Barnes, Forman and Peever soils are on higher positions and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick.  In addition, Barnes and Forman soils are fine-loamy.  Hamerly soils are adjacent to depressions, have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches and are somewhat poorly drained.  Parnell and Tonka soils are in depressions and are very poorly and poorly drained, respectively."
