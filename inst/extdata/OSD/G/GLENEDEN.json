  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated during the winter season.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. Soil depth is greater than 60 inches, but the rooting depth is limited by a seasonal water table.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The control section is silty clay and clay with an average of 40 to 55 percent clay.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 and 6 dry, and chroma of 3 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with an estimated clay content of 40 to 50 percent.  Strongly weathered siltstone rock fragments may range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe BCg horizon or BC horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay with 50 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Cg horizon or C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.  Strongly weathered siltstone fragments may range from 0 to 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gleneden soils are on level to strongly sloping dissected marine terraces that merge into the foothills of the Coast Range.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The Gleneden soils formed in clayey marine sediments with an influence of down-slope erosion materials.  They are at elevations from 25 to 100 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches. The mean January temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 58 to 60 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."

Blacklock and Depoe soils have a spodic horizon and are poorly drained.  Lint soils are medial and lack redox features.  Nelscott soils have a spodic horizon and are moderately well drained."
