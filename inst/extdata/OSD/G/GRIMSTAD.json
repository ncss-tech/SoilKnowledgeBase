  "STATES": "MN,ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grimstad series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a dominantly sandy mantle of glacial lacustrine or outwash sediments over loamy glacial till or silty glacial lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and moraines.  Permeability is moderate to rapid in the upper part and moderate in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick. The top of the calcic horizon is within 16 inches of the surface.  The top of the 2C horizon is between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Free carbonates are in all parts.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The 2C horizon contains 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Most horizons above the 2C horizon do not have rock fragments, however, a thin pebble band is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  It is ranges from slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.  Some pedons have an ABk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand; but in some pedons the upper part is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.   Gypsum crystals are in this horizon in some pedons.  The Bk horizon is strongly or violently effervescent. The calcic horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly has redoximorphic features in most parts, but distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are not present above a depth of 20 inches.  It is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent.  The texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4; but in some pedons the upper part of it has 10YR hue, with value and chroma ranging up to 6.  It commonly has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It is slightly or strongly effervescent and contains an equivalent of 15 to 35 percent of calcium carbonate."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grimstad soils are in glacial lake plains and deltas on glacial moraines.  Generally, they are on broad flats, but some are on long, narrow and irregularly shaped low rises that are 0 to 3 percent.  Grimstad soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of sandy calcareous glaciolacustrine or outwash sediments over loamy calcareous till or silty lacustrine sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation from 16 to 23 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1300 feet."
