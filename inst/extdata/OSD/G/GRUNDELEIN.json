Bowes soils do not have a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained Dunham soils are on lower positions on the landform. Dunham and Waupecan soils form a drainage sequence with Grundelein soils. Millstream soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions nearby."

An intermittent apparent high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and very high (greater than 141.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material."
