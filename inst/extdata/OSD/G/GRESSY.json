    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gressy soils are on ridgetops. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in silty and gravelly slope alluvium and the underlying loamy and clayey colluvium and residuum. Elevations are commonly 700 to 1,200 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 45 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Alred, Gatewood, Mano, Ocie and Viraton soils. Alred, Mano and Ocie soils have a loamy-skeletal over clayey particle-size class and are on side slopes. Gatewood soils are moderately deep to dolomite bedrock and are on side slopes. Viraton soils have a fragipan and are adjacent to Gressy soils on the same ridge top positions."
