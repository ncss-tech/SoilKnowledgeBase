  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 37 through 76 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 5 through 30 percent in the surface, from 15 through 35 percent in the upper part of the Bw horizon, and from 20 through 45 percent in the lower part of the Bw and in the C horizon. Total rock fragment content ranges from 5 through 40 percent in the surface, from 15 through 50 percent in the upper part of the Bw horizon and from 35 through 70 percent in the lower part of the Bw and in the C horizon. Below the particle-size control section the total rock fragment content ranges from 10 through 70 percent in the C horizon. Reaction of the A horizon ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid, unless limed. Reaction of the Bw and C horizons ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have a thin AE or light colored E horizon underlain by thin, dark reddish brown Bhs or Bs horizons that are less than 1 inch thick. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the upper part, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The Bw1 horizon terminates between depths of 10 through 15 inches. The Bw2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction, and silt content is less than 25 percent.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brandywine and Hoosic series. Brandywine soils are from outside of Region R. They formed in residuum from gneiss and do not have stone and boulder erratics. Hoosic soils have water sorted gravel and are stratified throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gloucester soils are on till upland hills and ridges. Slope gradients range from 0 through more than 50 percent. The till regolith is stony or bouldery, sandy ground moraine derived principally from granite and gneiss rocks. The mean annual air temperature is 7 through 10 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is 889 through 1270 millimeters. Average frost-free period ranges from 180 days in southern and coastal New England to 120 days in the interior."
