  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Siliceous pebbles and cobbles range from 60 to 90 percent by volume in the Ap horizon, from 35 to 70 percent in the upper B2t horizons and from about 15 to 50 percent in the B3 and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/4), light reddish brown\n(5YR 6/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 8/4).  It is very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  Reaction is medium\nacid through very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizons are wxite (10YR 8/1, 8/2) or light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2) and have mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Some pedons are promnently and coarsely mottled with these colors.  The\nBt horizons contain 0 to 5 percent, by volume, plinthite.  The\nupper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is gravelly sandy clay loam or\nvery gravelly sandy clay loam with clay content of 20 to about 35 percent.  The Bt horizons are strongly acid through extremely\nacid.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to 65 percent by sum of cations.\nThe g3&C horizons are white mottled with red, yellow, and gray or\na mottled matrix of these colors.  Some pedons have weak bedding p+anes with thin strata of weakly cemented sandstone."

Delfina soils have more than 75 percent base saturation, mixed mineralogy, mean annual soil temperature of m**e than 72 degrees F., and less than 35 percent coarse fragments in\nthe B2t horizons.  Ellen soils have sandy A horizons more than 20 inches thick.  Hornsby soils have mixed mineralogy.  Nocken soils lack low chroma mottles, have mixed mineralogy, and have c+q*ey control sections.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in ancient stream terrace or delta deposits of sand and gravel, mainly associated with Citronelle geology.  The areas have been\ndesurfaced or mined for coarse fragments.  Mean annual temperature\nis 70 degrees to 72 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 32\nto 43 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 42 to 64.\n(GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Ellen series and the Silvern and Tremona series.  Silvern soils have\nsady A horizons 40 to 80 inches thick.  Tremona soils have sandy A horizons thicker than 20 inches and more than 35 percent clay yn\nthe B2t horizons."
