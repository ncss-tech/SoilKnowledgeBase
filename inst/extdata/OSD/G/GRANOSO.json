Azulugar (MLRA 42) soils are on fan remnants on a sand plain at elevations of 914 to 1219 meters (3,000 to 4,000 feet); most of the rainfall occurs as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn, and does not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation. Bigcanyon (MLRA 30) soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, are found on mountains and formed in colluviums and residuum weathered from granitoid or gneiss with slopes from 30 to 75 percent. Birdcanyon (MLRA 29) soils are intermittingly moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms, are on fan aprons, formed in alluvium derived from granite with slopes from 4 to 15 percent, and have elevations of 1160 to 1465 meters (3,805 to 4,806 feet). Bluepoint (MLRA 30) soils are on dunes and sand sheets and formed in eolian materials derived from mixed rock sources. Brazito (MLRA 40, 41, and 42) soils have most of the rainfall occuring as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn and do not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation. Cajon (MLRA 30) soils receive precipitation during the summer months due to convection storms, are on recent fans, fan skirts, fan aprons, inset fans, and river terraces, and are derived from dominantly granitic rocks. Copia (MLRA 42) soils are on dunes and shrub-coppice dunes and elevations are 1189 to 1280 meters (3,900 to 4,200 feet); most of the rainfall occurs as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn, and does not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation. Hembrillo (MLRA 42) soils are on dunes and formed from sandy gypsiferous eloian deposits with elevations ranging from 1,200 to 1,210 meters (3,940 to 3,970 feet); most of the rainfall occurs as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn, and it does not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation. Jawbone (MLRA 30) soils are shallow to a paralithic contact, on mountainous side slopes and ridges with slopes from 8 to 75 percent; elevations are 730 to 1,340 meters (2,395 to 4,396), and they are formed from weathered granitic rocks. Kajoe (MLRA 30) soils are on inset fans and footslopes of erosional fan remnants and formed in sandy granitic alluvium; elevations are 565 to 870 meters (1,860 to 2.860 feet) and mean annual soil temperature is 20 to 21 degrees C. (68 to 70 degrees F.). Koehn (MLRA 30) soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, stream terraces, and drainageways with elevations from 680 to 1,160 meters (2,230 to 3,805 feet), and formed in granitic alluvium; the soil moisture control section is usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittingly moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms. Maynard Lake (MLRA 30) soils are deep, contain more than 20 percent volcanic ash or pumice and are calcareous, and have a mean annual soil temperature from 15 to 17 degrees C. (59 to 62 degrees F.). Moapa (MLRA 30) soils are moderately deep, are on sand sheets over rock pediments, and formed in eolian sands over sandstone. Morongo (MLRA 30) soils are on fan aprons, inset fans, fan remnants and in drainageways, and formed in alluvium derived from granitoid and/or gneissic rock; elevations range from 650 to 1,550 meters (2,135 to 5,085 feet); the soil moisture control section is usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September following summer convection storms. Pintura soils formed in deposits of wind-blown sand weathered from sandstone, have a hue of 5YR or redder and lack stratification. Toquop soils typically have hue redder than 10YR and are at elevations of 425 to 1,220 meters (1,400 to 4,000 feet). University (MLRA 42) soils are at elevations that range from 1,065 to 1,370 meters (3,500 to 4,500 feet); most of the rainfall occurs as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn, and does not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation. Yander (MLRA 30) soils are deep to a paralithic contact and are on fan aprons over pediment with elevations from 900 to 1,310 meters (2,950 to 4,295 feet). Yturbide (MLRA 40, 41, and 42) soils have hues of 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR in the C horizons and are at elevations of 885 to 1,830 meters (2,900 to 6,000 feet); most of the rainfall occurs as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn, and does not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation."

Granoso soils formed in alluvium composed of mixed rock sources. The climate is arid with hot dry summers and somewhat moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 127 to 203 millimeters (5 to 8 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 17 to 18 degrees C. (62 to 65 degrees F.). The difference between summer and mean winter temperatures is less than 4 degrees C. (40 degrees F.). The soil temperature is always above 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.). The soil between the depths of 10 and 30 centimeters (4 and 12 inches) is dry in all parts from April 1 until January 1 and is moist in some or all parts for only 60 to 90 consecutive days from January through March. Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days. Frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days."
