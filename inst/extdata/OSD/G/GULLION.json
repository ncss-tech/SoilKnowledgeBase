It is loam or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. High and low chroma mottles are present in some pedons. Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are restricted to depths greater than 16 inches.

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Gladehill, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils are well drained and are on similar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils are well drained, contain more clay in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Irongate soils contain more sand in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces. Newmarc soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar landscapes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now within the range of the Gullion series were previously correlated as Lindside and Lobdell series in published soil surveys.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1. Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 inches (Ap and BA horizon). 2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 23 to 42 inches (Bw horizon). 3. Fluventic features - irregular decrease in organic matter content with increasing depth. 4. Udic moisture regime.\nSIR = VA0286\nMLRA = 128, 147\nREVISED = 12/2005 JWB and MDJ\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class is based on the classification of similar and geographically associated soils. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision DDR-DAG-WJE"
