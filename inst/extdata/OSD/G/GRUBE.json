Dacore soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have mainly igneous gravel, and have calcic horizon at depths of 20 to 48 cm from the soil surface.  Derapter soils are deep to lithic contacts and do not have calcic horizons.  Majuba soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Satt soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
