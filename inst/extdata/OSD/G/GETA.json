  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Geta soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, stream terraces,  and fan skirts.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from predominantly volcanic rocks with minor influence from limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot, intermittently moist summers and cool winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 190 to 210 days."
