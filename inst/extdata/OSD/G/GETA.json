  "OVERVIEW": "The Geta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from predominantly volcanic rocks with some influence from limestone.  The Geta soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, stream terraces, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",
