Slopes are 3 to 45 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 50 inches (711 to 1270 mm) and the frost-free period is about 50 to 120 days."

Carlinton soils are on south and west-facing hills and have xeric moisture regimes. Cavendish soils are on south and west-facing hills at lower elevations and are fine-loamy. Wilkins soils are on flood plains and are somewhat poorly drained. Kauder and Reggear soils are on undulating plateaus and have fragipans."
