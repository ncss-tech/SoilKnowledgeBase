The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 25 percent clay and 50 to 85 percent rock fragments.  The solum has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and has 4 to 8 kilograms of organic carbon per square meter of soil to a depth of one meter.   Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is very gravelly loam  with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 25 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 6 moist and dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is a very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles."

The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."

Bosland, Dulandy, and Zwagg soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.   Floras and Wedderburn soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This classification was updated in March of 2013 using the Eleventh edition of Soil Taxonomy.  This series was formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, isomesic Lithic Dystropepts.  Competing series were not checked at this time.\nMinerology changed from mixed to isotic 1/2000, competing series not updated at that time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 9 inches. (A, Bw1 horizons)\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 9 to 16 inches. (Bw2 horizon)\nLithic feature - lithic bedrock at 16 inches (2R horizon)\nParticle-size control section - from 10 to 16 inches.
