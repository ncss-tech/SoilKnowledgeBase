Slopes range from 25 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from basalt or other bedrock, but the upper parts may have some loessal material.  The climate has dry summers, a mean annual precipitation of 12 to 17 inches, including 3 to 7 feet of snowfall.  The frost-free season is 105 to 130 days.  Average annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F."
