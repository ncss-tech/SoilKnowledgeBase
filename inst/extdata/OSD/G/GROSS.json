  "OVERVIEW": "The Gross series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt or other bedrock.  Gross soils are on north facing slopes of hills or mountains.  Slopes are 25 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
