  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodnight series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy eolian sediments of Holocene age. These soils occur on reworked, stabilized dunes adjacent to flood plains of major streams, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 860 mm (34 in).",
