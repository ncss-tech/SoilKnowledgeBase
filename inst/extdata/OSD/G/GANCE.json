    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gance soils are on summits and side slopes of fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is cool and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm and comes mostly in the form of snow; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost free season is 100 to 120 days."
