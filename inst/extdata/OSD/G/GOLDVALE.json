  "REVDATE": "05/2023",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Goldvale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvial fan sediments derived from reddish brown arkosic sandstone and interbedded sandstone and shale. Goldvale soils are on side slopes of alluvial valleys, mountains, hogbacks and homoclinal ridges. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
