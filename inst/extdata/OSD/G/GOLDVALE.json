  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Goldvale soils have albic horizons, and transitional E/B or B/E horizons.  Typically, they have Oi, Oe, and A horizons but these are absent in some pedons.  These soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches and are noncalcareous in at least the upper 3 inches of the C horizon.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the particle size control section and are mostly reddish brown flagstones or stones.  The sand fraction contains large amounts of medium and coarse angular granite sand.  Packing patterns of sand grains within the matrix tend to be cubical, with a high proportion of flat bearing surfaces between grains.  Depth to the base of the solum is more than 55 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees and mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy clay or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt and 20 to 55 percent sand with a high proportion of medium and coarse sand.  Some pedons have stony modifiers.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon when present, has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is coarse sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Campspass, Citadel, Fortwingate, Kelvin, Larkson, McVickers, Osoridge, Pylon, and Zuna series.  Fortwingate and Osoridge soils have either a lithic or a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Citadel soils have thinner solums and carbonates above 40 inches.  Larkson soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, and have C horizons with more than 18 percent clay.  Zuni soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, thinner albic horizons, more than 18 percent clay in the C horizon and lack significant amounts of medium and coarse angular granite sand.  Pylon soils have solums less than 30 inches thick and have segregated lime in lower solum and upper C horizons.  Pylon soils also have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Campspass and Kelvin soils have segregated lime in lower solum and upper C horizons.  McVickers soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldvale soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes are typically 3 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial fan sediments derived principally from reddish brown arkosic sandstone and interbedded sandstone and shale.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer.   Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual summer temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F."
