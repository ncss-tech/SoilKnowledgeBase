Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches, and extends into the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.  Rock fragment content averages less than 5 percent by volume throughout the series control section.  In the particle-size control section, clay content averages 27 to 35 percent and average sand content coarser than very fine is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons contains carbonates below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and A) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the A horizon in some pedons has distinct or prominent redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation in the matrix.  Texture is silty clay loam, and less commonly silt loam or silty clay.  Clay content averages 27 to 35 percent, but ranges from 20 to 42 percent clay, and sand content coarser than very fine is less than 15 percent.\nThe second part of the series control section (Btg or Bg horizons that formed in silty alluvium) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 2.

These soils formed in silty or loamy alluvium at least 40 inches thick.  Below a depth of 40 inches the alluvium increases in sand content and decreases in clay content.  These soils typically are subject to frequent flooding, but some areas are rare or occasional because of levees, locks and dams, or other flood-control structures.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Gorham soils were originally described as having 40 to 44 inches of \"clayey\" material over sandy sediments in Jackson County, Illinois.  Later, they were described as having 26 to 40 inches of \"clayey\" material over sandy sediments.\nThe typical pedon was sampled and described from the same map unit as the previous typical pedon for this revision.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:  Mollic epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and A horizons).  Cambic horizon - from a depth of approximately 14 inches to 62 inches (Btg1, Btg2, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2BC horizons).  Aquic conditions - endosaturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Mechanical data on file - Numbers C72IL-39-1-1 to 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
