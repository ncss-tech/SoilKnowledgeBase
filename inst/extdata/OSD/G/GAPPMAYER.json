Organic matter decreases regularly or reaches levels of less than 0.5 percent within 50 inches. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days during the summers. The mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F., average summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. The soils are medium acid to neutral. The Al horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 1 through 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is cobbly sandy loam to very cobbly light loam with 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments, typically cobbles. The Bl horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is absent in some pedons. The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It ranges from very cobbly sandy clay loam to very cobbly loam with more than 18 to 27 percent clay, and with 50 to 80 percent coarse fragments, mainly cobbles. The B3 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very cobbly light loam to very cobbly loamy fine sand, with 50 to 80 percent cobbles."

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks, mainly sandstone and shale. The climate is moist subhumid, having a mean annual temperature of less than 47 degrees F., average summer temperature of 60 to 65 degrees F., and average annual precipitation of 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free period is about 80 to 90 days."

Bradshaw soils have weak B2 horizons and lack A2 horizons. Wallsburg soils are fine textured and have a lithic contact within 20 inches."
