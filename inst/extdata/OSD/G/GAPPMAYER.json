    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 30 to 50 inches thick to the bottom of the B2t horizons. The mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick. Organic matter decreases regularly or reaches levels of less than 0.5 percent within 50 inches. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days during the summers. The mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F., average summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. The soils are medium acid to neutral. The Al horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 1 through 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is cobbly sandy loam to very cobbly light loam with 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments, typically cobbles. The Bl horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is absent in some pedons. The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It ranges from very cobbly sandy clay loam to very cobbly loam with more than 18 to 27 percent clay, and with 50 to 80 percent coarse fragments, mainly cobbles. The B3 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very cobbly light loam to very cobbly loamy fine sand, with 50 to 80 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gappmayer soils are at elevations of 5,500 to 7,200 feet on sloping to very steep northerly facing mountain slopes with gradients of 5 to 70 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks, mainly sandstone and shale. The climate is moist subhumid, having a mean annual temperature of less than 47 degrees F., average summer temperature of 60 to 65 degrees F., and average annual precipitation of 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free period is about 80 to 90 days."

Broadhead and Henefer soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon, lack A2 horizons, and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the profile. Bradshaw soils have weak B2 horizons and lack A2 horizons. Wallsburg soils are fine textured and have a lithic contact within 20 inches."
