  "OVERVIEW": "The Gazwell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained mineral soils with a buried organic soil. They formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources underlain by decomposed hydrophytic plant remains. They are in backswamps along the edge of fresh water marshes. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation is 33 to 43 centimeters (13 to 17 inches). Average January temperature is 8 degrees C (46 degrees F), average July temperature is 24 degrees C (75 degrees F) and the average annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

These soils are artificially drained, runoff is very slow, permeability is moderate in the mineral soil and rapid in the underlying organic soil. The water table is maintained by pumping at a depth of 46 to 152 centimeters (18 to 60 inches). Depth to water table is 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36) inches in winter and early spring months. These soils subside. These soils are protected by levees and have a rare hazard of flooding."
