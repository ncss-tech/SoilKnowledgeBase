  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gazwell soils are in backswamps along the edge of fresh water marshes. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources underlain by decomposed hydrophytic plant remains. The plant remains consist of reeds and tules. Elevations are 4.5 meters (15 feet) below sea level to sea level. The climate is dry subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 33 to 43 centimeters (13 to 17 inches). Average January temperature is 8 degrees C (46 degrees F), average July temperature is 24 degrees C (75 degrees F) and the average annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). Frost-free season is 275 to 300 days."

Rindge soils have continuous sapric organic material to a depth of 130 centimeters (51 inches) or more and are in sloughs and drainage channels.  Sailboat and Scribner soils have a fine-loamy textural control section. Sailboat soils are on natural levees. Scribner soils are on edges of backswamps."

These soils are artificially drained, runoff is very slow, permeability is moderate in the mineral soil and rapid in the underlying organic soil. The water table is maintained by pumping at a depth of 46 to 152 centimeters (18 to 60 inches). Depth to water table is 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36) inches in winter and early spring months. These soils subside. These soils are protected by levees and have a rare hazard of flooding."
