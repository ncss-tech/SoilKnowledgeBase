  "OVERVIEW": "The Gutport series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic deposits 9 to 15 inches thick over clayey deposits underlain by limestone bedrock on lake plains.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and slow in the clayey material. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
