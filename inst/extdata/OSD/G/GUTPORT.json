Chippeny soils have 16 or more inches of organic material over bedrock and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Ensign and poorly drained Ruse soils formed in loamy material 10 to 20 inches thick over bedrock.  Ensign soils are on slightly higher landscape positions, and the Ruse soils are on similar landscape positions."
