These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between the depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 50 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 38 inches thick and includes part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly silty clay, very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam.  The Btk is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  A thin Bk horizon is in some pedons just above the basalt."
