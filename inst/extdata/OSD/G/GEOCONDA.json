    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to lime is 20 to 38 inches.   Depth to a lithic contact is more than 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 50 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between the depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 50 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 38 inches thick and includes part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly silty clay, very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam.  The Btk is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  A thin Bk horizon is in some pedons just above the basalt."
