The control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam averaging between 10 to 18 percent clay.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent; up to 10 percent cobblestones are found in the very lower part of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  A Bw horizon is lacking in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Goslin soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Querida soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Sham soils have a control section that is stratified and have a weighted average texture of loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Tebbs soils are formed in mainly basalt sediments and have layers of loamy sand textures in the control section."

They formed in locally transported calcareous materials weathered from sandstone or sandstone interbedded with shale.  Elevation is 5800 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches, which occurs mainly in the winter and spring.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 58 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 100 days."
