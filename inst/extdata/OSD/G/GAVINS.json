  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to siltstone is 10 to 20 inches.  In some pedons, the upper 10 inches is a thin mantle of glacial till or local alluvium.  Siltstone fragments are in all parts of the solum.  Small igneous rocks are in the upper part of some pedons.  The control section typically is silt loam or silty clay loam but in some pedons it is loam that averages from 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  The profile ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe AC horizon is 10YR or 2.5Y hue, values of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 80 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist; and chroma of 1 to 5.  Few or common accumulations of gypsum are in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 50 to 90 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is soft siltstone and is easily penetrated but becomes hard when exposed to air.  Seams of gypsum ranging from 1/4 to as much as 3/4 inch in thickness occur between fracture planes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gavins soils are undulating to steep or convex ridges bordering deeply entrenched streams and larger drainages.  Slope gradients range from 6 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in sediments weathered from soft siltstone high in carbonates.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 25 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Betts, Redstoe, and Sansarc soils.  Betts soils do not have paralithic bedrock within 40 inches and Sansarc soils have a fine textured control section.  They are on similar landscapes.  Redstoe soils are 20 to 40 inches to siltstone, have mollic epipedons, and are on less sloping landscapes."
