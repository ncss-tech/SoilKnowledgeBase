    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on flood plains and in upland swales and drainageways, and alluvial flats.  Slopes typically range from 0 to 3 percent and are usually concave.  The soils formed in calcareous alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches, and ranges from 10 to 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  Average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is about 57 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to greater than 60 inches.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (part of Bg horizon)\nOchric epipedon:  from 0 to 8 inches.  (Ag horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 60 inches.  (Bg horizon)\nEndosaturation and aquic conditions:  throughout the pedon (Ag, Bg horizons)\nFluvaquentic feature:  inferred from the flood plain geomorphic position and the assumption that organic carbon content is higher than 0.2 percent at 50 inches. Stratification is not identified in the pedon, but it is assumed that a newer more detailed description may identify some stratification.\nThe 06/2009 revision changes the classification from Typic Cryaquepts to Fluvaquentic Cryaquepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
