The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts for 30 consecutive days immediately following May 1.  It is dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days immediately following July 1.  The soil is usually calcareous to the surface, but may be noncalcareous in the upper few inches in some pedons. Depth to the 2C horizon is 15 to 30 inches.  The particle- size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, or very gravelly sand.  Content of rock fragments is 45 to 75 percent.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sand or sand.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent."
