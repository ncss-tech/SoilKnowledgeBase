  "OVERVIEW": "The Gravier series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and welded tuff. Gravier soils are on fan skirts, summits of fan remnants, and beach plains. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
