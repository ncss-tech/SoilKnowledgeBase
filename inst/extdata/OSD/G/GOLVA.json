  "OVERVIEW": "The Golva series consists of very deep and deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on fans and terraces, and in shallow concave swales.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",

Amsterdam soils contain substantial amounts of volcanic glass shards and are in intermountain valleys.  Bryant soils formed in reworked glaciolacustrine sediments or loess and commonly have rock fragments throughout.  Omio, Peritsa and Sen soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Peritsa soils have hues of 5YR or redder throughout.  Temvik soils have glacial till 2C horizons."

The soils are formed in silty alluvium derived from local sedimentary beds.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the moisture falls during spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 120 to 135 days and elevation ranges from 1650 to 3600 feet"
