The control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent clay.  The depth to siltstone or silty shale is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is silt loam, but includes loam and silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons the Bw1 horizon contains carbonates.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsterdam, Bryant, Omio, Peritsa, Sen and Temvik series.  Amsterdam soils contain substantial amounts of volcanic glass shards and are in intermountain valleys.  Bryant soils formed in reworked glaciolacustrine sediments or loess and commonly have rock fragments throughout.  Omio, Peritsa and Sen soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Peritsa soils have hues of 5YR or redder throughout.  Temvik soils have glacial till 2C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Golva soils are on fans and terraces, and in shallow concave swales.  Slope gradients commonly average between 2 and 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils are formed in silty alluvium derived from local sedimentary beds.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the moisture falls during spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 120 to 135 days and elevation ranges from 1650 to 3600 feet"

Chama soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock.  Cabba soils on steep slopes and ridge crests.  They do not have a mollic epipedon and are shallow to soft bedrock."
