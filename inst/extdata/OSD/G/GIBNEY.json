The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature varies from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 and 21 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Hard iron nodule content ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/4, 7/2, 7/4; 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2, 6/4; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  The horizon may be smeary and may be brittle when moist.  Clay content ranges from 7 to 15 percent.  Subrounded nodules (2-30mm) range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 5Y 7/2,; 2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3 or N 7/0.  Moist colors are 5Y 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8 or N 5/0.  Mottle colors are 2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 6/6, 7/1, 8/1; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8 or 2.5YR 4/8.  Moist mottle colors are 2.5Y 6/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/8, 7/2, 8/1; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 4/6; 2.5YR 4/6 or 4/8.  Low chroma grayish colors occur with higher chroma brownish colors and reddish colors in a regularly occurring reticulate pattern.  This pattern occurs within a depth of 30 to 50 inches.  It is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The horizon contains 0 to 20 percent soft plinthite.  Hard iron nodules are commonly 2 to 30mm in diameter but may range to 200mm in the lowest part of the horizon.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  Clay mineralogy is dominated by 1 to 1 lattice clays.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid."
