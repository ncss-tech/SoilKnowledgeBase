  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 80 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature varies from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 and 21 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Hard iron nodule content ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/4, 7/2, 7/4; 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2, 6/4; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  The horizon may be smeary and may be brittle when moist.  Clay content ranges from 7 to 15 percent.  Subrounded nodules (2-30mm) range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 5Y 7/2,; 2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3 or N 7/0.  Moist colors are 5Y 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8 or N 5/0.  Mottle colors are 2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 6/6, 7/1, 8/1; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8 or 2.5YR 4/8.  Moist mottle colors are 2.5Y 6/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/8, 7/2, 8/1; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 4/6; 2.5YR 4/6 or 4/8.  Low chroma grayish colors occur with higher chroma brownish colors and reddish colors in a regularly occurring reticulate pattern.  This pattern occurs within a depth of 30 to 50 inches.  It is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The horizon contains 0 to 20 percent soft plinthite.  Hard iron nodules are commonly 2 to 30mm in diameter but may range to 200mm in the lowest part of the horizon.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  Clay mineralogy is dominated by 1 to 1 lattice clays.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gibney soils occur on marine terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 200 to 750 feet.  The soils formed in marine sediments.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days."

Aborigine and Blacklock soils support extreme pygmy vegetation.  Aborigine soils are saturated with water above 10 inches for extended periods during the winter and are very poorly drained.  Blacklock soils are shallow to an iron cemented hardpan.   Shinglemill soils have low chroma mottles between 10 and 30 inches and are poorly drained."

The saturated zone starts between the depths of 30 and 50 inches and extends to greater than 60 inches.  The soil is not saturated above 60 inches from summer through early fall. Surface runoff under bare soil conditions is slow or medium; slow permeability."
