  "REVDATE": "05/2009",
  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grinter series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on back slopes and shoulders of uplands. Slope ranges from 3 to 10 percent. These soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian material. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters.",

(E and Bt1 and E and Bt2 horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: In the zone from 192 centimeters to 210 centimeters (2C3 horizon).\nTop two horizons meet mollic colors; however, it lacks the organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.\nThis soil was formerly included with the Thurman series. The Thurman series has an ustic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData for the OSD typical pedon is from National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 07KS045015.\nAdditional laboratory data- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 94KS177001.
