(E and Bt1 and E and Bt2 horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: In the zone from 192 centimeters to 210 centimeters (2C3 horizon).\nTop two horizons meet mollic colors; however, it lacks the organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.\nThis soil was formerly included with the Thurman series. The Thurman series has an ustic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData for the OSD typical pedon is from National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 07KS045015.\nAdditional laboratory data- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 94KS177001.
