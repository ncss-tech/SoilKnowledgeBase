  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grayford soils are typically on shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains and sinkholes. Slope gradient is dominantly 6 to 25 percent, and ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Grayford soils formed in less than 56 cm (22 inches) of loess and in the underlying till of Illinoian age and residuum from limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 122 to 259 meters (400 to 850 feet) above mean sea level."

The very deep Ryker and Stinesville soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains and sinkholes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification of this series is borderline between fine-loamy and fine-silty. The typical pedon averages about 14.6 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. Also data from Owen County, IN (S92IN119-26) places this series in the Typic rather than Ultic subgroup of Hapludalfs. Therefore the classification of this series could change as more data is collected.\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 153531 and 153538.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 15 cm (6 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 15 to 132 cm (6 to 52 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 3Bt5 horizons).\nLithic contact: at 132 cm (52 inches) (top of the 3R layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University Soils Laboratory pedon number S77IN77-2.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
