  "OVERVIEW": "The Grayford series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in less than 56 cm (22 inches) of loess and in the underlying till of Illinoian age and residuum from limestone. They are on dissected till plains and sinkholes. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification of this series is borderline between fine-loamy and fine-silty. The typical pedon averages about 14.6 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. Also data from Owen County, IN (S92IN119-26) places this series in the Typic rather than Ultic subgroup of Hapludalfs. Therefore the classification of this series could change as more data is collected.\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 153531 and 153538.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 15 cm (6 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 15 to 132 cm (6 to 52 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 3Bt5 horizons).\nLithic contact: at 132 cm (52 inches) (top of the 3R layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University Soils Laboratory pedon number S77IN77-2.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
