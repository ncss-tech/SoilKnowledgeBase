  "OVERVIEW": "The Gerbana series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated shale and mudstone. These soils are on sedimentary plains. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
