Nonweatherable minerals in the sand fraction are 95 percent or more.  Average absolute moisture deficit is 2 or more.  Days dry are less than 90 (cumulative).\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand and is slightly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand and ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe C2 and C3 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  In most pedons, they have stains in shades of brown, red, or yellow.  The C2 and C3 horizons are loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand and range from slightly acid to very strongly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alaga, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Darden, Foxworth, Lakeland, McNeely, Tonkawa, Turkey, and Wando series in the same family.  All of the series in the same family except Bigbee, Lakeland and Wando have a mean annual temperature of 64 degrees F. or more.  Cainhoy, Darden, McNeely, Turkey and Tonkawa contain Bw horizons.  In addition, Bigbee, Foxworth and Wando soils contain water tables for 1 to 3 months each year.  Darden and Tonkawa soils are dry for 75 to 90 and 125 to 150 days each year, respectively.  Wando soils are well drained, developed in marine sediments on marine terraces at 5 to 25 feet elevation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in material weathered from sandy sediments.  Slopes are generally 3 to 5 percent but range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index is more than 64."
