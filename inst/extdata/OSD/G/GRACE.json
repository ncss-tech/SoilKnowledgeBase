  "OVERVIEW": "The Grace series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified loamy glaciofluvial deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
