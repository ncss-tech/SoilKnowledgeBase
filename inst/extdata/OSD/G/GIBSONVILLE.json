  "OVERVIEW": "The Gibsonville series consists of shallow well drained soils that formed in material weathered from andesitic tuff.  These soils are on ridgetops and steep uplands and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 80 inches and mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 12 to 20 inches.  Gravel, cobbles and stones vary from 15 to 60 percent throughout the profile but average more than 35 percent in the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. The soil from 7 inches to the paralithic contact becomes moist in November or early December and remains moist until May.  The soil is slightly acid or medium acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4 dry and 2 moist.  It is a gravelly or cobbly loam or sandy loam, averaging 10 to 15 percent clay.  15 to 35 percent gravel or cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, 5 or 6 dry and 2, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6 dry and 2 or 4 moist.  It is very cobbly, cobbly or extremely cobbly, the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or heavy sandy loam,\nand rock fragments include 15 to 25 percent gravel and 20 to 45 percent cobbles and stones."

Elevations are 5,300 to 6,500 feet.  At elevations of 5,300 to 5,800 feet these soils are located in cold air drainages and rain shadows with annual temperatures of 40 degrees to 44 degrees F., but typically the temperature range is 44 degrees to 47 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 80 inches.  Frost-free days range from 40 to 65 days."
