    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The Al horizon has moist value of less than 3.5 throughout the upper 4 inches and chromas of 4 or more at depths of 2 to 8 inches. The combined thickness of the Al, B2t, and B3ca ranges from 50 to 60 inches or more over bedrock. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature range from 59 to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 65 consecutive days during the later part of the summer.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 110 percent in the A1 and B2t horizons and 0 to 30 percent in the B3ca horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist. It ranges from loam or light clay loam to sandy loam. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral and ranges from 2 to 8 inches thick\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist. It ranges from heavy silty clay loam to clay loam and has 35 to 40 percent clay in the upper 20 inches.  Structure ranges from weak medium prismatic to weak to strong, coarse subangular blocky or angular block. This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and ranges from 30 to 45 inches thick.\nThe B3ca horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.  It is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.  This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous."
