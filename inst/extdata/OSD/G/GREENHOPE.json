  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenhope Series consists of very deep, well drained soil formed in alluvium and alluvial fans derived dominantly from mixed sources.  Greenhope soils are on nearly level to rolling benches, terraces and hillslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 33 centimeters (13 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
