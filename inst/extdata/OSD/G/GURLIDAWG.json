  "OVERVIEW": "The Gurlidawg series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from glassy tuff. Gurlidawg soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
