Few gravel and cobbles are on\nthe surface and throughout the solum in some pedons.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except for the\nsurface layer in limed areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma\nof 2 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe B1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5\nto 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4\nto 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are in\nthe upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  The B2t horizon is clay, silty clay, or clay loam and contains more than 30 percent silt.  Few to common manganese concretions are in the B2t horizon\nin some pedons.  The Bx horizon is mottled in shades of gray,\nwhite, and brown.  Texture of the Bx horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is very hard and brittle."
