Bonnick soils have very gravelly or extremely gravelly textures within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Borobey soils have firm, brittle horizons within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Emamount soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have endosaturation between 60 and 72 inches from the soil surface.  Embal soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick, do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and have irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils are deep to buried duripans and do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section.  Picturerock soils have cambic horizons, horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,000 feet. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 26 to 29 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
