  "STATES": "KS,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilhula series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  The slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
