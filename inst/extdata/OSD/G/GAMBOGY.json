  "OVERVIEW": "The Gambogy series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium mainly from granitic rock sources. Gambogy soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
