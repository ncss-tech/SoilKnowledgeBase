  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from soft sedimentary bedrock such as tuff, siltstone, shale and tuffaceous sandstones.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,555 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
