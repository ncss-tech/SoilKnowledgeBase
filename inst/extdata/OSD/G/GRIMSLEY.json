Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely sandy loam and contains a weighted average of more than 20 percent clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.

Muskingum soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Ramsey soils are less than 20 inches deep over sandstone bedrock. Bouldin soils are on similar landscape positions and are very deep over bedrock.  Gilpin soils on adjacent convex slopes are moderately deep.  Petros soils are on adjacent convex slopes are shallow.  Gilpin and Petros soils are residuum from shale bedrock."
