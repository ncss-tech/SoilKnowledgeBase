    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale or sandstone bedrock and thickness of solum range from 40 to 60 inches.  Amount of fragments of sandstone and shale ranges from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 65 percent in the B and C horizons. Cobbles and stones a foot or several feet thick have accumulated on the surface in some of the low places.  The dominant size range of fragments is 2 to 12 inches but some are larger.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or sandy loam.\nThe BE or EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely sandy loam and contains a weighted average of more than 20 percent clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Bt or 2C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay."

In addition, Joppa soils formed in Coastal Plain sands and gravels.  Lostcove soils formed in colluvium of low grade metasedimentary rocks and are deeper than 60 inches over bedrock. Bendavis soils are less than 40 inches over residuum of cherty limestone.  Bender soils are less than 40 inches deep and formed in sandstone residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grimsley soils are on middle to lower backslopes and footslopes of mountains and steep hillsides.  Slope gradients are 8 to 70 percent.  The soil formed in colluvium containing a large amount of gravel, cobbles, and stones over shale residuum.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 55.4 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 55.5 inches."

Muskingum and Ramsey soils are on higher lying sideslopes of mountains.  Jefferson soils do not have as many fragments in the solum as the Grimsley soils.  Muskingum soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Ramsey soils are less than 20 inches deep over sandstone bedrock. Bouldin soils are on similar landscape positions and are very deep over bedrock.  Gilpin soils on adjacent convex slopes are moderately deep.  Petros soils are on adjacent convex slopes are shallow.  Gilpin and Petros soils are residuum from shale bedrock."
