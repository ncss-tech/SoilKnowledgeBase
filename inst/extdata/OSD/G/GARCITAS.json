  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 72 inches.  Water drains freely from the A1 horizon and is perched in thin layers for brief periods after rains in and above the B21tg horizon.\nThe A1 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light gray (10YR 7/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3).  The\nA2 horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2) or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 8/3).  The A horizon is gravelly or very gravelly loamy fine sand or fine sand.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.  Coarse fragments are mostly siliceous pebbles and cobbles, and range from\n15 to 80 percent by volume.\nThe B2tg horizons are light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2), light\nbrownish gray (10YR 6/2), or white (10YR 8/1, 8/2), and are\nmottled in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  They are gravelly\nclay or gravelly sandy clay.  The content of siliceous pebbles\nranges from about 15 to 35 percent by volume and decreases in\nvolume with increase in depth.  They are extremely acid to medium acid.  The B3 horizon is clay loam or sandy clay.  It is very\nstongly acid to medium acid.\nThe C horizons are variable and are mostly mottled loamy earth\nwith reaction ranging from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome C horizons have weak bedding planes with thin strata of fine sand and coarse fragments."

Demona soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 72 degrees F.  Ellen soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments\nin the control section.  Fordtran and Rahal soils have aquic\nmoisture regimes.  Leming soils are slightly acid through\nmoderately alkaline in the B2t horizons and contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Neuces and\nSarita soils have loamy control sections and in addition, Sarita soils have sandy A horizons more than 40 inches thick.  Poth soils lack gray mottles in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  Straber soils have A horizons less than 20 inches thick.  Tremona soils\nhave less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section."

The soil formed in loamy, clayey, and gravelly materials mainly in the Lissie Geologic Formations during the Pleistocene system.  Climate is subhumid.  Mean annual temperature\nis 70 degrees to 74 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 30\nto 40 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E index is 44 to 56."
