  "OVERVIEW": "The Garcitas series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained,\nvery slowly permeable soils formed in interbedded loamy, clayey,\nand gravelly materials of the Pleistocene system.  These nearly\nlevel to gently sloping soils are on knolls and low ridges.\nSlopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Water drains freely from the A1 horizon and is perched in thin layers for brief periods after rains in and above the B21tg horizon.\nThe A1 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light gray (10YR 7/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3).  The\nA2 horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2) or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 8/3).  The A horizon is gravelly or very gravelly loamy fine sand or fine sand.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.  Coarse fragments are mostly siliceous pebbles and cobbles, and range from\n15 to 80 percent by volume.\nThe B2tg horizons are light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2), light\nbrownish gray (10YR 6/2), or white (10YR 8/1, 8/2), and are\nmottled in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  They are gravelly\nclay or gravelly sandy clay.  The content of siliceous pebbles\nranges from about 15 to 35 percent by volume and decreases in\nvolume with increase in depth.  They are extremely acid to medium acid.  The B3 horizon is clay loam or sandy clay.  It is very\nstongly acid to medium acid.\nThe C horizons are variable and are mostly mottled loamy earth\nwith reaction ranging from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome C horizons have weak bedding planes with thin strata of fine sand and coarse fragments."
