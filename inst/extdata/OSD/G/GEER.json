Also, Apron soils have 2.5Y or 5Y hue and a sandy loam control section. Fruitland, Marcou and Jeddito soils are not moist 10 to 20 days following summer convection storms. Jenrid and Shotnick have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. Ganaflan, Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Wentridge, and Worland soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Fang and Mazuma soils have a stratified fine sandy loam and sandy loam control section with more than 30 percent fine sand and coarser. Tooele soils contain 15 to 35 percent sodium in the particle size control section. Trachute soils have 7.5YR hues. Kumiva soils have a Ck horizon. Piltdown soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer and have mean annual summer temperature of 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C. Sodaspring soils have a control section that averages gravelly coarse sandy loam."
