The reaction of the A and B horizons ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid except for surface layers that have been limed.  The\nIIB horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to\n4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3\nto 6.  Mottles in shades of brown range from few to many.  It is silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe IIBt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6,\nand chroma of 3 to 6.  Either brownish or grayish mottles or both range from few to many.  Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam,\nloam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand."

Armour and Hicks soils are underlain by limestone at depths of 4 to 10 feet.  Barnsdall, Dexter, Dossman, Gallion, and Rilla soils have upper B2t horizons with color hue of 5YR or\nredder.  Dubbs soils have a solum thickness of 25 to 55 inches and lack IIBt horizons.  Dundee soils are more poorly drained and have dominant 2 chroma colors in the B2t horizon.  Goldman soils are\nmore poorly drained and have 2 chroma mottles in the upper 10\ninches of the B2t horizon.  Sterlington soils have coarse-silty control sections."
