  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 7 to 16\ninches and corresponds to depth of the petrocalcic horizon.  The A horizon is brown, dark brown, very dark gray, or very dark grayish brown in hues of 7.5YR and 10YR with values of 3 and 4 and chromas\nof 1 and 2.  It is clay or clay loam and contains 0 to 15 percent\nby volume of siliceous and limestone pebbles.  Structure is blocky\nor subangular blocky.  Reaction ranges from neutral through mildly alkaline, but is noncalcareous.  The A horizon in some pedons has\na thin strata that is very gravelly and calcareous in the lower\npart.\nThe Ccam horizon is massive strongly cemented or indurated caliche containing about 30 to 70 percent by volume of chert and\nlimestone.  The IIC horizon is stratified very gravelly loams and sands.  In some pedons there are strata of weakly cemented nongravelly caliche."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Slaughter series in the same family and the Kavett, Mereta, Patrick, Queeny, Quihi, and Stephen series.  Slaughter, Mereta, and Kavett soils are drier for longer periods.  In addition, Slaughter soils have a Bt horizon and\nMereta and Kavett soils are calcareous.  Queeny soils are\ncalcareous and contain less than 35 percent in the control\nsection.  Patrick and Stephen soils lack petrocalcic horizons and\nare calcareous.  Quihi soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, have a Bt horizon, and have a\nsolum more than 20 inches thick."

The soils formed over thick beds of gravel deposited by streams of Pleistocene Age.  The climate is\nwarm and subhumid; mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30\nto 34 inches; mean annual temperature from about 65 degrees to 70 degrees F and the Thornthwaite P-E indices from 42 to 50."
