The soil between the depths of 8 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 15 and is moist the rest of the year.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 27 percent clay.  Base saturation is more than 50 percent throughout the profile.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.  Mollic epipedon is 24 inches thick or more and has mottles in the lower part.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.  Gravel fragment content is 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 3/1, or 3/2.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe BAt and Btg horizons are; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.
