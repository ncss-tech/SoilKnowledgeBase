  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a seasonal high water table ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  0 to 50 percent of the surface is covered with igneous pebbles.  The particle-size control section commonly has 2 to 12 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction of the profile is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Texture commonly is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist.  Matrix texture is loamy sand or sand with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers."
