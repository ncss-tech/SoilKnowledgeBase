  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Content of organic ranges from .2 to .8 percent in the surface horizons and decreases irregularly with depth.  The control section averages sandy loam, but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent, and sand from 50 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Content of coarse fragments is typically less than 5 percent and ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has fine granular or crumb structure, but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. It is soft to slightly hard when dry. This horizon ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to pH 8.6). It is usually calcareous throughout but may be leached for a few inches in some pedons. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to pH 8.6), and calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 12 percent. Visible secondary calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate may occur at any depth but is not concentrated into a continuous horizon."

Juva soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in at least some part of the control section. Thoroughfare soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Glenton soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and the lower ends of alluvial fans. Slope gradients range from 0 to about 6 percent. They formed in thick stratified but predominantly moderately coarse textured, calcareous alluvial parent sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock. At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F."
