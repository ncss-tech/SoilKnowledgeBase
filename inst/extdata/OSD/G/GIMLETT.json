  "OVERVIEW": "The Gimlett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that\nformed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Gimlett soils are on stream\nterraces and have slopes of 0 to 2  percent.  Permeability is moderate\nin the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 17 inches, and the average annual air\ntemperature is about 40 degrees F.",
