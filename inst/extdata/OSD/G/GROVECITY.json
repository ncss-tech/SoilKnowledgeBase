  "STATES": "IN,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Grovecity series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy till. They are on nearly level and convex slopes on moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 785 millimeters.",
