Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are the same as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, gray, or brown occur in the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.  Texture of the Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction of the Bt horizons is strongly acid to neutral."

They formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  The climate is dry subhumid or moist subhumid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64."

Dougherty, Eufaula, and Stidham soils have A and E horizons that combined are more than 20 inches thick and usually occur on slightly lower areas.  In addition, Eufaula soils have siliceous mineralogy and have a sandy control section.  Vanoss soils have a mollic epipedon and have a fine-silty control section.  In addition, Vanoss soils occur on prairie areas similar to the Galey soils."

Some of the more sloping areas are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly post oak, blackjack oak, and hickory trees with an understory of tall and mid grasses."
