  "OVERVIEW": "The Galey series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping convex terraces of uplands in the Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A and MLRA 84B).  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches. Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

Combined thickness of the A and E horizons range from 4 to 20 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are the same as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, gray, or brown occur in the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.  Texture of the Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction of the Bt horizons is strongly acid to neutral."

Dougherty, Eufaula, and Stidham soils have A and E horizons that combined are more than 20 inches thick and usually occur on slightly lower areas.  In addition, Eufaula soils have siliceous mineralogy and have a sandy control section.  Vanoss soils have a mollic epipedon and have a fine-silty control section.  In addition, Vanoss soils occur on prairie areas similar to the Galey soils."
