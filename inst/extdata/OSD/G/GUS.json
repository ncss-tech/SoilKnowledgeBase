  "OVERVIEW": "The Gus series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on the sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",
