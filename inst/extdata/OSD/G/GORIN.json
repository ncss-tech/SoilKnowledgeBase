  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in 30 to 50 inches of loess and in the underlying loamy sediments or loess, loamy sediments and a paleosol from glacial till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Keswick and Marion soils and the till derived Lindley soils. Lindley soils contain more sand in the upper part of the solum and have less clay. Marion soils have an abrupt textural change. Keswick and Lindley soils are on lower slopes.  Marion soils are in similar positions or upslope on more broad ridgetops."
