  "OVERVIEW": "The Gorin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loess and loamy sediments or loess, loamy sediments and a paleosol from glacial till. These soils are on ridgetops and have slopes ranging from 2 to 14 percent. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 35 inches.",
