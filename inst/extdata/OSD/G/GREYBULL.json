  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are typically calcareous to the surface but may be leached up to 10 inches in some pedons with coarser surfaces.  The particle size control section is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 52 percent sand with more than 15 but less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent soft shale chips which break down upon pretreatment.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is typically moderately but may be strongly alkaline in some pedons.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 15 percent and gypsum from 0 to 5 percent.  Over three-fourths of the carbonate and gypsum is autogenetic.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of olive and olive brown, calcareous shale.  These beds are from 10 to over 100 feet thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greybull soils are on bedrock controlled uplands and low rolling hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 3,800 to 6,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 9 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 135 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
