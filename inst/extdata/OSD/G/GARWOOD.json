  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "SEB-ACT-RM-AKS",
  "REVDATE": "07/2019",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Garwood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Lissie Formtion of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils occur on flats on coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",

The series classification change from mixed mineralogy to kaolinitic mineralogy is based on NSSL data (S1995TX089002) from the type location, and reference samples tested for mineralogy by Texas A&M University. The classification was changed from Albaquic Hapludalfs to Typic Hapludalfs during the update of MLRA 150A. Observations made during this time indicated aquic conditions did not occur. Episaturation only occurs during abnormally wet conditions.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 58 to 108 cm (23 to 43 in)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 58 cm (0 to 23 in) (Ap, A, E1, and E2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 58 to 203 cm (23 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 horizons)\nAbrupt textural change: at 58 cm (23 in) (contact between E2 and Bt1 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data on lab pedon number 95P0487 from the type location in Colorado County, Texas.
