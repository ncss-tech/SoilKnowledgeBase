    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated the depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface.) The thickness of the solum is dominantly 30 to 40 inches, but ranges from 24 to 50 inches and is the same depth to carbonates. Gravel content ranges from 2 to 10 percent in the solum and 5 to 15 percent in the substratum. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 throughout. The argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 15 percent clay and between 50 and 70 percent fine sand or coarser, and the series control section averages about 8 percent clay and between 50 and 70 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or is neutral, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 2. The A or Ap horizons are fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand. It is strongly acid or moderately acid. In some cultivated pedons, part of or the entire E horizon has been mixed with the Ap horizon.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction of the Bhs horizon is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nWhere there is no Bhs horizon the Bs or Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4. It is moderately acid. Where there is a Bhs horizon the Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. In this case reaction of the Bs horizon ranges is moderately acid or slightly acid. The Bs horizons are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a separate E' horizon below the Bs horizons with colors and textures similar to those of the E part of the E/B and B/E horizons. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E part of the E/B and B/E horizons has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 3. It is loamy sand or sandy loam. The B part of the E/B and B/E horizons has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. The E/B can have some characteristics of a fragipan. It can be hard and brittle when dry. The E/B or B/E are slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have separate Bt horizons which have similar colors and textures to the B part of the E/B and B/E horizons. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam. Lenses of loamy sand or sand occur in some pedons below 45 inches. It is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."

Abbaye and Mequithy soils are underlain by a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches. Alcona soils are underlain by stratified silt to loamy sand from 20 to 40 inches. Cheboygan soils have loamy sand or sand textures in the upper 20 to 40 inches of the series control section. Goodman and Sarona soils do not have carbonates within depths of 60 inches. Newot soils are underlain by dense till (Cd horizon or paralithic contact) at depths from 40 to 80 inches. Montcalm soils have E and Bt horizons within depths of 60 inches. Padus and Padwet soils have stratified sand and gravel within depths of 40 inches. Trenary and Ubly soils contain from 18 to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Sagola soils have carbonates at depths from 50 to 60 inches. Emmet soils do not have spodic horizons."
