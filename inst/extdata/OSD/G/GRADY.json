Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe BEg or EBg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.

Bayboro and Byars soils have an umbric epipedon; in addition, Bayboro soils have mixed mineralogy. Bladen, Cantey, and Leaf soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons. Coxville soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the upper B horizon. Dunbar soils have dominant chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches of the soil surface. Rains soils have less clay in the control section.  Rembert soils have a loamy sand C horizon within 60 inches of the soil surface."
