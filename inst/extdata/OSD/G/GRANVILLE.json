  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  These soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout, except when the surface is limed.  Exchangeable aluminum ranges from 6 to 13 meq/100g in the control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Pedons in which value is darker than 3.5 when moist and 5.5 when dry, are less than 6 inches thick.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  The eroded phase is typically sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe BE or BA horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown range from none to common.  It is commonly sandy clay loam or clay loam, but can include thin layers of loam.  Silt content averages less than 30 percent in the upper 20 inches of this horizon.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  They are sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon may be multicolored or mottled or have similar base colors as the Bt horizon with mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  It is saprolite weathered from Triassic sandstone and shale.  Typically, it has sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam texture."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Soil series in the same family are Apison, Cahaba, Durham, Emporia, Euharlee, Hartsells, Kempsville, Linker, Nauvoo, Oktaha, Olla, Pirum, Sipsey, Smithdale, Spadra, Stringtown, and Suffolk.   Apison, Hartsells, Linker, and Sipsey soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches of the soil surface.  Cahaba, Nauvoo, Smithdale, and Spadra have 5YR or redder hue in the Bt horizon.  In addition, Nauvoo soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Durham and Emporia soils have moderately slow or slow permeability in the lower part of the subsoil.  In addition, Emporia soils have low chroma mottles indicative of wetness below about 36 inches.  Euharlee soils have more than 30 percent silt in the particle size control section.  Kempsville and Suffolk soils have less than 6 meq/100 grams of exchangeable aluminum.  Olla soils formed in marine sediments and are stratified, and in addition commonly contain ironstone or concentrations of iron in thin horizontal lenses.  Pirum soils have bedrock within 22 to 50 inches of the surface.  Stringtown soils have 1 to 4 percent by volume plinthite in the lower Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Granville soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping ridges in the Piedmont uplands.  Slopes commonly are 2 to 6 percent and range from 0 to 10 percent.  This soil formed in material weathered from Triassic sandstone and shale.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches."

All of these soils have formed in residuum weathered from Triassic sandstone and shale.  Creedmoor, Mayodan, and White Store soils have clayey Bt horizons.  In addition, Creedmoor and White Store soils have very slow permeability in the subsoil and moderate or high shrink-swell potential.  Hallison and Mooshaunee soils are in a fine silty family and have soft bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches, and 20 to 40 inches respectively.  Pinkston soils are in a coarse-loamy family and have hard bedrock within 20 to 40 inches of the surface."

Principal crops are tobacco, corn, cotton, soybeans, small grains, and truck crops.  Common trees are white, red, black, and post oaks; hickory, sweetgum, red maple, sourwood, and dogwood.  Shortleaf, Virginia, and loblolly pines are common in places, especially old fields."
