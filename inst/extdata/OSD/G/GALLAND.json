  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 36 to 72 inches in thickness.  Carbonates are not present in the solum and to a depth of several feet in the C horizon.  Pebbles and coarser fragments are lacking in the upper 30 inches of the solum, but they are in strata in some pedons below this depth.  The solum is medium acid to very strongly acid in the most acid part.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1).\nCultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon typically is loam but is clay loam in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon is quite variable in texture over short distances but typically is clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Clay content averages about 38 to 45 percent but ranges from 35 to 48 percent.  The Bt horizon typically has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 6.  In at least part of the Bt horizon, hues of 7.5YR or redder are present as matrix colors or as many distinct or prominent mottles.  Chroma of 1 with value of 4 or 5 are within the range when such horizons have many distinct reddish and yellowish brown mottles with hues of 7.5YR or redder.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y with values of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.  Moderately coarse to fine textured sediments high in quartz are common in the lower part of the BC horizon and in the C horizon.  Strata of sandy loam are less than 6 inches thick where they are as shallow as 40 inches in depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colp, Gorin, Jackland, Keswick, and Weller soils in the same family and the Adair, Armstrong, Caleb, Douds, Lindley, Lineville, and Mystic series.  Colp soils have less sand in their sola and lack 5YR hues in the Bt horizon.  Gorin soils are lower in sand in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Jackland soils are formed in residuum that weathered from diabase and basalt.  The Keswick, Adair, and Armstrong soils contain a pebble band in the upper part of the solum, contain stones and pebbles throughout the major part of the B horizon, and lack stratification in the lower part of the B and C horizons.  Weller soils formed in loess and contain less sand throughout the B horizons.  Caleb soils lack 7.5YR or 5YR hues as matrix colors in the Bt horizon.  Douds soils have less clay in the Bt horizon and lack mottles in the upper part of the B horizon.  Lindley soils have less clay in the B horizon and lack stratification in the lower part of the B and C horizons.  Lineville soils average less than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon, are deeper to horizons of maximum clay, and are less stratified in the C horizon. Mystic soils have a thicker A horizon or a darker colored Ap horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Galland soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes of high stream terraces that border valleys of major streams and their tributaries.  The areas are distinctly higher in elevation than the modern flood plain but are lower in elevation than the late Wisconsinan recent dissection slopes on which the Shelby, Gara, and Lindley soils formed.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 18 percent.  Galland soils formed in late Sangamon paleosols which formed in alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Douds and Lindley soils and the Gara soils.  The Douds soils are downslope from the Galland soils on that portion of the interfluve which has been truncated in recent (Wisconsinan) time.  Gara or Lindley soils commonly are upslope on that portion of the glacial till slope that was dissected in late Wisconsinan time.  Gara soils contain less clay in the Bt horizons."

Competing series and other updates will be made later.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon); albic horizon - the zone from a depth of 5 to 9 inches (E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from a deptth of 9 to 38 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nWater table depth and drainage class have been updated by agreement by the MLRA 108 steering committee on water table depths and drainage class, 4/98\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
