    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the paralithic contact range from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the upper horizons ranges from 1 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with depth the soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated.  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are usually less than 5 percent and are mainly small sandstone fragments.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 70 degrees F.\nSome pedons have an A horizon up to 3 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has texture of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It has platy, granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E/B and B/E horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand in the E part and sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam in the B part.  Fine sandy loam is allowed in the B part of the E/B horizon.  The horizons are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  The horizon has prismatic, subangular or angular blocky structure.  It has oriented clay films in some part.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe C/Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam in the B part and fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand in the C part.  It is medium acid to neutral.  The Bt part occurs as lamella.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is interbedded sandstone and shale.  Some pedons exhibit lamellae in the fracture planes in the paralithic bedrock material."

Augustine, Celacy, Dermala, Goesling, Lykorly, Maia, Pinitos and Ribera soils are presumed to be competing pending an update of the classification.  Arwite, Augustine, Dalhart, Deekay, Dermala, Flugle, Fort Collins, Goesling, Iwela, Lykorly, Maia, Olnest, Orlie, Parkelei, Pinitos, Rauzi, Stoneham and Wagonhound soils are very deep. Bosonoak soils occur above elevations of 6500 feet and receive most of their precipitation between July and October.  Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Celacy soils are moist in some parts of the moisture control section during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  Elwop and Oldwolf soils do not have lamellae or glossic horizons.  Toluca soils have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 inches or less.  Rockybutte soils are moderately deep to porcellanite."
