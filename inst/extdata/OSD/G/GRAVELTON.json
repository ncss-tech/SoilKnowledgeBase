  "OVERVIEW": "The Gravelton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on flood plains. They formed in loamy sediments underlain by stratified sandy and gravelly alluvium. They are moderately deep to the underlying sandy or gravelly material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
