  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Garveson series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hillslopes and mountain slopes. They formed in volcanic ash over residuum weathered from gneiss or granitic bedrock. Slope ranges from 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 1,150 mm.",
