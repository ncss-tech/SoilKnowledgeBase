The CEC activity class placement (active) is based on nine NSSL characterization pedons. Five are active, two each are semiactive and superactive.\nRevised 1/93- BLW-JCL-ART; 7/2002-ABJ,DHK\nNSSL mineralogy data from seven West Virginia pedons of Guyandotte indicate mixed mineralogy, but are close to siliceous. Coarse silt and fine sand fraction grain counts range from 69 to 93 percent resistant minerals for individual horizons, but all seven pedons are classified as mixed with weighted averages from about 75 to 89 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features present in the profile are:\na.) Umbric epipedon - 1 to 13 inches (A1, A2 and A3 horizons.)\nb.) Cambic horizon - 13 to 65 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)."
