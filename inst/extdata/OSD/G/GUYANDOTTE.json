  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n03/2013 Revision was to fix hyperlink and very minor formatting.\nThe 9/2011 revision updates Guyandotte soils to the Eleventh Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2010), adds latitude and longitude, converts units to metric, and updates competing series.\nThe 7/2002 revision updates Guyandotte soils to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1998). The CEC activity class placement (active) is based on nine NSSL characterization pedons. Five are active, two each are semiactive and superactive.\nRevised 1/93- BLW-JCL-ART; 7/2002-ABJ,DHK\nNSSL mineralogy data from seven West Virginia pedons of Guyandotte indicate mixed mineralogy, but are close to siliceous. Coarse silt and fine sand fraction grain counts range from 69 to 93 percent resistant minerals for individual horizons, but all seven pedons are classified as mixed with weighted averages from about 75 to 89 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features present in the profile are:\na.) Umbric epipedon - 1 to 13 inches (A1, A2 and A3 horizons.)\nb.) Cambic horizon - 13 to 65 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to NSSL characterization pedons S86WV-109- 002 (typical pedon), S82KY-195-012, S84KY-095-007, S86WV-005-001, S86WV-005-002, S86WV-045-002, S86WV-059-001, S86WV059-004, and S86WV-067-001 for laboratory data.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA: WV0069\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
