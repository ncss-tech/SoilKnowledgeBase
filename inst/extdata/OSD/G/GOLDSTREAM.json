  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The histic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick and may include part of the A horizon.  The depth to permafrost ranges from 2 to 20 inches from the surface of the mineral soil.  Cryoturbation is evident in some horizons above the permafrost table. Texture of the control section is silt loam or silt with thin lenses of fine sand scattered throughout.  On a weighted average, the control section contains less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The entire profile contains substantial mica, but less than 40 percent by weight.  Reaction is extremely to very strongly acid in the organic layers and very strongly to strongly acid in the mineral horizons.\nThe O horizons range from coarse organic matter with many living roots to moderately decomposed finely divided organic matter.\nThe A horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 2 to 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.\nB horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe C horizons have hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 0 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or silt."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Goldstream soils occupy broad nearly level alluvial plains along major rivers, and the bottoms and footslopes of upland drainageways.  The soils formed in silty alluvium that is moderately high in mica.  The climate is cold continental.  Mean annual temperatures range from 20 to 26 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Bolio, Jarvis, Lemeta, Salchaket, and Tanana soils.  Bolio and Lemeta soils are organic soils occurring in depressions on floodplains.  Jarvis and Salchaket soils occur in similar positions but are well drained and lack permafrost.  Tanana soils are poorly drained soils in similar positions and have thinner organic mats."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Slow runoff to ponded.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat, moderate in the mineral layers above the permafrost, and impermeable in the permafrost.\nAltered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level with subsequent lowering of the water table."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include:  histic epipedon from 8 inches to 0 in the organic mat and including the A horizon; permafrost at 17 inches with saturated conditions above; coarse-silty particle size from 0 to 27 inches; pH less than 5.5 (1:1, H2O) throughout.\nDisturbance to the organic mat such as by buring or clearing will alter the thermal regime of the soil. Often, as a result, the permafrost and the water table will drop below the series control section.\nType location moved from the Salcha-Big Delta Area to the Greater Fairbanks Area.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
