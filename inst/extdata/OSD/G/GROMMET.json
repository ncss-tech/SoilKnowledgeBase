  "OVERVIEW": "The Grommet series are well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources. Grommet soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
