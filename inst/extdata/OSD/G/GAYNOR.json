  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually calcareous at the surface but are leached for a few inches in some pedons.  Depth to the underlying paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the surface horizon is .8 to 1.5 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Conductivity ranges from less than 1 to about 3 millimhos and exchangeable sodium percentage usually ranges from less than 1 percent throughout the control section.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from approximately 60 to 80 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  The control section is usually heavy silty clay loam or light silty clay but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 30 to 55 percent, and sand from 5 to 30 percent, with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent but are usually less than 2 percent and confined mostly to shale chips.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 58 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 79 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Its primary structure usually is granular or crumb but is weak subangular blocky in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard and moderately alkaline or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and contains about 2 to 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Usually there are a few crystals of calcium sulfate throughout this horizon but amount and placement of visible secondary calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate is erratic from pedon to pedon and horizons are discontinuous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Biedsaw, Bodot, Bone, and Vananda series.  Bodot soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section from April to July 15. Bone soils have a thin horizon that qualifies as a natric horizon except for\nthickness.  Biedsaw and Vananda soils lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gaynor soils are on hill sides and ridge crests.  Slope gradients range from about 2 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in thin calcareous sediments weathered residually from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 68 degrees F."
