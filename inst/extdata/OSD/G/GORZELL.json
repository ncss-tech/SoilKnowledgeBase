  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gorzell soils are on smooth, gently sloping to moderately steep high lacustrine terraces at elevations of 1,375 to 1,750 meters.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from tuffs, andesite and basalts.  Both have been derived primarily from tuffs, andesite, and basalt.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm with most of it coming in the form of snow.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 9 degrees C."

Nevadash soils lack unconformable very gravelly sandy C horizons.  Schamp soils have clay B2t horizons and lack silica cementation.  Vylach soils have strongly cemented duripans."
