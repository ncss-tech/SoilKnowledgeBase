  "OVERVIEW": "The Golden series consists of very poorly drained soils that are shallow to bedrock.  They formed in glacial outwash on toeslopes, shoulders of structural benches and mid elevation ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Texture of the control section is dominantly fine sandy loam but includes loamy fine sand and strata of very fine sandy loam and loamy sand.  The fine earth fraction contains less than 50 percent very fine sand.  Weighted average coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent gravel.  Reaction of the profile ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nAn Oi or Oe horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y or neutral, value from 3 to 5, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Mottles when present have hue ranging from 10YR to neutral, value of 3 or 4, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 3 or 4, and chroma from 0 to 4.  Mottles have hue of 7.5YR or neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma from 0 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sand loam.
