    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cline (AZ)(T), Crosgrain (NV), Greyeagle (CA), Longjim (NV), Marsite (CA) and Tumarion (AZ)(T) series. Crosgrain, Greyeagle, and Longjim soils have unconsolidated alluvium below the hardpan.  Cline soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September.  Marsite soils are over hard basalt bedrock and are dry in the moisture control section for longer period due to a lower rainfall component.  Tumarion soils are shallow to basalt bedrock and average more than 15 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days."
