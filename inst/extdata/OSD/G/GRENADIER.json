  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 degrees F.   Mean summer soil temperature is 54 degrees F. without an 0 horizon and less than 47 degrees F. with an 0 horizon at least 4 inches thick.  Thin A horizons may overlie the E horizon in some pedons.  The particle-size control section is normally loam, sandy clay loam, or light clay loam modified with rock fragments, but in the matrix material clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent.   Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent in the major part of the particle-size control section.  The solum is slightly acid through very strongly acid. The moisture control section is dry in some part for 15 to 30 days when the temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe BC or C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam."

Bensley soils are usually moist with precipitation dominantly in the winter and early spring.  The Endlich, Heterwa, Klootch, and Snotown soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  The Henson soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperatures less than 44 degrees F.  The Ivywild soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  The Jeru, Klootch, Koffgo, and Leighcan soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section.  The Marsell soils have hues of 5YR and redder in the Bw horizon.  Oatman soils lack continuous E horizons and have a precipitation pattern that is dominant in the winter and early spring."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Grenadier soils are on ridges, valley side slopes, or glacial troughs.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in thick, strongly acid, medium to moderately fine textured material derived from mixed crystalline rocks or slates and partly metamorphosed shale.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 22 to 32 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation in all months.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 9,500 to 11,200 feet."
