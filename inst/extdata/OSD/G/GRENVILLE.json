  "OVERVIEW": "The Grenville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous, dense till.  They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on low hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C. (45 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 1000 mm (39 in).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates range from 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 in). Depth to densic material is 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the  solum, and from 5 to 50 percent in the  substratum. Some pedons have few to common redoximorphic concentrations above the densic substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is  silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and it is calcareous. Some pedons have a friable C layer up to 51 cm (20 in) thick above the Cd."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grenville soils are nearly level to moderately steep. They are on low hills and ridges on till plains, and in many places associated with lacustrine deposits in nearby depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Elevation ranges from 30 to 240 meters (98 to 780 feet) above sea level. These soils formed in deposits dominated by dolomitic limestone with varying proportions of calcic limestone and granitic material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm (31 to 59 in), and mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). The frost free period ranges from 100 to 160 days."

Hogansburg,  Malone, and Runeberg soils occupy lower topographic positions and are drainage associates. Nehasne soils are less than 40 in to bedrock. Pyrities and Kalurah soils do not have free carbonates within a depth of 40 in. Raquette soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Waddington soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section."
