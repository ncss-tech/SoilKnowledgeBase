  "OVERVIEW": "The Gassville series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum from dolomite bedrock.  These soils occur on ridgetops and sideslopes of the Salem Plateau in the Ozark Highlands, MLRA 116A in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

The A horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid and the B horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly silt loam or its very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analog.  Coarse fragments of chert and dolomite range from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly silt loam or its very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analog.  Coarse fragments of chert and dolomite range from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe BE horizon  has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly silty clay loam, or their very cobbly analogues.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4, 6 or 8.  Texture is gravelly clay or gravelly silty clay.  Iron accumulation and depletions are in shades of brown or yellow.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  The average clay content in the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 85 percent.\nThe Bt2, and Bt3 horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4, 6, or 8, or with value of 4 and chroma of 4 or 6, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or yellow.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Texture is clay, silty clay or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered dolomite bedrock that can be cut with a spade.\nThe R horizon is typically hard, level-bedded, dolomite bedrock with seams and pocket of nodular chert fragments of the Cotter Formation."
