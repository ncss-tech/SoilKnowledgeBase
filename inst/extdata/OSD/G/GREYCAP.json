  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "08/2006",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Greycap series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone of the Greenhorn member of the Mancos Shale formation, with some sandstone eolian influence on the surface.  Greycap soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
