  "OVERVIEW": "The Ganaflan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks and tufa deposits.  Ganaflan soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

In central Nevada elevations range as high as 1,465 to 1,770 meters, but are atypical for the series.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
