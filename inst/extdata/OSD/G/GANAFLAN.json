The paralithic materials are thinly bedded layers of tufa.  Tufa is a chemical sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate and silica and deposited from solution in the water of springs adjacent to lakes.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent. Some pedons have thin strata with up to 27 percent clay.\nRock fragments: Averages less than 35 percent gravel.  Lithology of fragments is tufa.\nA horizon\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSalinity (EC): 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nSodicity (SAR): 13 to 45.\nC horizons\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Dominantly gravelly loam or loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ganaflan soils are on lake terraces associated with Lake Lahontan and other Pleistocene lakes.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks and tufa deposits.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,190 to 1,345 meters.  In central Nevada elevations range as high as 1,465 to 1,770 meters, but are atypical for the series.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."

Smaug soils are very deep, coarse-silty, and occur on lake terraces.  Trocken soils are very deep, loamy-skeletal, and occur on fan remnants."
