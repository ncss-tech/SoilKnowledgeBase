  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilbert series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed loess and loamy sediments of late Pleistocene Age.  These soils are on broad flats or narrow depressional areas.  Slope gradients are less than 1 percent.",

Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 35 percent within 17 to 40 inches of the upper boundary of the B horizon.  Reaction, except for surface layers that have been limed, ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid in the A and E horizons and the upper part of the B horizon and from neutral to strongly alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  The effective cation exchange capacity typically ranges from 15 to 50 percent or more, saturated with exchangeable aluminum within 30 inches of the soil surface.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles, where present, are in shades of brown or gray.  Tongues of the E horizon as much as 4 inches wide extend between prisms in the upper part of the Btg horizon.\nThe Btg and Btgn horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the upper part and loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the lower part.  Mottles in shades of brown or gray range from few to many."
