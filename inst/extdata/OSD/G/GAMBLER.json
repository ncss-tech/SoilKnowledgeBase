Depth to hard lithic bedrock and solum thickness to the base of the Bt horizon ranges 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and are dominantly stones.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe E/B horizon has intermediate colors from the E and the Bt horizons, and are blotches about the rock fragments.  Hues are 2.5Y through 7.5YR, with value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, with chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures are clay loam or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 27 to 35 percent.\nThe transitional BC horizon is similar in color and texture to the Bt horizon.\nA thin layer of C material is typically above the lithic bedrock."

They formed over residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and trachyte.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 28 inches.The mean annual air temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F., and mean summer air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 75 days."

A lithic contact is at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  This revision also documents a change in classification from Typic to Glossic Cryoboralfs.
