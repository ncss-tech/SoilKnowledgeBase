  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 45 to 80 inches or more.  The till commonly is at depths of 30 to 40 inches, but is as deep as 45 inches in some pedons and is at the surface in others. Exchangeable sodium in concentrations of 5 to 15 percent is in one or more subhorizons between 10 and 40 inches.  An exchangeable sodium concentration greater than 15 percent is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section averages between 20 and 30 percent clay and between 15 and 30 percent sand coarser than very fine. The average content of gravel throughout the series control section ranges from a few pebbles to 5 percent.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (4 to 6 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline depending on the liming history.\nSome pedons have E, EB, or BE horizons.  Where present, these horizons individually are between 2 and 8 inches in thickness and have color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt, Btg, Btng, 2Bt, 2Btg,or 2Btng horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or less commonly 7.5YR; value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redox features have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 7.5YR, or 5YR, or neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 8.  Exteriors of peds have coatings with chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to strongly alkaline in the upper part and from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  Carbonates are common, but are not everywhere present.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2BCtng or 2BC, and C or 2C) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons are variegated, with no dominant color, in which the full range of the colors is hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 0 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons contain carbonates\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is underlain by buried horizons of older soils, and other pedons do not have a C horizon; where the modern soil is welded to a strongly developed paleosol.  These horizons have a wide range of both colors and textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grantfork soils are on erosional side slopes of the dissected Illinoian till plain, primarily along drainageways.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent. These soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  These soils formed in loamy erosional sediments as much as 45 inches in thickness and the underlying till or, in some pedons, formed entirely in till. The loamy sediments contain an admixed increment of loess in some pedons, but rarely a loess mantle because these soils are on erosional surfaces.  The till contains a strongly developed paleosol that has undergone various degrees of erosion, truncation, and resaturation with sodium.  Mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 200, and elevation is 400 to 750 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blair, Darmstadt, Elco, Hickory, and Tamalco soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Blair soils are adjacent on similar parts of the dissected Illinoian till plain.  Darmstadt, Elco, and Tamalco soils are upslope from Grantfork soils and have loess in the upper part of their sola and dominating their control section.  The well drained Hickory soils are downslope from these soils and they do not have 5 percent or more exchangeable sodium in the subsoil."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Rapid runoff.  Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the soil, and slow in the horizons that contain 5 percent or more exchangeable sodium.  In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is 0.5 foot to 2.0 feet from December to April in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this soil include:  Ochric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 inches (Ap horizon).  Argillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 5 to 67 inches (Bt, Btg, Btng1, Btng2, 2Btng3, 2Btng4, and 2BCtng horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic episaturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nAvailable laboratory data shows that these soils contain less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the subsoil, or that the sodium is too deep in the solum to meet the requirements of a natric horizon.  Some pedons have a B:A clay ratio of 1.2 or greater, but most do not because of accelerated erosion.\nThe texture and color of the soil varies over a wide range in these soils depending upon the amount of truncation and erosion.  The reaction varies over a wide range because of the degree of resaturation of the weathered solum.  The source of the sodium is leachate believed to have originated from chemical weathering of sodium feldspars in the loess of soils upslope.\nThe typical pedon was resampled and described to 80 inches for this revision (5/98).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from several pedons are on file in the NRCS/USDA state office in Champaign, Illinois.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
