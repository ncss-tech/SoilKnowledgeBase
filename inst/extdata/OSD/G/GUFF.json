(0 to 36 cm thick)\nR--99 cm; weathered limestone bedrock. A thin discontinuous grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam layer of saprolite immediately overlies the bedrock. This layer contains about 20 percent weathered rock fragments."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 102 cm. The depth to carbonates commonly ranges from 46 to 102 cm, however, carbonates are absent in some pedons. The depth to bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 cm. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and B horizons and from 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Dry values are 4 or 5. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, silt loam, or clay loam, and includes mucky analogues. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BCg and Cg horizons, when present, are similar in color to the Bg horizon but differ in having free carbonates. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or silt loam. Thin 2C horizons composed of nonconforming glacial till or saprolite are in some pedons. Reaction of the BCg and Cg horizons is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Adjidaumo soils are very deep to bedrock.\nThe Guffin, Matoon, Muskellunge and Wegatchie series are similar soils in other families. Matoon, Muskellunge, and Wegatchie soils are very deep to bedrock. Guffin soils have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Guff soils are on nearly level plains. They formed in clayey marine-deposited sediments that are relatively thin over underlying flat bedded sedimentary rock. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm. The growing season ranges from 100 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 45 to 175 meters above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adjidaumo, Hannawa, Heuvelton, Malone, Matoon, Muskellunge and Ogdensburg soils. Adjidaumo soils are on similar topographic positions but are deeper to bedrock. Hannawa soils are on similar topographic positions but are coarse-loamy. Heuvelton, Malone, Matoon, Muskellunge and Ogdensburg soils are on higher landscape positions. Heuvelton soils are moderately well drained. Malone and Ogdensburg soils belong to coarse-loamy families, and Matoon and Muskellunge soils have a layer above 30 inches where high chroma colors exceed 40 percent of the soil matrix."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the surface, and low or moderately low in the subsoil and substratum."
