    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grubstake soils are on pediments, mountains and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. These soils formed from residuum from granitoid sources. Elevations range from 730 to 1,250 meters (2,395 to 4,100 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (62.5 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

Cajon soils are on fan aprons amongst pediments, are very deep, are sandy throughout the particle size control section and do not have a diagnostic horizon. Pinecity soils are on north-facing mountain sideslopes, are sandy throughout the particle size control section, and do not have a diagnostic horizon above a shallow paralithic contact. Seanna and Stranger soils are on similar landscape positions, but Seanna soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and no diagnostic horizons. Stranger soils are sandy throughout, also do not have any diagnostic horizons and are very shallow to hard granitoid bedrock."
