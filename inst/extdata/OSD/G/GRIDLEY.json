  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. the entire year.  The difference between average July and average January soil temperature is 30 degrees to 33 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 6 and 17 inches is dry in all parts from June through October unless irrigated, and is moist in some or all parts from November thru May unless irrigated. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2 or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 5/3, 6/4, 5/4 or 7.5YR 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/4 or 4/6.  It is clay loam, clay, or silty clay with 35 to 55 percent clay, and a 5 to 10 percent (absolute) increase over the A horizon.\nSome pedons have a calcareous C horizon above the 2Cr horizon."

Gabino soils have 10 to 30 percent rock fragments in the solum, and 5YR hue in the argillic horizon.  Marcum soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Los Osos soils are well drained and have a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures at about 14 degrees F., medium acid to neutral, and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  Todos soils have Bt horizon hues of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Sespe soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon, and have a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature of 10 degrees to 17 degrees F.  Sween soils have a lithic contact at depths of 24 to 40 inches and have a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature of 19 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gridley soils are on low terraces and basin rims. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources deposited over unrelated siltstone.  Siltstone is fractured and mottled and is hard in the upper part, but becomes softer with depth and may be 2 feet to many feet thick.  Elevations are 20 to 80 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 260 to 20 days."

Conejo and Tisdale soils are on alluvial fans and terraces, are fine-loamy, and lack argillic horizons.  Oswald and Subaco soils are on basin rims and in basins and have clay textures throughout."
