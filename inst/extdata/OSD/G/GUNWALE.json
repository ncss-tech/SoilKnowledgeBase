Elevations are 700 to 1200 feet (213 to 366 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 610 mm), the mean annual temperature is 56 to 61 degrees F. (13 to 16 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 320 to 365 days."
