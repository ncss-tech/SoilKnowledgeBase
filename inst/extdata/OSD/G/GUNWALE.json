  "REVDATE": "02/2007",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gunwale series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from diorite and gabbro. Gunwale soils are on mountains and hills on islands. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees (14 degrees C.)",

Elevations are 700 to 1200 feet (213 to 366 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 610 mm), the mean annual temperature is 56 to 61 degrees F. (13 to 16 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 320 to 365 days."
