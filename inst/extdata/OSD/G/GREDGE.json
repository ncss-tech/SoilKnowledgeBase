  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The boundary between the A and Bt horizons is abrupt to clear, with some waviness evident.  Clay content decreases by 20 percent or more within a depth of 20 to 35 inches of the surface.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from none to few below a depth of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon averages less than 10 inches thick but is 15 inches thick in some subsoil troughs.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A thin E horizon is present in some pedons.  Siliceous pebbles range from 0 to 60 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons are mixed with these colors and, in addition, have hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. The low chroma colors are not indicative of current wetness conditions.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  All pedons are mixed in shades of brown, red and yellow.  If not mixed the matrix is light brownish gray or grayish brown.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt3 and Bt4 horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, red, or yellow.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BCt horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Some pedons have a matrix color of grayish brown, light gray, or reddish yellow with or without mottles.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  The matrix is typically noncalcareous.\nSome pedons have a geologic 2C horizon of shale, mudstone or stratified soil materials below a depth of 60 inches.  These materials have texture mainly of loam, clay loam or clay.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some spots are calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cadell, Chazos, Payne, and Zack series.   Similar soils are the Axtell, Burlewash, Crockett, Edge, and Tabor series.  Cadell soils are 40 to 60 inches thick over tuffaceous clay.  Chazos soils have a loamy fine sand surface layer 10 to 20 inches thick.   Payne soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the epipedon and argillic horizon.  Zack soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick over weakly consolidated mudstones.  The Axtell, Crockett, and Tabor soils classify in a vertic subgroup.  Burlewash soils have a paralithic contact of tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Edge soils are on uplands and have sola 40 to 60 inches thick over geologic materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gredge soils are on convex and linear gently sloping to moderately sloping erosional terraces associated with uplands.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 3 percent but range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in slightly acid to alkaline loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene Age mainly over the Yagua geology.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 69 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches. Frost free days range from 240 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 450 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 48 to 64."

The Axtell, Edge, Crockett, Gasil and Silawa soils are on similar landscape positions.  Gasil and Silawa soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Lufkin soils are on slightly lower nearly level positions or in depressions. They have grayish colors throughout, and are in a vertic subgroup."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Native vegetation is a Savannah consisting of post oak and blackjack oak trees with yaupon, little bluestem, longleaf uniola, panicums and paspalums. Many areas have been cultivated in the past.  Improved pastures of coastal bermudagrass and bahiagrass are the dominant use."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils were formerly included in the Axtell and Edge series (Brazos County, 1958).  Gredge soils have a high shrink-swell in the Bt1, then decrease in clay so that the shrink-swell potential is moderate to low in the remainder of the solum.  They lack the necessary PLE to classify as vertic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - 7 to 68 inches (Bt Horizons).\nThe low chroma colors are not indicative of current wetness.\nAbrupt texture change - at 7 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
