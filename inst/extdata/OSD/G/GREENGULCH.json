It is silt loam in the upper part of the horizon and silty clay loam in the lower part.  It is slightly acid to moderately acid. After mixing the upper 7 inches, chroma moist is 4.\nThe Bt horizon has  value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 55 percent clay.

These soils formed in fine textured residuum and colluvium derived from granodiorite intrusions in the Dothan, Galice, and Rogue formations.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 2200 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The frost free period is 120 to 200 days."
