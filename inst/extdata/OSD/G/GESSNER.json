(Btg1, Btg2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 110 cm (0 to 43 in) (A, Btg1, Btg2 horizons)\nAdditional Comments:  These soils were previously mapped as depressions and low flat areas as a consociation or in complex with other soils on the Lissie Formation in Harris County.  The series is now confined to enclosed depressions.  The original Gessner series type location as established during the initial survey for Harris County and the subsequent type location were destroyed by urban encroachment.  Classification is revised to a fine-loamy particle-size control section based on lab data at the new series type location and documentation obtained during the update mapping for MLRA 150A. Also the classification is updated from Glossaqualfs to Vermaqualfs due to revision of Soil Taxonomy.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on lab data from the new Gessner series type location in Harris County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil characterization data is available on pedon S92TX-201-001 from the new series type location in Harris County, Texas.  Soil moisture monitoring data is available from TAMU research conducted by Susan Starowitz as part of her master's thesis at the new series type location.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
