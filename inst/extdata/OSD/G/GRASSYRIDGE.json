  "OVERVIEW": "The Grassyridge series consists of deep or very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils in calcareous eolian deposits on basalt plains.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
