  "OVERVIEW": "The Geneva series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils. They formed in weakly consolidated fluvial marine deposits of loamy and clayey sediments of the Wilcox group of the Tertiary system. These moderately steep to steep soils occur on side slopes of hills and interfluves on Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B). Slope ranges from 15 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,346 mm (53 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
