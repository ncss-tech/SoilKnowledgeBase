  "OVERVIEW": "The Gachado series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium from volcanic rock.  Gachado soils are on hills and mountains with slopes of 0 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
