The soils formed in alluvium from andesite, latite, rhyolite, basalt, schist and tuff.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches and falls mainly as thunderstorms in July-September, and as gentle rains during January and February.  Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 76 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 250 to 325 days."
