  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 in). Rock fragments are typically absent, but range up to 3 percent in the BC horizon and 10 percent in the C horizon. Stratification is evident within the series control section. Some pedons have carbonates in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. An A horizon, where present, is 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick and has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to medium, granular. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Areas that have been limed are slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick and has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular or angular blocky. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular or angular blocky. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have a BE or B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Some pedons have strata of loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, or weak or moderate, medium or coarse, prismatic, or thin to thick platy. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have a thin layer with slight brittleness in the middle or lower part of the Bt horizons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, with strata of fine sandy loam in some pedons. Structure is weak, coarse subangular or angular blocky, or coarse prismatic, or thin to thick platy. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is commonly stratified silt, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Some pedons have strata of loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay, or lenses of very fine sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Appleriver, Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook, Freeburg, Geff, Keene, Muren, Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox, and Xenia series. Appleriver, Keene, Muren, Reesville and Xenia soils lack stratification in the series control section. Blair, Fishhook, and Geff soils have a thicker solum. Bunkum and Freeburg soils have higher mean annual temperatures. Sugarvalley and Torox soils have a lithologic discontinuity (loess over till) and also lack stratification in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glenford soils formed in stratified Wisconsinan age glaciolacustrine or stream sediments derived from materials high in sandstone and shale. Glenford soils are on terraces in valleys on till plains, lake plains, and outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from  830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in) and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Glenford series is a member of the drainage sequence that includes the well-drained Mentor, somewhat poorly drained Fitchville, poorly drained Sebring, and very poorly drained Luray soils. Chagrin, Lobdell, and Orrville soils are on adjacent flood plains and have lower silt content. Caneadea and Canadice soils are on adjacent lacustrine areas and have higher clay content. Wheeling, Chili, Bogart, and Jimtown soils are on nearby gravelly outwash. Nearby upland soils derived from till include Wooster, Rittman, Ellsworth, and Pierpont soils and members of their drainage sequences."

    "content": "REMARKS: This 2015 revision reflects taxonomic classification updates of the 12th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is anticipated that the Glenford soils correlated in MLRAs other than those in Region R may be recorrelated as new series in future MLRA update activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (Ap and BA horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - from a depth of 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\n3. Aquic conditions - from a depth of 43 to 152 cm (17 to 60 in) (Bt1, Bt2, BC and C horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Glenford series can be found at the NCSS KSSL Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
