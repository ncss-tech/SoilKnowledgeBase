Gravel content, which consists mainly of weathered sandstone fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, sand or the mucky analogues of these textures.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 1 to 3. It is sand or coarse sand.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5YR to 10YR, values of 3 to 7, chroma of 2 to 8. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Train, Deerton, Jeske, and Trout Bay soils. These soils are in a drainage catena with the Gongeau soils. Deerton soils are moderately deep, well drained and are on knolls, ridges and on shoulders of seepy bedrock sideslopes. Au Train soils are shallow, moderately well drained soils on summits and low knolls, and on backslopes of seepy bedrock sideslopes. Jeske soils are shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils on summits and on footslopes and toe slopes of seepy bedrock sideslopes. Trout Bay soils are very poorly drained organic soils over bedrock and are on landscape positions similar to the Gongeau soils."

The depth to perched representative wet soil moisture status ranges from the surface to 30 centimeters below the surface at times during the period from October to May. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high and very high in horizons above the bedrock, moderately high in the Cr horizon, and very low in the bedrock. Surface runoff is very low."
