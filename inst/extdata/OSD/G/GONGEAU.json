  "OVERVIEW": "The Gongeau series consists of shallow, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are in depressions, drainageways and on seepy sideslopes of sandstone benches. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high and very high above the bedrock, moderately high in the Cr horizon, and very low in the bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

It is silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, sand or the mucky analogues of these textures.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 1 to 3.

Deerton soils are moderately deep, well drained and are on knolls, ridges and on shoulders of seepy bedrock sideslopes. Au Train soils are shallow, moderately well drained soils on summits and low knolls, and on backslopes of seepy bedrock sideslopes. Jeske soils are shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils on summits and on footslopes and toe slopes of seepy bedrock sideslopes. Trout Bay soils are very poorly drained organic soils over bedrock and are on landscape positions similar to the Gongeau soils."
