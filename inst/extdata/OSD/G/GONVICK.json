  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 20 to 38 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 2 to 8 percent of the volume of all horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 8 to 16 inches.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  The A horizon typically is neutral, but the range includes slightly acid.  It is loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper part and hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 in the lower part.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has either mottles with chroma of 2 or less or has a matrix with chroma of 2 and mottles of higher chroma.  The Bt horizon averages from 22 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 45 percent sand.  The Bt horizon typically is loam or clay loam.  Reaction typically is neutral, but slightly acid in the upper part and slightly alkaline in the lower part is within the range.  Clay films in the Bt horizon are few to many and faint to prominent and have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 and it commonly has mottles.  It is loam or clay loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 30 percent.\nSome pedons have a C horizon."

The Gonvick soils formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 21 to 25 inches.  Frost-free days range from 100 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet."

Poorly drained Flom soils are in drainageways and nearby flats.  Very poorly drained Parnell and Quam soils are in depressions.  Those soils are members of a drainage sequence with Gonvick soils.  The very poorly drained Cathro and Seelyeville soils are organic soils in depressions.  Waukon soils do not have mollic epipedons and do not have mottles in the B horizons."
