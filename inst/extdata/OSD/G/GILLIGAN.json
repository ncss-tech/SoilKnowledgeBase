These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The control section averages 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser sand and 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe B horizon has hues of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5 Y or 2.5Y.  Texture is very channery or extremely channery sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 40 to 65 percent."

Tethrick soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days, are slightly acid and have 5 to 20 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Ulricher, Vader and Yelm soils are loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the B horizon and have more than 30 percent fine sand and coarser material in the control section.  In addition, the Ulricher soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days."
