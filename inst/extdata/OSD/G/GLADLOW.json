  "OVERVIEW": "The Gladlow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium derived from shale.  These soils are on mountain slopes and mesas.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
