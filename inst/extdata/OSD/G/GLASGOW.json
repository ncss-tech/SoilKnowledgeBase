  "OVERVIEW": "The Glasgow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic tuff with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 inches.",

The soil is dry throughout from about June through October.  The soil is above 41 degrees F from about April through October.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or clay loam with 15 to 40 percent clay.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or clay loam, averaging 35 to 55 percent clay.  It has moderate and strong prismatic structure parting to weak and moderate subangular blocky.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay, averaging 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is weakly to strongly effervescent.   It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nA 2Crk or 2Ck horizon up to 12 inches thick occurs over the bedrock in some pedons.  It is loam or clay loam averaging 20 to 35 percent clay."

Oppio soils lack secondary lime and the influence of volcanic ash on the surface.  Risley soils have a paralithic contact at depths between 20 and 30 inches.  Trunk soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon."
