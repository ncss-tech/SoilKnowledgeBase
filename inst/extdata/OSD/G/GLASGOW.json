The soil is dry throughout from about June through October.  The soil is above 41 degrees F from about April through October.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or clay loam with 15 to 40 percent clay.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or clay loam, averaging 35 to 55 percent clay.  It has moderate and strong prismatic structure parting to weak and moderate subangular blocky.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay, averaging 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is weakly to strongly effervescent.

Oppio soils lack secondary lime and the influence of volcanic ash on the surface.  Risley soils have a paralithic contact at depths between 20 and 30 inches.  Trunk soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic tuff with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 90 to 145 days."
