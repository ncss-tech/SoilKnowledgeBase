  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Guamani soils are on river flood plains of southern Puerto Rico.  They formed in medium-textured sediments over sand, pebbles, and cobbles derived from volcanic and limestone rocks.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 80 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Aguirre, Arenales, Fraternidad, San Anton, and Vayas soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Aguirre and moderately well drained Fraternidad soils are on higher positions and have clayey, smectitic control sections.  Arenales soils are on similar positions, have sandy control sections, and lack cambic horizons.  San Anton soils are on slightly higher positions, have mollic epipedons, and fine-loamy subsoils.  The poorly drained Vayas soils are on lower positions and have clayey subsoils."
