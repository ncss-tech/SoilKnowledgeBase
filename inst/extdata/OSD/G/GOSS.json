  "OVERVIEW": "The Goss series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite and some interbedded shale.  These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.",
