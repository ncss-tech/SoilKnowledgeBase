    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is 5 to 35 percent soft pebble and cobble-size weathered tuff or tuffaceous breccia fragments in the upper part, 60 to 90 percent in the lower part and the weighted average is 15 to 55 percent.  Hard rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent and are colluvial in origin.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Weathered pararock fragments average from 5 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 8 dry; and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry.  The pararock fragments comprise 60 to 90 percent of the volume and varies greatly in color from pedon to pedon, and can be multicolored in a single pedon.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bohannon, Hembre, Kinney, and Preacher series.  Similar soils in other families are Arta, Astoria, Boistfort, Copalis, Formader, Hoquiam, Ilwaco, Jimbo, Knappton, Lebam, Makah, Mopang, Nael, Newskah, Oyhut, Palix, Papac, Silcox, Skamo, Vesta, Walville, Willapa, and Zyzyl series.  Bohannon soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact.  Hembre soils are 40 to more than 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Kinney soils contain more hard rock fragments. Preacher soils have commonly less than 20 percent soft sandstone fragments in the solum.  All of these series except the Formader, Narel, Palix, Walville, and Zyzyl soils have less than 15 percent soft rock fragments in the particle-size control section (PSCS). Formader soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Palix, Narel, and Zyzyl soils have more than 4 percent organic carbon throughout the upper 1/3 of the particle-size control section.  Walville soils are more than 35 percent soft breccia fragments in all parts of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gobar soils are on benches, mountain slopes, and broad ridgetops at elevations of 500 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent, and are highly dissected by dendritic or parallel drainageways.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly weathered tuff and tuffaceous breccia of Eocene age with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  The climate is marine and characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters,  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches, mostly as rainfall.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 175 to 200 days."

Cinebar and Newaukum soils have a bulk density of less than 0.85 g/cc in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Mulholland soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine argillic horizon.  Pheeney soils are medial-skeletal, 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact, and are frigid.  Siouxon soils are medial-skeletal.  Xeno soils are frigid."
