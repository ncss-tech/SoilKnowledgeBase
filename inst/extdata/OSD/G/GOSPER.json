  "OVERVIEW": "The Gosper series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium on high bottom lands or low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches at the type location.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 42 inches, and depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  Up to 0.2 percent soluble salts are present in the lower B horizon and upper C horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is commonly loam and less commonly silt loam or fine sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 with the darker colors in the upper part.  It typically is loam or sandy clay loam and less commonly fine sandy loam.  Clay ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  It ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nA BC horizon is present in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Above a depth of about 40 inches the texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Below this depth the texture is more sandy with loamy sand, sand, and coarse sand being typical.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Glenham and Houdek soils typically have more clay in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizon and firmer consistence having formed in glacial till, and in addition, the Glenham soils typically have a thinner solum.  Ree soils typically have more clay in the argillic horizon and less sand in the C horizon.  Wewela soils have more clay in the lower part of the 10- to 40- inch section and are over shale.  Wineg soils have a drier climate."

In addition, Cozad soils are slightly higher in the landscape, Hord soils hve mollic colors greater than 20 inches thick, and Rusco soils are in depressions or basins.  Silver Creek soils are in the fine family and have a natric horizon and occur on similar landscapes."
