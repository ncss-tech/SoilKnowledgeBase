Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)\nA--0 to 4 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 10 to 20 inches. The solum is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Hue is 5YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly clay loam with 27 to 30 percent clay.  It has 30 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, or extremely cobbly clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay.  It has 40 to 60 percent gravel and 20 to 30 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentinized peridotite and other serpentinized rock types.  Elevations are 400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 120 to 210 days."

This is based on laboratory data from the associated Redflat soil.\nParticle-size control section - from 10 to 17 inches (lower part of Bw1 and the Bw2 horizons)\nAlso qualifies as Dystric subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
