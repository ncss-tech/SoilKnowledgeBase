    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Canest, Chen, and Douhide series.\nCanest soils are 13 to 25 cm deep to lithic contacts and horizon textures are dominated by cobbles.  Chen soils have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons and the mollic epipedon includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Douhide soils have predominantly prismatic structure and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Graley soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They typically occur on all slope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks including quartzite, argillite, andesite, shale, slate, chert, and rhyolite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,780 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
