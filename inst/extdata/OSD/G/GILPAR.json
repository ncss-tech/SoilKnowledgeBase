The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 25 to 45 consecutive days during summer. The solum is 26 to 40 inches thick. The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, phosphorus retention of 40 to 60 percent, 15-bar water retention of 10 to 12 percent for air dried samples, and 35 to 70 percent angular rock fragments. Thickness of spodic horizon ranges from 11 to 20 inches\nThe E horizon is very stony ashy sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, or ashy loamy sand.\nThe Bs horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is gravelly ashy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam, extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam, very channery ashy sandy loam, very cobbly ashy sandy loam or extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kachess (T), Polallie (T), Ronsel (T), Thetis (T), Vabus and Waptus (T) series. Kachess soils are dominated by rounded rock fragments of mixed lithology and have a spodic horizon 1 to 4 inches thick. Polallie soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic sandstone. Ronsel soils have a solum 8 to 26 inches thick, a spodic horizon 4 to 8 inches thick, and are dominated by rounded rock fragments high in sepentinized basalt. Waptus soils are 20 to 40 inches to densic materials and have a spodic horiozn 1 to 3 inches thick. Thetis soils are dominated by rounded rock fragments of mixed lithiology. Vabus soils have dense glacial till at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gilpar soils are on mountain side slopes, ridges and toe slopes. Sopes are 5 to 90 percent. They formed in colluvium from andesite, rhyolite, basalt, pyroclastic rocks, and gneiss and schist with admixture of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,100 to 5,800 feet. The soils are in a marine-influenced climate with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 120 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 61 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 35 to 85 days."
