  "OVERVIEW": "The Granhogany series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Granhogany soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",

Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,100 to 2,600 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 750 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
