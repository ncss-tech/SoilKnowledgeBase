  "REVDATE": "07/2007",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glendorado series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains. These soils have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm.",

The series control section averages less than 10 percent rock fragments, but some pedons have thin strata with as much as 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Bw horizon typically have faint to prominent redox features. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand or coarse sand. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."
