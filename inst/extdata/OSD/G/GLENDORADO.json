The series control section averages less than 10 percent rock fragments, but some pedons have thin strata with as much as 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Bw horizon typically have faint to prominent redox features. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand or coarse sand. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

The Glendorado soil formed in Des Moines Lobe sandy outwash of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 to 865 mm. Frost-free days range from 120 to 180. Elevation above sea level ranges from 245 to 455 meters."
