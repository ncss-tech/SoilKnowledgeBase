  "OVERVIEW": "The Gallup series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, unconsolidated glacial till, and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone and metasedimentary rocks.  Gallup soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and have slopes of 15 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
