The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, unconsolidated glacial till, and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and metasedimentary rocks.  Gallup soils are in a cold marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.   Snow cover lasts from October through June.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 110 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 85 to 130 days."
