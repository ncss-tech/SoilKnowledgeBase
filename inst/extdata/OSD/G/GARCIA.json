The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick and is always one-third of the total soil depth.  It averages 2 to 5 percent organic carbon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 to 59 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 1 and moist in all parts from November 1 to May 15 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2 or 3/2.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 70 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/4 or 4/6.  It is loam, gravelly loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam.   Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 10 to 30 percent.    Base saturation (sum) ranges from 65 to 90 percent."
