  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is more than 16 inches thick and includes the A horizon and all or part of the Bt horizon. Some pedons have Ab horizons.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  Chroma of 1 is allowed in the lower part.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, or clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bw or Btk horizon.  The Bt horizon averages between 35 and 45 percent clay.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon below depths of 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, and value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.  It commonly contains less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent which is disseminated and in masses.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Soft bedrock is below 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fughes, Hillery, Kubler, Pagoda, Zeeland and Zoltay series as previously classified.  Fughes and Hillery soils do not have horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation within about 60 inches.  In addition, Hillery soils have greater than 50 percent clay in the control section.  Kubler soils have color hues of 7.5YR and redder.  Pagoda soils have a moisture control section that usually is dry from May 15 to June 15.  Zoltay soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grail soils are on level to strongly sloping terraces, fans, slightly concave swales and foot slopes on uplands.  Slope gradients typically are 1 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in local alluvium from soft siltstone or shale.  Mean annual air temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches."

Amor, Morton, Regent, Sen and Vebar soils are on adjacent convex slopes on uplands.  They are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Arnegard, Belfield, Daglum, Lawther and Rhoades soils are on similar positions as Grail soils.  Arnegard soils are fine-loamy.  Belfield, Daglum and Rhoades soils have natric horizons.  Lawther soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Cabba soils are on steeper, adjacent, convex slopes on uplands.  They are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Farland and Savage soils typically are on terraces.   Farland soils are fine-silty.  Savage soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick."
