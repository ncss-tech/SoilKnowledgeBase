Slopes are dominantly 1 to 25 percent, but range from 0 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 400 to 2600 feet.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."
