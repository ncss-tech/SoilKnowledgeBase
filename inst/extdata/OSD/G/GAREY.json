  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils between depths of about 8 to 24 inches usually are dry all of the time from May until November or early December and are moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  Rock fragments are less than 1 percent of the whole soil.\nThe A1 horizon is grayish brown to pale brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/3, 6/2, 6/3). It is usually sandy loam, through loamy sand and loamy fine sand are included.  Organic matter content in the upper to strongly acid.  The boundary between the A and Bt horizons is marked by a clear or abrupt increase in dry consistence and increased bulk density.  Other properties are gradual or there are transitional horizons.\nThe matrix of the Bt horizon is pinkish gray to pale brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/4; 7.5YR 7/2, 6/2, 6/4). It is sandy loam, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  This horizon is neutral to strongly acid and the percent base saturation ranges from 75 to 90.  It has bulk density of about 1.7 to 1.8.  Lamellae are present in the Bt horizon.  These are brown, dark brown, dark reddish brown or reddish brown and have a redder hue than the matrix.  The lamellae are one grade harder when dry than the matrix and one grade more sticky when wet.  Commonly they are somewhat brittle when dry.  Clay films as bridges are thin to moderately thick or heavy fine sandy loam.  Individual lamellae are 1/4 to 2 inches thick and in some pedons merge together in the upper 4 to 7 inches of the Bt horizon.  The boundary of the lamellae become more diffuse and the occurrence of the lamellae less frequent with increasing depth.  The aggregate thickness of lamellae of heavy sandy loam or heavy fine sandy loam is about 4 to 9 inches.\nThe C horizon is pale in color and is a light loamy sand or sand.  Indistinct lamellae of loamy sand are present."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Atwater, Betteravia, Greenfield, Marine, Oceano, and Tangair series.  Atwater and Greenfield soils have an argillic horizon that is continuous vertically.  Betteravia soils have silica cementation in a weak hardpan above the argillic horizon.  Marina and Oceano soils are sandy throughout and the lamellae in these soils are too few and too thin to qualify as an argillic horizon.  Tangair soils have brittle reddish nodules and are seasonally saturated above a depth of 40 inches."

The soils formed in coarse textured eolian deposits high in feldspar.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with cool rainless summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The average January temperature is about 50 degrees F., average July temperature is about 63 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 60 degrees F.

Baywood, Linne, and Sorrento soils have mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons.  Lockwood soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Rincon soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Shedd soils are members of the fine-silty family and have a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches."
