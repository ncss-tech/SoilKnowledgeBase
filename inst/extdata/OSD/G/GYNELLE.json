  "REVDATE": "05/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gynelle series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Gynelle soils are on inset fans, alluvial flats, fan piedmonts, fan skirts, alluvial fans and alluvial plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
