Averages loamy coarse sand or coarse sand, or loamy sand.\nRock fragments:  Average 35 to 60 percent mainly gravel, individual strata may have up to 80 percent rock fragments with 40 percent cobbles and stones.\nSalinity:  Average 4 to 8 millimhos/cm.\nStructure:  Massive, single grained or weak subangular blocky.\nConsistence: Loose to slightly hard dry, loose or very friable moist or is loose, nonsticky or slightly sticky, nonplastic or slightly plastic.\nOther features:  Horizons are stratified.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in mixed alluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite and minor amounts of basalt and granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The climate is cool and arid. The mean annual temperature of 11 to 13 degrees C, the mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 mm, and the average frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
