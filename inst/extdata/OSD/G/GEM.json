  "OVERVIEW": "The Gem series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt or other basic igneous rocks.  Gem soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees.",
