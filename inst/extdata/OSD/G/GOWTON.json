    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 22 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizons are black (10YR 2/1), very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2), and yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) in the lower part.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam and reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has color and texture similar to the A horizons or is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), or brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4).  In some pedons there are grayish or brownish mottles below a depth of 30 inches.  The C horizon has thin strata of fine sandy loam in most pedons.  Some pedons are calcareous in the lower part of the C horizon.  The C horizon ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline."

Arrington and Verdigris soils have a fine-silty control section.  Bippus, Bosque, Fife, Gageby, Gowen, and Kaski soils are dry for larger periods of time.  Cannon soils contain 15 to 30 percent of coarse fragments in all horizons.  Staser soils contain flakes of mica throughout."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 72 degrees F; average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches; Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 64 to 80.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 800 feet."
