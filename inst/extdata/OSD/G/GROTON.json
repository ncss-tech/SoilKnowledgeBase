  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 36 inches.  Gravel or gravel and cobbles range from 20 to 60 percent in the solum and from 25 to 70 percent in individual layers of the C horizon.  Typically, 60 percent or more of the fragments are rounded pebbles.  The soil is moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum, moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the solum and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  The soil is calcareous within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A or Ap horizon is dominantly sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction, but ranges to loam.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Fine earth texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the upper part and sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the lower part.  Fine sandy loam or sandy loam texture extends to a depth of 12 to 24 inches.  A few pedons have a thin layer of loam in the upper part of the horizon.  The loamy subhorizons have weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure and the sandy subhorizons are single grain or have weak granular structure.  Consistence is friable, very friable or loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Color is typically a composite cast of individual sand grains.  Texture of individual layers ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine earth.  Many pedons have weathered limestone fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Groton soils are nearly level to very steep soils on terraces, outwash plains, kames, eskers and moraines.  Slope range from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in stratified sand and gravel deposits derived mainly from limestone, gneiss and schist.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 50 inches and the growing season is 120 to 180 days."

The moderately well drained Hero, somewhat poorly and poorly drained Fredon and very poorly drained Halsey soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Amenia, Dover, Farmington, Georgia, Kendaia, Nellis, Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils, all of which formed in lime-bearing glacial till, are on nearby hills.  Hadley and Winooski soils are on floodplains.  Howard and Palmyra soils are finer textured, better developed soils on nearby terraces."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas are cleared for use as cropland including hay and pasture.  Common crops are silage corn and grass-legume hay.  Many areas are used as woodland.  Common trees are red, white and black oak, sugar maple, beech, white pine, cedar, red pine and gray birch.  A few areas are in community development.  Gravel is commonly excavated from areas of these soils."
