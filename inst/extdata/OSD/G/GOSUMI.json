  "OVERVIEW": "The Gosumi series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Gosumi soils are on shoulders and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
