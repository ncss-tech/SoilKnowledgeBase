  "OVERVIEW": "The Gralic series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from metavolcanic rocks. Gralic soils are on side slopes of mountains. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
