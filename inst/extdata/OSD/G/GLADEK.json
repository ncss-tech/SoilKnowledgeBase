Carroll, Myrtle, Nassett, Newhouse, Shelbyville, Watkins, and Waubeek series.  Ashton, Festina, Juda, Myrtle, Watkins, and Waubeek soils do not allow free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Ashton soils have hue redder than 10YR in the B horizon and are formed in alluvial sediments.  Batavia, Downs, Knox, and Mt. Carroll soils formed in loess.  Bowes soils have greater than 5 percent coarse materials and 90 percent sand in the lower 1/4 of the control section.  Frankville, Massbach, and Nassett soils have a lithic or paralithic contact in the lower part of the series control section.  Harvard soils have 10 to 15 percent coarse fragments by volume in the lower part of the series control section.  Luana soils have lithic contact within 40 inches.  Myrtle soils formed partly in paleosols.  Mt. Carroll soils have less than 15 percent sand in the Bt horizon.  Newhouse soils have subhorizons with as much as 60 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Shelbyville soils contain more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gladek soils are on convex summits and backslopes of lake plains and moraines.  Slope gradients range from 6 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediments of Wisconsin age.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches.  Frost-free days range from 124 to 165.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1100 feet."
