  "OVERVIEW": "The Gladek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on lake plains and ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 6 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",

Carroll, Myrtle, Nassett, Newhouse, Shelbyville, Watkins, and Waubeek series.  Ashton, Festina, Juda, Myrtle, Watkins, and Waubeek soils do not allow free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Ashton soils have hue redder than 10YR in the B horizon and are formed in alluvial sediments.  Batavia, Downs, Knox, and Mt. Carroll soils formed in loess.  Bowes soils have greater than 5 percent coarse materials and 90 percent sand in the lower 1/4 of the control section.  Frankville, Massbach, and Nassett soils have a lithic or paralithic contact in the lower part of the series control section.  Harvard soils have 10 to 15 percent coarse fragments by volume in the lower part of the series control section.  Luana soils have lithic contact within 40 inches.  Myrtle soils formed partly in paleosols.  Mt. Carroll soils have less than 15 percent sand in the Bt horizon.  Newhouse soils have subhorizons with as much as 60 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Shelbyville soils contain more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."
