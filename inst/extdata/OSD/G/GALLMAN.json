  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gallman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in poorly sorted outwash with a high content of shale of fine gravel size. These soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, kames, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
