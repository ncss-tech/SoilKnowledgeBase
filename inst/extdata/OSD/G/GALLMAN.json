Amanda, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Hollinger, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Pignut, Senachwine, Strawn, Wawaka, and Wawasee soils are less than 140 cm (55 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Cliftycreek soils have between 35 and 75 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Conestoga, Crouse, Greybrook, Hickory, Martinsville, Ockley, and Richardville soils do not have rock fragments that are dominantly of shale lithology. Kanawha soils formed in alluvium from interbedded shale, siltstone, and sandstone on high bottoms and stream terraces. Mocksville soils are in a wetter climate with a mean annual precipitation of more than 1016 mm (40 inches). Princeton soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Relay soils have hue yellower than 10YR in the Bt horizon. Riddles soils have lamellae in the lower part of the series control section. Skelton soils are more acid than slightly acid in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

They formed in poorly sorted outwash with a high content of fine black shale rock fragments and minor amounts of igneous, metamorphic, and limestone rock fragments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

The Cygnet and Houcktown soils are on the margins of areas of outwash and are underlain by till. Millgrove, Rensselaer, and Westland soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions. Sleeth soils are somewhat poorly drained, have grayer subsoils, and are on lower topographic positions. Thackery soils are moderately well drained and are on slightly lower topographic positions."
