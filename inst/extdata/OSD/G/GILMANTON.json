    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashfield, Beechwood, Fullam, Metacomet and Middlebrook Series.  Ashfield soils have rock fragments that are mainly dark schist and include more very fine sand, silt and clay throughout the profile.  Beechwood soils occur outside region R, have less than 850 mm annual precipitation and lack densic material.  Fullam soils have rock fragments that are mainly channers of phyllite, limestone, slate and shale and include more silt and clay throughout the profile.  Metacomet soils have in the substratum a sandy component that comprises at least 20 percent.  Middlebrook soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have rock fragments that are mostly sandstone, siltstone and shale."

The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping tops of broad ridges and drumlins and on gently sloping to strongly sloping back slopes, foot slopes and toe slopes of drumlins and hills.  The soils formed in glacial till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from granitic and gneissic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 120 to 305 meters.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1250 mm.  The frost-free growing season ranges from 90 to 160 days."

The Metacomet and well drained Henniker soils are on nearby landscapes and have densic materials with a sandy component. Chichester soils lack densic materials and are on valley sides and till plain side slopes and footslopes.  Millsite and Woodstock soils, moderately deep and shallow to bedrock respectively, are on nearby bedrock-controlled landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The Gilmanton series is proposed to recognize frigid Aquic Dystrudepts underlain with loamy densic material.  Previously, these soils were mapped as Aquic Haplorthods.  The Spodosol analogue is the Peru Series.   The mesic analogue is the Woodbridge series.\n2. The series name originates from a town in south-central New Hampshire, north of Concord.  The town was named for the Gilman family, several members of which were land grant recipients in the 18th century.\n3. Reaction data applied to developing the range was limited.\n4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 20 cm (Oi, Oa and A horizons)\nb.  Cambic horizon- the zone from 20 to 61 cm (Bw and BC horizons)\nc.  Aquic feature - redoximorphic features as iron depletions within 60 cm (BC horizon at 46 cm)\nd.  Densic contact at 61 cm.\ne. CEC class is assumed based on comparison of established similar series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
