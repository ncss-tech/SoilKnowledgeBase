Rock fragments content is 2 to 15 percent in the mineral solum and 5 to 30 percent in the substratum and is mainly gravel size.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the mineral solum unless limed.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon, where present, is fibric, hemic or sapric material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 2 or 3 and chroma 2 to 4.  Ap horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 3 or 4 and chroma 2 to 4.  They are 13 to 28 cm thick.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a thin (4 cm or less) discontinuous E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value 4 to 6 and chroma 3 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is typically weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky but in some pedons it is granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.  Redoximorphic features, if present, are few to many, fine or medium, and faint or distinct.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value 4 or 5 and chroma 3 or 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate fine, medium or coarse subangular blocky, or weak or moderate thin to thick platy.  Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic features are few to many, fine to coarse and faint to prominent.\nSome pedons have a friable C layer up to 18 cm thick with color and texture similar to the Cd layer.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value 4 to 6 and chroma 1 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Some have thin (4 cm or less) lenses of loamy sand comprising less than 10 percent by volume.  The layer is massive or has moderate or strong, thin to thick plates.  Consistence is firm, very firm or extremely firm. Redox features are few to many, fine to coarse and faint to prominent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashfield, Beechwood, Fullam, Metacomet and Middlebrook Series.  Ashfield soils have rock fragments that are mainly dark schist and include more very fine sand, silt and clay throughout the profile.  Beechwood soils occur outside region R, have less than 850 mm annual precipitation and lack densic material.  Fullam soils have rock fragments that are mainly channers of phyllite, limestone, slate and shale and include more silt and clay throughout the profile.  Metacomet soils have in the substratum a sandy component that comprises at least 20 percent.  Middlebrook soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have rock fragments that are mostly sandstone, siltstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The nearly level to strongly sloping Gilmanton soils are on glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping tops of broad ridges and drumlins and on gently sloping to strongly sloping back slopes, foot slopes and toe slopes of drumlins and hills.  The soils formed in glacial till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from granitic and gneissic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 120 to 305 meters.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1250 mm.  The frost-free growing season ranges from 90 to 160 days."

The well drained Canterbury soils, somewhat poorly and poorly drained Pillsbury soils, and very poorly drained Peacham soils are in a drainage sequence with Gilmanton soils.  The Metacomet and well drained Henniker soils are on nearby landscapes and have densic materials with a sandy component. Chichester soils lack densic materials and are on valley sides and till plain side slopes and footslopes.  Millsite and Woodstock soils, moderately deep and shallow to bedrock respectively, are on nearby bedrock-controlled landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The Gilmanton series is proposed to recognize frigid Aquic Dystrudepts underlain with loamy densic material.  Previously, these soils were mapped as Aquic Haplorthods.  The Spodosol analogue is the Peru Series.   The mesic analogue is the Woodbridge series.\n2. The series name originates from a town in south-central New Hampshire, north of Concord.  The town was named for the Gilman family, several members of which were land grant recipients in the 18th century.\n3. Reaction data applied to developing the range was limited.\n4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 20 cm (Oi, Oa and A horizons)\nb.  Cambic horizon- the zone from 20 to 61 cm (Bw and BC horizons)\nc.  Aquic feature - redoximorphic features as iron depletions within 60 cm (BC horizon at 46 cm)\nd.  Densic contact at 61 cm.\ne. CEC class is assumed based on comparison of established similar series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
