The soil has a udic moisture regime but is dry between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The depth to the fragipan is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is 15 to 20 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent 2 to 5 millimeter gravel.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent 2 to 3 millimeter gravel.  Below a depth of 24 inches it has few distinct redox features with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Glohm soils are commonly on convex uplands slopes and ridgetops of the Coast Range at elevations of 300 to 1,200 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in eolian material over mixed, old alluvium or residuum.  The soils formed under a cool, moist climate.  Mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F, mean January temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."

Also, Bacona and Vernonia soils are well drained and have an argillic horizon.  Kenusky soils are poorly drained and have a clayey argillic horizon.  Mayger soils are fine-textured.  Trask soils are on steep unstable slopes, are loamy-skeletal, and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."
