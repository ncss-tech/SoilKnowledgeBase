  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages between 50 and 60 percent clay, but individual horizons may range from 35 to 60 percent.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches in thickness. Depth to carbonates is less than 10 inches.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Some pedons are saline.\nThe Oe horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 and 2 or 3 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is a mixture of partially decomposed grass and reeds and some mineral material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, rarely 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1; or is neutral with values of 2 to 4 and 3 or 4 dry.  It typically is silty clay or clay, but some is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The A horizon has a smooth, wavy or irregular tongued boundary into the Cg horizon.  Some pedons have a discontinuous accumulation of carbonates, a few inches to several feet across, underlying the thicker part of the tongues of A horizon.  These accumulations are below depths of 16 inches, or they do not qualify as a calcic horizon.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon. Where present it has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Cg and 2Cg horizons have hue of 5Y, 5GY or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Horizons with chroma of 3 have some distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations  with chroma of 1. The Cg horizon is silty clay or clay.  Some pedons are varved with thin laminations of silt loam or silty clay loam below a depth of 36 inches.  It contains gypsum crystals and segregated carbonates in some pedons.  The 2Cg horizon is clay loam, however it contains coarser-textured materials within depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons do not have a 2Cg horizon."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 23 inches."

Ludden soils are on nearby floodplains.  Barnes, Buse, Hamerly and Vallers soils are on nearby till plains.  Barnes and Buse soils are fine-loamy and are well drained.  Hamerly and Vallers soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches and are fine-loamy.  Bearden and Overly soils are on nearby lake plains on higher elevations.   Both soils are fine-silty.  Dovray soils are on similar depressions on lake plains.  They have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Fargo and Hegne soils are on slightly higher elevations on lake plains.  Fargo soils do not have carbonates to depths of less than 10 inches.  Hegne soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches."

It is at a depth of 1.0 foot above the surface to 1.0 foot below the surface at some time during the period of November through July in the very poorly drained phase.
