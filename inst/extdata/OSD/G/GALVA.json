  "OVERVIEW": "The Galva series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands and loess covered stream terraces. These soils formed in loess. Slope ranges from 0 to l5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters (27 inches).",
