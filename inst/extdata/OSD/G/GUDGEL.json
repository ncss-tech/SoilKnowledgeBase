  "OVERVIEW": "The Gudgel series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from shale and sandstone.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the fragipan.  Slopes range from 6 to 18 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

The Chalfont soils contains more coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum.  The Haubstadt series formed in loess over alluvium and colluvium and do not have bedrock above a depth of 72 inches.  Lawrence soils formed in alluvium or colluvium from limestone, shales, siltstones and sandstone and typically have redder hue in the lower part of the solum.  Pekin soils formed in alluvium, do not have bedrock above a depth of 72 inches and are greater than 24 inches to the fragipan.  Penlaw soils formed in colluvium mainly from limestone and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Robbs soils formed in 4 or more feet of loess and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Rohrersville soils formed in residuum from metabasalt and metaandesite, typically have more olive hues in the solum and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Rossmoyne soils formed in loess and glacial till and contain glacial pebbles in the lower part of the solum.  Sciotoville soils lack a lithologic discontinuity and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Shakamak soils have a thicker solum and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Zanesville soils do not have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and are more acid in the lower part of the solum."
