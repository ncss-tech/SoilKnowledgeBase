Depth to the fragipan ranges from 10 to 14 inches.\nThe Ap has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral depending on liming history.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Btx has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Cr horizon is interbedded soft shale and sandstone with shale being the dominant component.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chalfont, Haubstadt, Lawrence, Pekin, Penlaw, Robbs, Rohrersville, Rossmoyne, Sciotoville, and Shakamak series in the same family and the Zanesville series.  The Chalfont soils contains more coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum.  The Haubstadt series formed in loess over alluvium and colluvium and do not have bedrock above a depth of 72 inches.  Lawrence soils formed in alluvium or colluvium from limestone, shales, siltstones and sandstone and typically have redder hue in the lower part of the solum.  Pekin soils formed in alluvium, do not have bedrock above a depth of 72 inches and are greater than 24 inches to the fragipan.  Penlaw soils formed in colluvium mainly from limestone and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Robbs soils formed in 4 or more feet of loess and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Rohrersville soils formed in residuum from metabasalt and metaandesite, typically have more olive hues in the solum and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Rossmoyne soils formed in loess and glacial till and contain glacial pebbles in the lower part of the solum.  Sciotoville soils lack a lithologic discontinuity and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Shakamak soils have a thicker solum and are more acid in the lower part of the solum.  Zanesville soils do not have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and are more acid in the lower part of the solum."

These soils developed in 24 to 40 inches of loess and the underlying residuum from shale and sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches."
