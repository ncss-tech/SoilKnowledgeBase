  "OVERVIEW": "The Grunney series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Grunney soils are on floodplains and valley bottoms and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
