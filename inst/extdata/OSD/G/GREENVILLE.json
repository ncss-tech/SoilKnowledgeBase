  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except for surface layers that have been limed.  Few quartz pebbles are in some pedons.  Content of ferro-manganese masses and concretions ranges from none to common throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6, or hue of 10R, value of 3, and chroma of 1. It is commonly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand; but includes textures of sandy clay, sandy clay loam, and clay loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 4 to 6.  It is commonly sandy clay loam or sandy loam but ranges to sandy clay or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Some pedons have colors with value of 4 or have mottles in shades of red or brown in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  It is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon contains from 33 to 55 percent sand, 4 to 20 percent silt, and 35 to 55 percent clay.  Many pedons have dark coatings of manganese or organic matter on ped faces in the upper part of the Bt horizon but coatings are generally lacking in the lower part of the Bt horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Davidson series in the same family and the Anniston and Decatur series in related families. Davidson soils are on Piedmont uplands and have less sand in the particle-size control section than Greenville soils.  Anniston and Decatur soils have more than 20 percent silt in their control section, and do not recognize a kandic horizon."

Americus soils have a sandy particle-size control section.  Bama, Lucedale, Orangeburg, and Red Bay soils are fine-loamy.  Faceville soils have an argillic horizon with moist color value of 4 or more.  Lucy and Troup soils have a thick sandy epipedon and a loamy particle-size control section."
