    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 10 inches (A horizon)\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006\nThe classification was reviewed 09/2005 because the classification did not have a mineralogy class Cindery, mixed, mesic Aridic Haplustolls.  The series could be in an Aridic Calciustolls if it has the identifiable secondary carbonates.  The current classification is based on lab data.  Future field investigations should be conducted to ensure proper taxonomic classification.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data are available on this pedon - pedon number 80P0469 (pedon ID number 80NM 003 023) at the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, Nebraska. These lab data support the classification.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 11/81.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
