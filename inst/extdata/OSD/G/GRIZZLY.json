  "OVERVIEW": "The Grizzly series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from igneous rocks on mountains.  They have moderate high or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm.",
