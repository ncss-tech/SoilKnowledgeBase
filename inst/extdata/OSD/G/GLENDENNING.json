The particle-size control section averages from 6 to 17 percent clay and from 55 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser.  The base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and primarily of igneous origin and include no limestone or dolomite fragments.  Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the surface layer and from 5 to 35 percent in the subsoil and substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones range from 0 to 3 throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an O horizon less than 3 inches thick.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nGlendenning soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part of the E/B and B/E horizons has colors like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The E/B and B/E horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.60 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nThe Bt horizon has colors and textures like the B part of the E/B and B/E horizon. Some pedons have pockets, strata, or subhorizons of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. Bulk density ranges from 1.60 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nSome pedons have a BCd horizon with hue of 5YR or 7 .5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.  Clay content averages more than 7 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.  Some pedons have pockets, strata, or subhorizons of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.

The well drained Amery, moderately well drained Haugen, and very poorly drained Capitola soils are in a drainage sequence with Glendenning soils.  Amery and Haugen soils are on more sloping or higher positions. Capitola soils are in depressions or drainageways. The moderately well drained Freeon soils and the somewhat poorly drained Magnor soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a silty mantle 12 to 35 inches thick."
