  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilispie series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium or residuum derived from andesite, ryolite or basalt.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
