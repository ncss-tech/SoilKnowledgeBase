The climate is characterized by cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 270 to 330 days."
