  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The Gaylord soils have mean annual soil temperature of 44 degrees to 46 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature ranging from 55 degrees to 58 degrees F. Thickness of the combined A and mixed B/A horizons ranges from 8 to 19 inches. Depth to calcareous soil is 20 to 30 inches and thickness of the solum is 30 to 60 inches. The amount of fine gravel in the A, B and C horizons does not exceed 5 percent to depths greater than 40 inches. Hue is 2.5Y or 10YR.\nNote: The dark surface (ochric epipedon) is not 1/3 the depth to secondary carbonates.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. The B/A and Bt horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe B/A horizon is marked by moderate to strong blocky structure with patchy clay films in the upper part and with many bleached silt grains thinly to thickly coating the peds.\nThe Bt horizon is heavy silty clay loam or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay and with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has an exchange capacity per 100 grams of clay of 70 to 90 milliequivalents. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nMaximum amount of CaC03 ranges from 8 to 15 percent in the Bk or Ck horizons."
