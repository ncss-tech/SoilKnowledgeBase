  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 61 through 127 centimeters (24 to 50 inches). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters (60 inches). Rock fragments range from 0 through 10 percent by volume in the solum and 0 to 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. The soil is neutral through moderately alkaline throughout. Carbonates are often present in this soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Dry value is 6 or 7. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is commonly weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe AB, where present, has colors and textures similar to the A and B horizons.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is blocky.\nThe BC, where present, has colors and textures similar to the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from silt loam through fine sandy loam. The C horizon is massive, single grain, or it has weak plate like divisions from fine stratification."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Geneseo soils are nearly level soils on floodplains. Slope ranges 0 through 3 percent. The soils formed in post glacial alluvium mainly from areas of siltstone, shale and limestone. In some valleys the silty alluvium overlies lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 79 through 112 centimeters (31 to 44 inches), mean annual air temperature from 7.3 degrees through 9.1 degrees C (45 degrees to 48.4 degrees F), and growing season from 107 through 171 days."

The Ontario soils are on nearby till mantled uplands, the Palmyra soils are on nearby outwash deposits, and the Schoharie and Odessa soils are on nearby glacial lacustrine deposits."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Geneseo series was set up to cover the fine-silty well drained floodplain soils not represented by any other series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n(1.) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 25 centimeters (10 inches) (Ap horizon).\n(2.) Cambic horizon - the zone from 69 to 84 centimeters (27 to 33 inches) (Bw horizon).\n(3.) Oxyaquic - as indicated by high chroma redox features within 100 cm (40 inches).\n(4.) Udic soil moisture regime.\n(5.) Pedon originally described in English units, then converted to metric units.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available through the NSSC lab, sample number S08NY069014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
