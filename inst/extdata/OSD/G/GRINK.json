  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grink soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, and dolomite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,200 to 2,720 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 560 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
