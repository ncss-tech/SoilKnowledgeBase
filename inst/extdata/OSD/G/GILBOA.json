Andres, Aztalan, and Protivin soils have more than 22 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Darroch soils have strata of sandy material in the lower part of the series control section. Francesville and Odell have a densic contact within the series control section. Houstenader soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. La Hogue soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Lahoguess soils are sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the series control section. Le Sueur soils do not have a 2Bt horizon in loamy outwash and are in drier and cooler climates. Marcellon soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the sola. Newhaven soils are deeper than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the sola."

The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 185 days. Elevation is 143 to 277 meters (470 to 910 feet) above mean sea level."
