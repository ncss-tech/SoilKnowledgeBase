Slope gradients are generally less than 1 percent, but range up to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 5 to 20 feet above mean sea level. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 65 to 75 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 55 to 70 inches. Annual frost free days range from 235 to 350."

Cancienne and Mhoon soils are on slightly higher natural levee positions and average less than 18 percent clay throughout the 10 to 40 inch control section.

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is slow. These soils are very slowly permeable in the clayey A and Bssg horizons, and moderately permeable in the loamy 2Bg and 2C horizons. Gramercy soils are wet in the surface layer between 0 and 6 inches, and in the loamy subsoil and substratum layers below the discontinuity during the months of January through April during normal years; and they are moist in the Bg and Bssg horizons. Areas of these soils that are not protected by levees are subject to rare to frequent flooding for brief to long periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Gramercy soils are cultivated to sugarcane, soybeans, cotton, small grains, corn, hay, or pasture. A smaller amount of the total acreage is in bottomland hardwoods. In wooded areas, the overstory generally consists of cherrybark oak, eastern cottonwood, green ash, nuttall oak, sweetgum, American sycamore, elm, water oak, hackberry, pecan, and water hickory."
