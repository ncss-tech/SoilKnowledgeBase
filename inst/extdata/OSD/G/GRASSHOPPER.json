Grangemont soils are on undulating plateaus and are fine-silty. Kauder soils are on undulating plateaus and have a fragipan. Reggear soils are on undulating plateaus, have a fragipan at 20 to 40 inches and have mixed volcanic ash and loess in the epipedon. Riswold soils are on hills and have thick volcanic ash mantles."
