  "OVERVIEW": "The Genats series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils which are moderately deep to shale.  Genats soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale on footslopes and backslopes of plateaus, mesas, structural benches, and escarpments.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",
