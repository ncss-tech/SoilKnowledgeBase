  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenspot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic sources. The Greenspot soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
