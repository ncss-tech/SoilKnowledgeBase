    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the underlying material and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Flakes of mica range from none to common throughout the mineral portion of the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the O, A, and upper Cg horizon, except where surface layers have been limed, and from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the lower Cg and Ab horizons.\nThe Oap or Oa horizon has hue 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4, or hue of N and value of 2 or 3.  The unrubbed fiber content ranges from 2 to 15 percent and rubbed fiber content is less than 5 percent.  Fragments of charcoal, wood, and thin layers or pockets of wood ash are none to common in the organic horizons.\nThe A or AC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4, or has hue of N and value of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, and olive.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 2, or has hue of N and value of 3 to 7.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silt.  Some pedons have thin strata of clay loam or silty clay loam.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, and olive.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

Series in closely related families include Conaby, Hyde, Hydeland, Ponzer, Roper, Scuppernong, Wasda, and Weeksville soils.  Conaby soils are coarse-loamy.  Hyde and Hydeland soils have an umbric epipedon and are fine-silty with argillic horizons.  Ponzer and Scuppernong soils have organic layers more than 16 inches thick.  Roper soils are fine-silty, Wasda soils are fine-loamy, and Weeksville soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gullrock soils are on broad upland flats, in depressions, and on the outer edges of pocosins of the Pamlico surface in the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in loamy and sandy marine and fluvial sediments that are very high in very fine sand.  Elevation is less than 25 feet.  Slopes are 2 percent or less.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from 215 to 250 days, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the areas are cleared, drained, and used for growing corn, soybeans, and wheat.  Native vegetation consists primarily of pine and mixed hardwoods.  Forest overstory species consists primarily of loblolly pine, pond pine, sweetgum, southern baldcypress, water oak, willow oak, yellow-poplar, and red maple.  Understory species include redbay, sweetbay magnolia, switchcane, inkberry, huckleberry, greenbrier, and giant cane."
