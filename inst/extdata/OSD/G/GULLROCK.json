  "STATES": "NC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gullrock series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderate in the organic layers and moderately rapid in the mineral layers.  These soils formed in loamy and sandy marine and fluvial sediments.  They are on broad upland flats, in depressions, and on the outer edge of pocosins in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. near the type location.",

Roper soils are fine-silty, Wasda soils are fine-loamy, and Weeksville soils have an umbric epipedon."
