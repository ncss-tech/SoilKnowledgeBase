  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 40 inches and commonly includes part or all of the Bt horizon. Depth to carbonates ranges from 3 to 40 inches.  Few or common nests of gypsum and other salts are in the Bk horizon above the sand and gravel in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, clay or silty clay loam with an estimated 35 to 50 percent clay content.  The Bt horizon commonly has accumulations of carbonate in the lower part.  Dark coatings of A material commonly are on the faces of peds.  It is hard, or very hard when dry and firm when moist.  Redox features are not present in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Few or common distinct or prominent redox features are in the Bk horizon.  Some pedons have a 2Bk, C or Cg horizons.\nThe 2C horizon of sand and gravel commonly is below depths of 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe 3C horizon of clay loam, loam or silty clay loam commonly is below the sand and gravel between depths of 50 and 60 inches.  Some pedons so not have a 3C horizon.  The 2C and 3C horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Surfaces are plane or slightly concave.  These soils formed in clayey alluvium overlying sand and gravel.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches.  Growing season is about 125 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3400."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope.  Permeability is slow in the solum and rapid in the underlying sand and gravel.  These soils flood for short periods after heavy rainfall.  A seasonal water table is at depths of 0 to 2 feet in the spring of most years."
