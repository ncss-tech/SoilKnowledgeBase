  "OVERVIEW": "The Grat series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on flood plains and in swales or depressions on outwash plains.  Permeability is slow in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Depth to carbonates ranges from 3 to 40 inches.  Few or common nests of gypsum and other salts are in the Bk horizon above the sand and gravel in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, clay or silty clay loam with an estimated 35 to 50 percent clay content.  The Bt horizon commonly has accumulations of carbonate in the lower part.  Dark coatings of A material commonly are on the faces of peds.  It is hard, or very hard when dry and firm when moist.  Redox features are not present in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Few or common distinct or prominent redox features are in the Bk horizon.  Some pedons have a 2Bk, C or Cg horizons.\nThe 2C horizon of sand and gravel commonly is below depths of 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe 3C horizon of clay loam, loam or silty clay loam commonly is below the sand and gravel between depths of 50 and 60 inches.  Some pedons so not have a 3C horizon.  The 2C and 3C horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
