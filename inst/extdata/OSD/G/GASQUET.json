  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gasquet soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 156 to 1148 meters (510 to 3500 feet). The soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized peridotite. The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 2290 to 3050 millimeters (90 to 120 inches). Mean January temperature is 3 degrees C (37 degrees F.), and mean July temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F.). Mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free season is estimated to be about 140 to 180 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: This series was established to identify and map a new family in a survey area that classified soil map unit components only to the family level. Updated to series level for Soil Survey of Humboldt and Del Norte Counties, December 2005.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A reference sample for mineralogy was sent to the Lincoln Laboratory, 1979. Sample No. S79CA015-6. The particle-size distribution and mineralogy were verified by lab data. Additional data is needed regarding organic carbon and moisture and temperature regimes, also data for low CEC (C16 req/100g) for oxidic subgroups or oxisols.\nSource: 10th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
