    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Darfur, Dassel, Goodell, Hanska, Jubilee, Lyles, Monon, Mudgepond, Overshue, Toolesboro, Uniongrove, and Whitepost series. Darfur and Overshue soils are in a climate where the mean annual temperature is less than 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is less than 762 mm (30 inches). Dassel soils have textural stratification in the cambic horizon and are in a climate where the mean annual precipitation is less than 762 mm (30 inches). Goodell and Mudgepond soils have a layer in the lower part of the series control section that has less than 70 percent sand. Hanska and Gilford soils have overlapping soil properties within the series control section and are not clearly differentiated. Jubilee soils contain mica flakes and are in a climate where the mean annual precipitation is less than 762 mm (30 inches). Lyles soils are greater than 102 cm (40 inches) to sand and loamy sand textures. Monon and Toolesboro soils do not have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Uniongrove soils are deeper than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the cambic horizon and have an accumulation of secondary carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Whitepost soils have more than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gilford soils are commonly in broad closed depressions on outwash plains, glacial drainage channels, near-shore zones (relict), and on flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Gilford soils formed in loamy over sandy sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.5 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 210 days. Elevation is 104 to 466 meters (340 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Boyer, Ormas, and Oshtemo soils are on summits and swells of outwash plains or on backslopes of dissected outwash plains. The moderately well drained Branch and Bronson soils are on summits and swells of outwash plains. The somewhat poorly drained Brady and Morocco soils are on nearly level outwash plains. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Granby, Maumee, and Mussey soils are on outwash plains adjacent to the Gilford soils."

In drained areas, the depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 feet) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper part and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part."
