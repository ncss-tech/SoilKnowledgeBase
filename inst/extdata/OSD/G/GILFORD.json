  "OVERVIEW": "The Gilford series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy over sandy sediments on outwash plains, glacial drainage channels, near-shore zones (relict), and flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 988 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.7 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Dassel soils have textural stratification in the cambic horizon and are in a climate where the mean annual precipitation is less than 762 mm (30 inches). Goodell and Mudgepond soils have a layer in the lower part of the series control section that has less than 70 percent sand. Hanska and Gilford soils have overlapping soil properties within the series control section and are not clearly differentiated. Jubilee soils contain mica flakes and are in a climate where the mean annual precipitation is less than 762 mm (30 inches). Lyles soils are greater than 102 cm (40 inches) to sand and loamy sand textures. Monon and Toolesboro soils do not have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Uniongrove soils are deeper than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the cambic horizon and have an accumulation of secondary carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.
