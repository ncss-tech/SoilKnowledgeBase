  "OVERVIEW": "The Gladewater series consists of very deep soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from mudstone. They are somewhat poorly drained and very slowly permeable. These soils occur on broad floodplains of river valleys. The slope range is 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).",

In November, 1992, the classsification was changed to Chromic Endoaquerts and from fine to very-fine particle size family.  In October, 2004, the great group classification was changed from Endoaquerts to Epiaquerts based on saturation studies conducted on similar wet vertisols in MLRA's 131 and 150A.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon).\nRedox depletions with chroma 2 or less: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in)(A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 20 to 211 cm 8 to 83 inches (Bg, Bssg and BCg horizons)\nAquic conditions: 20 to 211 cm (8 to 83 in) (Bg, Bssg and BCg horizons)\nEpisaturation: 20 to 211 cm (8 to 83 in) (Bg, Bssg and BCg horizons)\nRedox concentrations: 20 to 211 cm (8 to 83 in) (Bg, Bssg and BCg horizons)\nSlickensides: 43 to 185 cm (17 to 73 in) (Bssg horizons)"
