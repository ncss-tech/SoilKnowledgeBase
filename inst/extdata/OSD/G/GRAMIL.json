  "OVERVIEW": "The Gramil series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and alluvium over lacustrine sediments. They are on lacustrine terraces. Permeability is very slow and slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
