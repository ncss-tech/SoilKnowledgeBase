  "OVERVIEW": "The Gay series consists of deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines and till floored lake plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
