  "OVERVIEW": "The Georgia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on glaciated uplands. They formed in loamy till. Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow in the substratum. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low or moderately high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 55 percent in individual horizons and the weighted average in the control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Rock fragments consist mainly of weathered limestone, shale, and slate with small amounts of granite. Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to neutral, but ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower solum and substratum of some pedons. Depth to free carbonates is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.

Bomoseen and Minoa soils have an active CEC class. Amenia, Hero, and Hogansburg soils have carbonates within 40 inches of the soil surface. Camillus, Grenville, Lenox, and Nellis soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches and have carbonates within 40 inches of the soil surface.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Georgia soils are nearly level to very steep soils on glaciated uplands. They are on broad plains and on the tops and side slopes of hills, ridges, and knolls. The soils formed in loamy till. The till is derived mainly from weathered limestone, shale, or slate with small amounts of granite. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

The excessively drained very shallow Galoo; well drained shallow Farmington and moderately deep Galway and Lordstown; well drained Stockbridge or Pittsfield; somewhat poorly and poorly drained Massena; and very poorly drained Alden and Lyons soils are in a drainage sequence with Georgia soils. Covington and Kingsbury soils formed in lacustrine clays. Amenia and Nellis soils are calcareous within 40 inches. Stockbridge soils do not have redoximorphic features within 24 inches."
