  "OVERVIEW": "The Golsum series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Golsum soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
