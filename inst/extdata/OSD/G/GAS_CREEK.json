  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F.  Gas Creek soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches, but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches thick.  Mottled cambic horizons of low chroma occur above the 2C horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal 2C horizon ranges from 12 to 25 inches and is shallow enough that on a weighted average basis the control section is sandy-skeletal.  The upper part of the control section is typically gravelly sandy loam and has 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 45 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Textures of loamy fine sand or coarser are excluded from the above range.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the upper part of the control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter and range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The A and C horizons range from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  This horizon usually has common to many medium distinct redoximorphic features from near the surface downward.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, and contains many medium to coarse prominent redoximorphic features of low to high chroma."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gas Creek soils are on floodplains, alluvial fans or concave areas on terraces.  Slope is 0 to 10 percent.  Irrigation has aggravated the typically poorly drained nature of these soils.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials derived from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 7500 to 8300 feet.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 inches.  The frost free period ranges 60 to 75 days."
