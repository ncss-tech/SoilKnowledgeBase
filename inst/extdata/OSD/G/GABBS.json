  "OVERVIEW": "The Gabbs series consists of moderately deep to an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt, ignimbrite, volcanic ash and loess.  Gabbs soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
