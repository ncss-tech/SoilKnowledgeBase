  "OVERVIEW": "The Greenlee series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on benches, fans, and foot slopes in coves in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic, high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as granite, granite gneiss, mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, and schist.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 54 inches.  Slope ranges from 6 to 80 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid unless limed.  Rock fragment content commonly ranges from 35 to 60 percent by volume in the A and B horizons, and 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  In some pedons, rock fragment content may range to as low as 15 percent, but averages more than 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Also, rock fragment content in the A horizon may range to 80 percent in some pedons.  The fragments may be gravel, cobbles, stones, or boulders.  The volume of rock fragments and their dominant size typically increases with depth. Content of flakes of mica ranges from none to common.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where the value and chroma are both 3 or less, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  The A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA or AB horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The BA or AB horizons have the same textural range as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The Bw horizon has the same textural range as the A horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction."

The Berks, Calvin, Dekalb, Lehew, Lippitt, Manlius, Oquaga, Sylco, and Watt soils are less than 40 inches in depth to lithic or paralithic contacts.  Blasdell, Chenango, Tunkhannock, Warwick, and Wyoming were formed in glacial outwash and have stratified C horizons.  Brownsville, Cardiff, Hazleton, and Parker soils have C horizons of saprolite.  Itswoot soils have silt loam and silty clay loam textures and mean annual precipitation of over 130 inches.  Northcove soils formed in colluvium derived from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as quartzite and metasandstone and contain fragments of those rocks.\nNote:  Competing series have not been updated since most of these will also require reclassification using the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996)."

Slopes are commonly 8 to 30 percent but range from 6 to 80 percent.  Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 3,500 feet. The soil formed in colluvial material weathered from felsic to mafic, high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as granite, granite gneiss, mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, and schist.  Mean annual air temperature near the type location is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches."

None of these soils are in a loamy-skeletal family except for Cullasaja soils.  Also, all are in higher positions on ridges and side slopes except for Brevard, Cullasaja, Tuckasegee, Tusquitee soils on colluvial positions and Potomac soils on flood plains.  Brevard, Cowee, Evard, Saluda, and Tate soils have an argillic horizon.  Ashe, Cleveland, Chestnut, Cowee, and Saluda soils are either shallow or moderately deep to bedrock. Cullasaja, Porters, Tuckasegee, and Tusquitee soils have umbric or umbric-like horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was formerly included with the Spivey series. However, Spivey soils have an umbric epipedon, form from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite and slate, and contain fragments of those rocks.\nThe 12/97 revision places the Greenlee series in the coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Dystrochrepts changes the family per the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996).  The CEC activity class placement is based on sample pedon S92-NC-171-002 and placement of similar soils such as Ashe and Cleveland.  Family placement of the sample pedon is siliceous and semiactive, but mixed and semiactive is more consistent with similar soils and other areas where Greenlee is mapped.  Horizon depths and runoff class were also revised at this time.\nThe 2/99 revision updates classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Oe, A and BA horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 28 inches below the surface (BA and Bw horizons).\nLoamy-skeletal feature - The presence of more than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume in the 12 to 42 inch control section (Bw and BC horizons).\nMLRA:  130 \t\t\t\tSIR(s):  NC0173\nRevised: 10/92-RHR-RLM; 1/98-DHK; 2/99-MKC"
