  "OVERVIEW": "The Geghus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from calcareous shale, sandstone, and/or conglomerate. The Geghus soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slope is 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 254 millimeters (10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62 degrees F.).",

Bohna soils have neutral to slightly acid reaction throughout and are 102 to 185 centimeters (40 to 73 inches) deep to a paralithic contact. Chualar soils have no carbonates in the A or B horizons; have 25 to 40 percent coarse or very coarse angular sand in the A and B horizons and have a 2C horizon of gravelly coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Chuloak (MLRA 17) soils have mottles in the lower B or C horizons, lack carbonates and have a C horizon of fine sandy loam or loamy coarse sand. Feethill (MLRA 18), Franciscan (MLRA 15), Nauti (MLRA 20), Shimmon (MLRA 15), Soper (MLRA 15), and Tajea (MLRA 15) soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Flaskan soils (MLRA 14) formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources, occur on alluvial fans and are slightly acid to neutral throughout. Pinto soils have reaction of medium acid to neutral in the solum and a medium acid to strongly acid reaction in the C horizon."
