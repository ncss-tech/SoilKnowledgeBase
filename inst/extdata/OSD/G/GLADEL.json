  "OVERVIEW": "The Gladel series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and eolian material derived from sandstone.  Gladel soils are on mesas and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
