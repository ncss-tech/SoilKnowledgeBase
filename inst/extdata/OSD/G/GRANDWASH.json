  "OVERVIEW": "The Grandwash series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and quartzite.  Slope is 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
