  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodnoe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt mixed with minor amounts of loess. Goodnoe soils are on hillslopes and canyon side slopes. Slopes are 30 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
