    "content": "REMARKS: Galloway soils were previously mapped with the Klej series. Klej soils originally ranged from somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained. The Galloway soils are established to replace the moderately well drained component of Klej soils.  They are in a drainage catena of sandy soils with Klej soils (seasonal high water table at 1.0 to 2.0 feet); Galloway soils (2.0 to 4.0 feet); Runclint soils (4.0 to 6.0 feet); and Evesboro soils (greater than 6.0 feet).\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soils characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions--the zone from 28 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation).\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD(s): NJ0224\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNJ0224 GALLOWAY    0-  5   52- 58  180-215  36- 48    10- 120\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNJ0224 NONE          2.0-4.0  APPARENT DEC-APR  >60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNJ0224  0- 9  LS                      0-  0  95-100  5-12   2-  5\nNJ0224  0- 9  S                       0-  0  95-100  2-10   2-  5\nNJ0224  9-28  LS S                    0-  0  95-100  2-12   1-  3\nNJ0224 28-58  GR-S GR-LS              0-  0  55- 75  2-12   1-  3\nNJ0224 58-727  S LS                   0-  0  85- 95  2-10   1 - 3\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
