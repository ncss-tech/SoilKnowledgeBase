  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gabbvally soils are on hills, plateaus, mesas, and mountains. Gabbvally soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,070 to 2,600 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
