  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Gabbvally series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash. Gabbvally soils are on hills, plateaus, mesas, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
