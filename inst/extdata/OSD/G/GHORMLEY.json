  "OVERVIEW": "The Ghormley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium from basalt and bentonite with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. Thickness of soil with vitrandic properties is 10 to 16 inches. The vitrandic material has estimated bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc, glass content of 20 to 30 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.5 to 1.5 percent, phosphate retention of 15 to 30 percent and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 10 percent for air-dried samples. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 10 to 30 percent and clay ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Depth to an abrupt textural boundary ranges from 16 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizons have value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry. Texture of the A2 horizon and AB horizon (when present) is gravelly ashy loam, cobbly ashy loam, or ashy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BE horizon, when present, is gravelly loam or cobbly loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 1 to 4 moist. Texture is clay, gravelly clay or cobbly clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon below the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in colluvium from basalt mixed with layers of bentonite and small amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 145 to 170 days."
