    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 degrees to 40 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is less than 47 degrees F. These soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days, following summer solstice, throughout the soil moisture control section in normal years.\nThe E and Bs horizons contain more than 30 percent glassy pyroclastic materials. The soils are slightly acid to neutral. Content of coarse fragments ranges from none to 10 percent. The solum is 16 to 22 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, dry value of 6 through 8, dry chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bs horizon has dry value of 6 or 7 and dry chroma of 3 or 4. It is ashy loam, ashy silt loam, or ashy very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR or is neutral, dry value of 7 or 8, dry chroma of 0 through 2. It is sandy loam or loamy sand in the lower part."

Nile soils do not have an albic horizon and are sandy loam throughout the particle-size control section."

The upper part of this soil is believed to be ashy based on laboratory data on the Scar  series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
