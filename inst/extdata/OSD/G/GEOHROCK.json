  "OVERVIEW": "The Geohrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
