  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 12 to 36 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The mean winter soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 53 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sand or fine sand with 5 to 10 percent clay.  Some pedons lack the reddish brown streaks.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sand or fine sand with 3 to 5 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gearhart soils are on long narrow stabilized sand dunes roughly parallel to the Pacific Ocean at elevations of 15 to 200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in eolian sand deposits.  The  climate is cool and wet during the winter and has many days of low cloud and fog cover during the summer.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean January temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The frost-free period is 210 to 300 days."

Frankport and Waldport soils are coarse-textured.  Netarts soils have a spodic horizon. Warrenton soils are in swales between dunes and are poorly drained."

Native vegetation includes Sitka spruce, shore pine, red alder, Scotch-broom, salal, western swordfern, trailing blackberry, European beachgrass, and strawberries.  Many areas have been planted to shore pine."
