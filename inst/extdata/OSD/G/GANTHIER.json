    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 17 to 40 centimeters.   Depth to the Cr ranges from 50 to 96 centimeters. Carbonate clay ranges from 5 to 30 percent in all horizons.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the A, Bw, and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is hard semi-consolidated fractured limestone or siltstone.  Color has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.   It can be excavated with difficulty using hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment."

They formed in residuum from limestone or siltstone in the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA of Haiti. Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent. The average annual air temperature ranges from 27 to 28 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 800 millimeters."

The Dumay (T) soils have a clayey over loamy-skeletal family particle size.  The Sha Sha (T) soils are on similar positions in the landscape but are shallow and have a petrocalcic over gravelly limestone substratum."
