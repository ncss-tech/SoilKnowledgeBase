  "REVDATE": "08/2014",
  "STATES": "HT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ganthier series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on foothills. They formed in residuum from limestone and calcareous siltstone or fine sandstone. They are within MLRA 127, Semiarid Mountains and Valleys.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters. Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent.",

Carbonate clay ranges from 5 to 30 percent in all horizons.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the A, Bw, and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is hard semi-consolidated fractured limestone or siltstone.  Color has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.   It can be excavated with difficulty using hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment."
