Elevation ranges from 1600 to 4500 feet.   Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Bedrock originally proposed as a paralithic contact.  Subsequently correlated as lithic due to textbook hardness of gypsum by Mohs scale.  The lithology is gypsite which is a reprecipitated form of gypsum.  Gypsite is not a single mineral and does disperse during shaking.  Classification is corrected to the original field proposal.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 6 inches (Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL Reference sample S89AZ - 015 - 2\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 5/1997. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
