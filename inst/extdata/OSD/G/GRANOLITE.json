  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Granolite soils are on hills, mountains or pediments.  Slope is 2 to 65 percent.  They formed in slope alluvium, derived dominantly from rhyolite and other acid igneous rock including to a lesser extent hard granitic material.  Elevation ranges from 2000 to 3600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 240 to 260 days."
