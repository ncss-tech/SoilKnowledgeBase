The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and have chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent soft pararock fragments. It is medial loam or medial silt loam. It has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 3 percent and P-retention of 90 to 100 percent.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and has chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay, and has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 35 percent soft pararock fragments. It has 25 to 45 percent clay by field estimates.\nThe Bw2 horizon, and Bw3 horizon when present, have value of 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and have chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 4 through 8 dry.
