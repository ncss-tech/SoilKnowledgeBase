  "OVERVIEW": "The Guam series consists of well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that are very shallow to limestone bedrock. They are on uplifted limestone plateaus, and formed in sediments that overlie porous coralline limestone. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",

Structure:  Granular or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments:  5 to 15 percent cobbles, 10 to 25 percent pebbles.  Reaction:  Neutral or mildly alkaline.\nB horizon - Color:  Dominantly 10R 3/4, 2.5YR 3/6, ranges to 10R 3/6, 2.5YR 3/4, 4/6, 5YR 3/4, 4/6, 4/8.\nTexture:  Gravelly clay loam, gravelly silty clay, gravelly clay, cobbly clay loam.\nStructure:  Granular or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments:  5 to 15 percent cobbles, 10 to 25 percent pebbles.

These soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus, and formed in alluvium and slope alluvium from limestone mixed with volcanic ash, that overlie coralline limestone. Elevation is 30 to 800 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches, most of which falls between June and November. Mean annual temperature is 79 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter."
