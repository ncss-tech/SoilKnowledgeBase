These soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus, and formed in alluvium and slope alluvium from limestone mixed with volcanic ash, that overlie coralline limestone. Elevation is 30 to 800 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches, most of which falls between June and November. Mean annual temperature is 79 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter."
