  "OVERVIEW": "The Grottohill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. The Grottohill soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
