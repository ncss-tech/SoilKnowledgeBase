    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ima (NM+TX), Mallet (AZ) and Perilla (AZ) series. Ima soils are dry in the soil moisture control section from October to May and are formed from sandstone and shale. Mallet and Perilla soils receive significantly larger amounts of precipitation characteristic of the Sonoran Desert (300 to 400 millimeters, 12 to 16 inches of precipitation). Mallet soils also do not have accumulation of secondary carbonates above 75 centimeters (30 inches) and have greater than 1 percent organic matter in the particle size control section."
