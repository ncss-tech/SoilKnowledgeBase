  "OVERVIEW": "The Gull Point series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over loamy till in drainageways and fluted depressions. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part and very slow in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air  temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
