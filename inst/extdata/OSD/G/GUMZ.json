Granby and Maumee soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity with till in the lower part of the series control section. Kentland soils have an organic layer in the middle part of the series control section. Loup soils are in areas that receive less than 762 mm (30 inches) of mean annual precipitation."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately low in the till. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and slow in the till."
