  "OVERVIEW": "The Gumz series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash overlying loamy till on outwash plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
