The depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 25 to 39 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 7.5YR 3/2, of 10YR 3/3 or 3/4, or of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, or 4/4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and is gravelly or very gravelly.  It is 10 to 55 percent by volume spherical solid iron concretions .1 to .8 inches in diameter and 2 to 10 percent by volume subangular iron-coated schist pebbles .4 to 4 inches in diameter.  Reaction in 1:1 water is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has moist color of 10YR 5/4, 5/8, or 6/8, of 2.5Y 4/4, or of 5Y 4/3 or 6/4.  It has few to many distinct mottles of 7.5YR 5/6, of 10YR 5/8, of 5Y 5/1 or 5/2, or 5GY 6/1.  It is silty clay or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  This horizon is 0 to 10 percent by volume spherical solid iron concretions .1 to .4 inches in diameter and 2 to 10 percent subangular iron-coated schist pebbles .4 to 4 inches in diameter.  Pebble content averages less than 15 percent by volume.  Reaction in 1:1 water is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has moist lithochromic color of 5Y 5/1, 5G 6/2, or 5GY 6/1."

Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in weathered green, chlorite or talc schist.  Elevation ranges from 16 to 164 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F., and it does not vary by more than 34 degrees F from month to month.  The mean annual maximum temperature is 88 degrees F.  and the mean annual minimum temperature is 75 degrees F.  The mean annual rainfall is 122 inches and varies from 90 to 149 inches from year to year, with the driest months of February, March, and April averaging 6 inches per month."
