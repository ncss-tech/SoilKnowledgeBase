    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 35 to greater than 60 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the A and E horizons, and very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or N with value of 2 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of  4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2; or N with value of 5 to 7.  Few to common redoximorphic concentrations in shades of yellow or brown occur in this horizon in some pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Ironstone nodules, quartz gravel or weathered phosphatic limestone fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in this horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2; hue 5Y or 5GY, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or N with value of 4 to 7. Redoximorphic concentrations in shades or red, yellow, or brown occur in this horizon in most pedons.  Texture is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Ironstone nodules, quartz gravel, or weathered phosphatic limestone fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in this horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; hue of 5Y or 5GY, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1; or N with value of 4 to 8; with or without redoximorphic concentrations in shades of gray, yellow or brown. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of 5Y or 5GY, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1.   Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Shell fragments range up to 20 percent in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Bodiford and Elloree series are in the same family.  Elloree soils are on flood plains.  Similar series include the Grifton, Meadowbrook, Meggett, Mouzon and Pelham. Meadowbrook soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick. Grifton, Meggett and Mouzon soils have epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Pelham soils are Ultisols."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldhead soils normally are in nearly level landscapes with slopes of 0 to 2 percent but range up to 5 percent in some areas.  They formed in stratified, unconsolidated marine sands and loams.  The mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches."

Nutall soils do not have an arenic epipedon.  Chaires, Leon, and Sapelo soils are Spodosols.  Worthington soils are somewhat poorly drained."

    "section": "DRAINAGE  AND  PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE  AND  PERMEABILITY:   Poorly and very poorly drained.  Runoff is  slow and permeability is rapid in the surface and subsurface horizons and moderate to moderately slow in the subsoil.  A water table is within 12 inches of the surface for long periods from late summer to spring.  Depressions are covered with water for 6 to 9 months in most years."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for forest.  Forest species are mixed stands of slash, loblolly, and longleaf pine, and blackgum with cypress occurring in the wettest places.  The understory consists dominantly of inkberry, waxmyrtle, pineland threeawn, pitcher plants, and bracken fern.  Most cleared areas are used for pasture."
