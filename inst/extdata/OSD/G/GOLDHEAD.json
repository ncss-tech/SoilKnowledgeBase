Similar series include the Grifton, Meadowbrook, Meggett, Mouzon and Pelham. Meadowbrook soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick. Grifton, Meggett and Mouzon soils have epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Pelham soils are Ultisols."

The understory consists dominantly of inkberry, waxmyrtle, pineland threeawn, pitcher plants, and bracken fern.  Most cleared areas are used for pasture."
