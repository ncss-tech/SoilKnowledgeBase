  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Gove soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 50 inches and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizons range from medium acid to neutral.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically coarse sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  A large proportion of the sand fraction is medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand that has a high percentage of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 5YR through 10R.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically coarse sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gove soils are on alluvial fans or valley side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in parent materials weathered residually from reddish brown arkose beds of the Fountain and Lyons formations, or from reddish colored Pikes Peak granite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."
