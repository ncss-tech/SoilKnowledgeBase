  "STATES": "NY,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Galen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy deltaic deposits. They are nearly level or gently sloping soils in lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high through high within the mineral solum and high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Carbonates are at depths of 48 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 8 feet. The soil is typically free of rock fragments but may contain up to 3 percent fine gravel. Unless limed, the soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the Ap horizon and moderately acid through neutral in the Bw and E and Bt. The C horizon ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline. Redoximorphic concentrations are present between the depths of 18 and 30 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam. The Ap horizon has weak or moderate fine granular structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is massive or has very weak or weak granular or subangular blocky structure. It has friable or very friable consistence.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizons has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or fine sandy loam. The horizon is massive or has weak or very weak granular or subangular blocky structure. The E part has loose or very friable consistence.\nThe Bt part, which occurs as lamellae aggregating 6 to 15 inches in thickness, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam or light silt loam, and is slightly sticky or sticky. The horizon is massive or has weak or very weak granular or subangular blocky structure. Bt part has friable or firm consistence.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4, is mainly stratified fine sand and very fine sand but includes thin silty layers in some pedons or loamy till beneath 40 inch depths in others."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Bombay and Mt. Zion series are in the same family. Galen soils contain more sand in the Bt horizon than the Bombay soils, which formed in till. The Mt. Zion soils formed in residuum and are more acid.\nColonie, Elnora, Gotham, Lakin, Lilah, and Spinks are similar soils in related families. Colonie and Lakin soils have lamellae in which the aggregate clay thickness is inadequate to qualify as an argillic horizon. Also, Colonie soils have sandy particle-size control sections. Elnora, Gotham, Lilah, and Spinks soils have sandy particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Galen series occupies nearly level or gently sloping areas associated with sandy deltas and sand mantled till \"islands\" within lacustrine landscape. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils developed in materials dominated by fine and very fine sand of quartz, felspars, and ferromagnesian minerals. The climate is humid and cool-temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches; mean annual air temperature, from 47 to 50 degrees F.; mean growing season, from 140 to 200 days."

Other associated soils are Amboy, Collamer, Colonie, Dunkirk, Elnora, Hudson, Niagara, Madalin, Stafford, Wallington, and Williamson. Amboy Wallington, and Williamson soils, containing fragipans, are in nearby silty glacial lake deposits; Colonie, Elnora, and Stafford soils are on sandy deltaic deposits. Dunkirk, Collamer, and Niagara soils are on associated glacial lake deposits high in silt; Hudson, Rhinebeck, and Madalin soils are on fine textured glacial lake deposits."
