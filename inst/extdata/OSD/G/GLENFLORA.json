    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to the sandy outwash all range from 40 to 60 inches. The weighted average clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy lower subsoil. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 35 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon.  Redoximorphic concentrations are throughout the solum below the A or Ap horizon.  Redoximorphic depletions are 50 percent or more of the matrix or of coatings on faces of peds immediately below the A or Ap horizon and within 20 inches of the surface.  Saturation occurs at or above the surface much of the year in most years.\nThe O horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam.\nGlenflora soils have a glossic horizon (E/Bg or B/Eg horizon, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has colors and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bg horizon with color like the Bt part described above.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.  Some pedons contain thin strata of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nSome pedons have a 3BC horizon (2BC horizon in pedons without a loamy 2BC horizon) with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy 2BC horizon) has color like the 3BC horizon described above. It is typically stratified sand or coarse sand or the gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be very or extremely gravelly. The fine earth fraction averages more than 85 percent sand."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are in woodland. Small areas are used for pastureland, and a few areas, where drained, are used for cropland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Common trees are ash, maple, balsam, aspen, birch, hemlock, and elm. Present vegetation, where the forest cover has been removed, is mostly grasses and sedges with some shrubs, such as alder and willow."
