  "OVERVIEW": "The Grazane series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to shale.  Grazane soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from quartz diorite and shale on risers of fan terraces.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
