  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grazane soils are on risers of fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and residuum derived from interbedded Jurassic shale and sandstone. Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
