    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes all or a part of the argillic horizon.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout.  There is an abrupt increase in clay of 15 to 25 percent between the A and 2Bt horizons.  Base saturation is over 75 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has values of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has 10 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.2 to 0.5 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has values of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel in the horizon just above the bedrock."

They formed in residuum from basalt or tuff with an influence of ash in the surface.  Elevation is 3,300 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 14 to 17 inches.  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Exfo soils are found at lower elevations in exfoliating basalt on steep, south slopes, are very shallow to bedrock, and are sandy-skeletal.  Gwin and Rockly soils are found on steep, south slopes, are loamy-skeletal, and are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Hankins soils are found on rolling plateaus and benches and are very deep or deep to bedrock.  Tolo soils are on north slopes, are ashy over loamy, and are very deep.  Top soils are also on north slopes and are very deep.  Wrightman soils are on plateaus or benches, are fine-loamy, and lack an O horizon."
