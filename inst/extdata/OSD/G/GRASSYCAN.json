  "OVERVIEW": "The Grassycan series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Grassycan soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
