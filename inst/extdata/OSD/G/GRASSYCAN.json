  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grassycan soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed mainly in residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,5700 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
