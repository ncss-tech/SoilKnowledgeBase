The soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon (duff layer).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 15 percent with 3 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders.\nSome pedons have a thin or discontinuous E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent with 3 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 7 percent cobbles and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders."

The Normanna, Soudan and Toimi soils do not have bedrock above a depth of 152 cm and formed entirely in glacial till.  The Wahlsten soils formed in Rainy Lobe till with typical hue of 10YR or 2.5Y in the densic material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on summits and complex slopes of bedrock controlled surfaces. Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent. They formed in friable loamy till from the Superior lobe of the late Wisconsinan glaciation. The till is 51 to 102 cm in thickness and overlies basalt, granite or gabbro bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. The frost free period is 80 to 120. The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters."

The well drained Ahmeek soils occur on shoulders and sideslopes.  The well drained Barto soils have a bedrock contact at depths of 20 to 51 cm.  The poorly drained Canosia soils occur on toeslopes, flats and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Giese soils occur in depressions and swales.  The somewhat poorly drained Hermantown soils occur on footslopes, flats and slight rises on flats.  The well drained Mesaba are on similar landscape but have bedrock at 51 to 102 cm in the profile.  The moderately well drained Normanna soils occur on summits and sideslopes."
