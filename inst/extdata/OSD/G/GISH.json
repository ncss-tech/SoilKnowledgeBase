  "OVERVIEW": "The Gish series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly to very slowly permeable soils that developed in fan alluvium derived from shale. Gish soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides and drainageways. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
