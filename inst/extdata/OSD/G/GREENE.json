  "OVERVIEW": "The Greene series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till over sandstone and siltstone bedrock. These soils are on slight depressional areas on hilltops and benched sideslopes of glacially modified bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent, but dominantly is less than 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 16 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments in the mineral soil range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. Reaction in unlimed areas ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many redoximorphic features. Some pedons have manganese stains and ped faces with chroma of 3 or less. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky or coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to thin or medium platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid or moderately acid. Some pedons have a Bw horizon with chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam. It is massive, with or without plate-like divisions inherited from the weathering bedrock. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2R horizon consists of grayish, brownish, or black colored sandstone, siltstone, or shale. The upper part of the bedrock is fractured in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.\nThe Atherton, Chippewa, Gretor, Morris, Neversink, Norwich, Orpark, Tuller, and Volusia series are similar soils in related families. Atherton, Chippewa, Neversink, Norwich, Morris, and Volusia soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock, and have a fragipan. In addition, Atherton and Neversink soils are poorly and very poorly drained. Norwich and Morris soils also have hue of 5YR or redder in the fragipan. Gretor soils have a frigid temperature regime. Orpark soils have a CEC activity class of semiactive and are underlain by shale. Tuller soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock."
