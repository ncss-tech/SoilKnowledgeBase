  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 16 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments in the mineral soil range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. Reaction in unlimed areas ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many redoximorphic features. Some pedons have manganese stains and ped faces with chroma of 3 or less. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky or coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to thin or medium platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid or moderately acid. Some pedons have a Bw horizon with chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam. It is massive, with or without plate-like divisions inherited from the weathering bedrock. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2R horizon consists of grayish, brownish, or black colored sandstone, siltstone, or shale. The upper part of the bedrock is fractured in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.\nThe Atherton, Chippewa, Gretor, Morris, Neversink, Norwich, Orpark, Tuller, and Volusia series are similar soils in related families. Atherton, Chippewa, Neversink, Norwich, Morris, and Volusia soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock, and have a fragipan. In addition, Atherton and Neversink soils are poorly and very poorly drained. Norwich and Morris soils also have hue of 5YR or redder in the fragipan. Gretor soils have a frigid temperature regime. Orpark soils have a CEC activity class of semiactive and are underlain by shale. Tuller soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Greene soils are dominantly on long, nearly level to sloping and slightly depressional hilltops and benched sideslopes of glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of till overlying sandstone and siltstone. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 45 inches, and the mean annual frost-free season is from 120 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,725 feet above sea level."
