  "OVERVIEW": "The Goosepeak series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
