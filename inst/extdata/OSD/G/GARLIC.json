Depth to upper spodic horizon (Bhs) ranges from 6 to 12 inches, and the thickness of the spodic horizon (Bhs, Bs) ranges from 10 to 21 inches thick. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1, or is neutral and has a value of 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sand or sand.

The well drained Alcona soils formed in stratified sandy and loamy deposits, and the somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soils formed in sandy glacial deposits, is medium sand throughout the profile and has less than 50 percent ortstein in the spodic horizon. The well drained Voelker and the moderately well drained Borgstrom soils formed in sandy outwash overlying loamy glaciolacustrine deposits."
