    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Green Level soils were previously mapped as White Store soils.  White Store soils have a depth to paralithic contact of 40 to 60 inches and have a base saturation of greater than 35 percent above the contact.  In addition, White Store soils do not have redoximorphic features within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.  The 11/2005 revision changed the type location from Chatham County, NC to Wake County, NC and changed the classification from fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Hapludults.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A and E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 51 inches (Bt, Btss, Btssg, and Btg horizons)\nSlickensides--present in the zone from 24 to 41 inches\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nReference particle-size data and laboratory data from typical pedon and supporting pedons (S01NC-183-001-01-011 and S01NC-183-002-01-010) is available from the NSSL, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nData Map Unit ID:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSoil Name    Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip   Elevation\nGreen Level  0-15   57-65   180-260\t   40-55   150-450\nFloodL FloodH   Watertable Kind     Months   Bedrock Hardness\nNONE            1.0-2.5    Perched  NOV-APR  60-60\nDepth  Texture            3-Inch  No-10    Clay%  -CEC-\n0-13   SL FSL L           0-0     95-100    7-20    -\n13-26  C SIC SC           0-0     95-100   35-60    -\n26-51  C SIC SC           0-0     95-100   35-60    -\n51-65  CL SCL SICL        0-0     95-100   27-35    -\n65-97  SL L FSL           0-0     95-100    7-20    -\nDepth   -pH-    O.M.
