    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of about 7 inches (A, BA horizons).  When colors meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon, the horizon is too thin.\nArgillic Horizons - The zone from about 7 to 31 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nBk Horizons - The zone from about 31 to 46 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).\nThis draft changes the classification of this series from Typic to Aridic based on better knowledge of the precipitation and soil moisture patterns in the general area.  Morphology and lab data indicate that these soils have a large increase in clay content at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  The series is reclassified from fine, mixed, mesic Typic Haplustalfs to fine, mixed, mesic Aridic Paleustalfs."
