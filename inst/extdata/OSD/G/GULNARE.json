  "OVERVIEW": "The Gulnare series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  Gulnare soils are on mountain slopes, hills, and ridges. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",
