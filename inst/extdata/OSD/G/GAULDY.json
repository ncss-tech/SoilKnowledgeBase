  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is dry between the depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The thickness of the solum and depth to contrasting texture normally range from 20 to 30 inches but are as thin as 15 inches in some pedons. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is loam and has 15 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel and 3 to 5 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or gravely loam. It has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is extremely gravelly loamy fine sand, extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely gravelly fine sand, extremely cobbly loamy fine sand, extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, extremely cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly fine sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, or loamy fine sand. It has 0 to 10 percent clay and 10 to 85 percent gravel, 0 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones and/or boulders.  The 2C horizon is stratified in some pedons. The soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Gauldy soils are on nearly level to gently undulating flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent. They formed in recent alluvium that had its source in upland soils weathered from siltstone, shale, or basalt. Elevations are 10 to 400 feet. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. Many summer days have a fog or low cloud cover during the mornings. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean July temperature is 61 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 41 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days."
