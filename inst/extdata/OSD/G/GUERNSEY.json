  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 50 inches.  Some pedons have free carbonates at a depth greater than 30 inches. Rock fragments, small flat fragments of sandstone, siltstone, or limestone range from 2 to 15 percent by volume in the Ap horizon, 2 to 25 percent in the Bt horizon, and 2 to 35 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons.  A very stony phase is recognized.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Ap and A horizons commonly are silt loam, but the Ap horizon ranges to silty clay loam.  They commonly are moderately acid to very strongly acid, but the Ap horizon ranges to neutral where limed.\nIn cultivated pedons the E horizon is generally mixed in the Ap.  Undisturbed pedons have an E horizon 3 to 10 inches thick. It is silt loam and is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  Thin subhorizons of 5Y or 5YR and chroma of 1 or 2 in the lower part are permitted.  Iron depletions of low chroma are within the upper 10 inches.  The Bt horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay; or shaly or channery analogues of silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the lower part.  Subhorizons of silt loam are confined to the upper part.  The Bt horizon is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part, and reaction generally increases with increasing depth ranging to mildly alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons have a BC, C, or 2Bt horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam; or their channery or shaly analogues.  It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline and less commonly strongly acid in the upper part.\nBedrock is weathered or thinly bedded clay shale, siltstone or limestone that is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Guernsey soils are dominantly on benches and side slopes on dissected uplands.  Slope gradients commonly are between 8 and 25 percent, but range from 2 to 70 percent, often in complexes with other soils.  In complexes that range to as much as 70 percent slope, Guernsey soils typically occupy benches on the least sloping part of the complex.  Hillside seeps and springs are common in many areas.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded siltstone and shale with occasional layers of limestone.  Slope creep and slippage is common.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 37 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 54 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brookside and Westmore soils and the Elba, Gilpin, Library, Sees, Upshur, Wellston, Westmoreland, Woodsfield, and Woolper soils.  All of these soils except Library and Sees have browner or redder subsoils.  Brookside soils are on colluvial foot slopes.  Westmore soils are on summits and upper side slopes. Elba soils have free carbonates at less than 30 inches and are on summits and side slopes.  Gilpin, Wellston, and Westmoreland soils are more acid and are less clayey.  They are on nearby side slopes and summits (except Westmoreland is more common on benches).  Library soils have grayer subsoils and are on summits and benches.  Sees and Woolper soils have thicker dark colored A horizons and are on colluvial foot slopes.  Upshur and Woodsfield soils formed all or partly in material weathered from red clay shale and are on summits, upper side slopes, and some benches."
