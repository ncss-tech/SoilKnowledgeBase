  "OVERVIEW": "The Goulder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over andesitic lava.  Goulder soils are on mountains and lava plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from mid May to mid November and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early July to early October.   The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid August to mid October (60 to 90 days) and is moist in all parts from mid November to early July.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, on the soil surface, range from 5 to 15 percent.  The mineralogy of this soil is dominated by allophane/imogolite.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; or 5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 2/2; 7.5YR 3/4, 3/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, or 3/4.  Clay content ranges from 9 to 20 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles or gravel range from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral and decreases with depth.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 0.6 to 0.9.  Aluminum plus 1/2 iron ranges from 4 to 5.5 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon color is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4, 7/4; or 5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4; 5YR 3/4, 4/3, or 4/4.  Texture is very gravelly sandy clay loam, very cobbly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam,or very bouldery clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.
