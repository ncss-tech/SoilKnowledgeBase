  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Goodharbor soils are on vegetated beach ridges, beach plains, and stabilized sand dunes adjacent to protected harbors along Lake Michigan. Slope gradients usually are between 4 and 12 percent and range from 1 to 12 percent. The soils formed in sandy eolian and beach deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 812 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."
