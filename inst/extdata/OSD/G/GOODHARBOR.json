  "OVERVIEW": "The Goodharbor series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy eolian and beach deposits on vegetated beach ridges, stabilized low sand dunes, or beach plains near the Great Lakes. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 812 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F).
