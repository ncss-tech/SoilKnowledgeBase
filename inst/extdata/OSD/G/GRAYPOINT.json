The soils range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 6 to 20 inches. Depth to the sandy-skeletal 2C horizon and depth to the base of the argillic horizon range from 10 to 20 inches. Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate accumulation ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 75 percent in a major part of the solum. They dominantly range in size from 1 to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5 YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5 YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Sand coarser than very fine sand ranges from 35 to 70 percent."

The remainder of this document has not been updated. The parent material at the type location is mixed from igneous and metamorphic rock; volcanic rock only makes up 30 percent, JWB, 4/2009. The original concept for the parent material was basalt. In Costilla County, CO the parent material is derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
