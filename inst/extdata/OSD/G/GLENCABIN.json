  "OVERVIEW": "The Glencabin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and  colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rock. Glencabin soils are on buttes and hills. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,320 to 1,835 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
