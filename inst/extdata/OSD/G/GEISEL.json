  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to partially weathered sedimentary rock is 40 to 60 inches.  The lower part of the solum has as much as 15 percent gravel in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts above the Bw horizon for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Cr horizon is variegated siltstone or sandstone in various stages of weathering."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Geisel soils are on mountains in the Coast Range.  They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from weakly consolidated, tuffaceous siltstone and sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The marine climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 80 inches, mean annual temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."
