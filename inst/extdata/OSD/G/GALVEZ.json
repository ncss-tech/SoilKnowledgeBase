    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Loreauville and Patoutville soils are in closely related families.  Loreauville soils have a surface layer that meets all criteria for a mollic epipedon except that it is 6 to 10 inches thick.  Patoutville soils have red iron accumulations in the subsoil, have episaturation, and formed in loess."

Baldwin, Iberia, Schriever, and Thibaut soils are on lower positions on the natural levee, or in backswamp positions, and are clayey throughout the upper part of the solum.  Cancienne soils formed in sediments deposited on younger delta systems and do not have an argillic horizon."
