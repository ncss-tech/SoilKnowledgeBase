    "content": "REMARKS: This is a classification change from fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplustults to fine-loamy, mixed, isomesic Typic Haplustults.  Change is based on soil-moisture temperature data gathered in adjoining soil survey areas.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nThis pedon was sampled by the SCS Riverside Soil Survey Laboratory in 1961. Pedon number is S61 Calif 49-6 and is described in the California SSIR No. 24 Pages 588 and 589.\nDiagnostic horizons and features are as follows:\n1. Ochric epipedon - O to 24 inches (Ap, Al, A2); ranges from 14 to 28 inches thick. Clay content by Riverside Lab is 9.5 in Ap, 12.2 in Al, and 12.5 in A2. Organic matter is 1.48 in Ap, 5.2 in Al and decreases with depth--by Riverside Lab. B.S. is 33 to 38 percent by Riverside Lab.\n2. Argillic horizon - 28 to 73 inches (Bt2, Bt3, Bt4); ranges from 23 to 53 inches thick. B.S. ranges from 22 to 32 percent by Riverside Lab. The textural control section is 28 to 48 inches, or the top 20 inches of the argilllic horizon. Clay content by Riverside Lab was 33.4 percent in the Bt2 28.9 percent in the Bt3, and 21.6 percent in the Bt4.\n3. Mixed mineralogy--U.C. Davis data.\n4. Soil temperature 53 to 58 degrees F--based on soil climate transect in Marin and Mendocino Counties on similar soils under similar vegetation.\n5. Soil moisture in moisture control section.\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\nDry in all parts                          7/15-9/15\nMoist in all parts            1/1---5/1\nSoil is moist in all parts for 214 days and moist in some parts for 300 days.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
