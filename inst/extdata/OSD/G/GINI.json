If not lighter than value of 0 when dry and 4 when moist, the A above the texture B has less than 0.6 percent organic matter if not irrigated or less than 1 percent organic matter if irrigated as an average of the horizon.  The B2 ranges from about 32 to 40 percent in clay.  The ca contains more than 15 percent carbonates."
