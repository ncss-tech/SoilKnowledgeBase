  "OVERVIEW": "The Gini series consists of maximal Desert Soils, formed in medium or moderately fine textured alluvium from dominantly rhyolitic tuff or rhyolitic sources.  The series has an A or Ap, (probably an A2 when not plowed), B, and cca or (and) IICca horizon sequence.  The A or Ap (above the B) have color values greater than 6 dry and 4 moist or have less than 0.6 percent organic matter if not irrigated and less than 1 percent organic matter if irrigated as an average of the horizon.  The B2 is moderately fine textured and strongly to moderately developed.  A strong ca lies below the noncalcareous B2.  The related Mopp series has a weakly developed, medium textured B2, a weak or moderate ca, and is derived from alluvium of mixed sources.  The Bereniceton series is transitional between Desert and Sierozem soils, has no texture B, and is derived from mixed alluvium.  The  Gini series has elevations of about 5,200 feet in an arid continental climate.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 105 to 115 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 7.5 inches and includes 20 inches of snowfall.  The precipitation is fairly evenly distributed, except for a slight maximum in May and June.  The series covers 2 or 3 square miles and is of minor importance agriculturally.",
