  "OVERVIEW": "The Grizzle series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from sandstone and shale on hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

Typically breaks down after prolonged soaking and shaking in water.  Roots can enter the matrix when moist but is root restrictive when dry.  Does not meet the requirements of a densic contact or densic materials.\nGenesis:  Thought to be sediments that were naturally compacted by a combination of paleo lake water loading and impregnation by calcium carbonate and low levels of silica."
