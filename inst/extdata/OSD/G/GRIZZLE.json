Typically breaks down after prolonged soaking and shaking in water.  Roots can enter the matrix when moist but is root restrictive when dry.  Does not meet the requirements of a densic contact or densic materials.\nGenesis:  Thought to be sediments that were naturally compacted by a combination of paleo lake water loading and impregnation by calcium carbonate and low levels of silica."

These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from sandstone and shale.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days."
