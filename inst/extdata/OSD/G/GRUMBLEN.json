Dishner and Pipespring soils are noncalcareous throughout their profile and lack a Btk with secondary carbonates.  Jung soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and rock fragments are dominantly cobbles.  Loomis soils lack Btk horizons, are neutral or slightly alkaline throughout and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. Rocconda soils are 10 to 36 cm to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grumblen soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, andesite, and basalt.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
