  "OVERVIEW": "The Grumblen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Grumblen soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, andesite, and basalt.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
