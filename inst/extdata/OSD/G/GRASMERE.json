The Ab horizon is within 36 inches of the surface.  Reaction\nranges from medium acid to very strongly, except where limed.  The control section averages from 35 to 45 percent clay and has more\nthan 40 percent silt.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent\nin the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3, and chroma\nof 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3, and\nchroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Ab horizon has the same hue, value, and chroma as the Ap\nhorizon.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B1b horizon, where present, and the B2tb horizon have hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through\n8.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."
