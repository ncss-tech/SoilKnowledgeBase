  "STATES": "NM,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenrio series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey alluvium weathered from shales of Triassic and/or Permian age.  These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping footslopes, low ridges and divides.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",
