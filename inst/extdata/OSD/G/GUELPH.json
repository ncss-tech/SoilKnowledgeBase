  "OVERVIEW": "The Guelph series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

Typically, the Hortonville soils have a redder hue in the Bt horizon but the range overlaps. Additional study will be needed to determine if these series can be separated and on what criteria. Waymor soils are deeper than 64 cm (25 inches) to carbonates."
