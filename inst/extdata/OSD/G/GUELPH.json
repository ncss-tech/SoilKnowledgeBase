    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hortonville and Waymor series. The differentiae separating Hortonville series from Guelph series is unclear. Typically, the Hortonville soils have a redder hue in the Bt horizon but the range overlaps. Additional study will be needed to determine if these series can be separated and on what criteria. Waymor soils are deeper than 64 cm (25 inches) to carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent with dominant slopes of 3 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Londo and the poorly drained Parkhill soils are in a drainage sequence with Guelph soils. Marlette soils, which are deeper to carbonates, are in association with Guelph soils in some areas."

The moderately well drained phase has a seasonal high water at depths of 76 to 183 cm (2.5 to 6.0 feet) below the surface between December and April in normal year. Potential for surface runoff is medium to very high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow."
