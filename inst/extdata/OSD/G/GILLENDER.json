  "OVERVIEW": "The Gillender series consists of very shallow, moderately well drained soils on hills with mound and swale microrelief. These soils are in the swales between mounds. Gillender soils formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite or acidic tuff and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 17 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is 560 mm.",

Hadselville and Pentz soils can also develop in mound and swale topography, but form from basic volcaniclastc rocks, and have mollic epipedons. Hadselville soils are in swales and Pentz forms in mounds. Pardee soils form on terrace remnants, eroded fan remnants, and hills from alluvium, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent fragments in the particle size control section. Vleck soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of hills, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."

Whether or not these are redoximorphic features should be investigated as it would be a diagnostic feature and support impaired drainage.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 1987CA067002\nPedon Purpose: Soil survey inventory\nNo certified laboratory data exists for this soil.\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
