    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gillender soils are in swales on hills with mound and swale microrelief.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. These soils have formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite or acidic tuff of the Valley Springs formation. Elevation ranges from 40 to 115 meters. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 430 to 510 mm. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 17 degrees C. The mean July air temperature is about 25 degrees C and the mean January temperature is about 8 degress C. Frost-free period is 340 to 350 days."

Hadselville and Pentz soils can also develop in mound and swale topography, but form from basic volcaniclastc rocks, and have mollic epipedons. Hadselville soils are in swales and Pentz forms in mounds. Pardee soils form on terrace remnants, eroded fan remnants, and hills from alluvium, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent fragments in the particle size control section. Vleck soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of hills, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."

Whether or not these are redoximorphic features should be investigated as it would be a diagnostic feature and support impaired drainage.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 1987CA067002\nPedon Purpose: Soil survey inventory\nNo certified laboratory data exists for this soil.\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
