  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is more than 80 inches thick.  The reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.  The soil is dry in some part of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days in most years.  Rounded ironstone nodules mainly less than one-half inch across range from none to few throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Some pedons have an E horizon with color value 1 or 2 units higher than the A horizon.\nThe EB horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand and the Bt horizon contains at least 3 percent more clay than the horizon above.   Streaks and spots of uncoated sand range from none to about five percent.\nThe Bt and E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.  The texture is fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Streaks and spots of uncoated sand range from few to common.  This horizon is not in all pedons."

The Eustis and Valdosta soils are dry in the moisture control section less than 75 days in most years.  Also, Valdosta soils are restricted to the Hawthorn geologic formation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in material weathered from thick sandy coastal plain sediments.  The elevation is 450 to 550 feet above sea level.  The frost free days ranges from 230 to 240.  The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F., the average annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 46 inches and the Thornwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 70."

Briley, Darco, Lilbert and Tenaha soils have loamy argillic horizons.  Briley soils are on slightly higher convex ridges.  Darco and Lilbert soils are on similar landscapes. Tenaha soils are mainly on lower steeper sloping areas.  Tonkawa soils do not have an argillic horizon.  They are on similar landscapes."
