  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Gellatly soils are on gently sloping to steep side slopes on hills at elevations of 300 to 1,500 feet. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. The soils formed in clayey colluvium and  residuum derived from basalt of the Siletz River Volcanics formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
