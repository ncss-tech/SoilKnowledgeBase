  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is difficult to measure because of the gypsum content, apparent texture is silt loam and loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The coarse material including part of the sand fraction, is composed of gypsum crystals and some alabaster.  This material is unstable and breaks down upon pretreatment.  Coarse fragments of alabaster range from 0 to 5 percent in the upper 35 inches and from 0 to 15 percent in the lower part of the substratum.  Gypsum content is 40 to 60 percent throughout the control section.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from a trace to 14 percent in the gypsic horizon and occurs in an irregular pattern within most horizons.  A water table is present from April through July in most years at 20 to 40 inches.  The moisture control section always feels moist because of the gypsum but available moisture is low and is depleted by mid-August.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam.  The reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe By horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or loam.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."
