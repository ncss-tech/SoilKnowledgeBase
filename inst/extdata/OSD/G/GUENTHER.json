  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 Volume of angular gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy mantle, from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy subsoil, and from 0 to 30 percent in the loamy substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent in loamy material. Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the soil but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Redox accumulations and saturation occur below the spodic horizon and within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4, but has value of 5 in the lower part of most pedons.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nSome Guenther soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizons, or both). The E part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam or loam.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color and texture like the 2B part described above. The 2Bt horizon averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and from 25 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Guenther soils are on uplands underlain by bedrock.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  Guenther soils formed in sandy alluvium and in the underlying loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock, or both.  The till is thought to be derived mainly from the local residuum, but the glacial stratigraphy in the area where these soils occur is not fully worked out.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Point and Rockers and poorly drained Dancy soils are in a drainage sequence with the Guenther soils.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:   Field experience indicates that these soils have some evidence of till overlying the residuum or a mixture of till and residuum in the upper few feet of the lower part of the profile.\n12/2006 - This soil is correlated in 2 surveys. The TUDs in both surveys have redox features within 40 inches. Therefore this revision changes the concept of the soil to moderately well drained only and reclassifies it as Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods.\nThere are 4480 acres correlated in Marathon County. The TUD for Marathon County describes the glossic horizon in the sandy mantle. The sandy mantle in the Marathon TUD is entirely loamy sand and both the B part and the E part of the B/E are loamy sand. It is very doubtful that this is a glossic horizon. Guenther soils in Marathon County need to field checked to see if they have a glossic horizon in the loamy till. In the mean time I have excluded the glossic from the sandy mantle in the OSD and have allowed the glossic to be absent in the loamy till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap, E);\nspodic horizon - 9 to 25 inches (Bs1, Bs2);\nargillic horizon - 30 to 37 inches (2Bt); glossic horizon - 25 to 30 inches (2E/B);\noxyaquic feature - redox accumulations and saturation within a depth of 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
