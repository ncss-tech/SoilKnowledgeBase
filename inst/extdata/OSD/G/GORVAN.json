The poorly drained or very poorly drained Glendora soils are nearer to stream channels or are along more active streams."

Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow over rapid. These soils are subject to frequent flooding from late fall to spring."
