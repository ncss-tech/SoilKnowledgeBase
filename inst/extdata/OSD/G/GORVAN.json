    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gorvan soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in alluvium washed mainly from soils formed in loamy, calcareous drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The excessively drained Plainfield and Coloma soil are in uplands adjacent to the river. The very poorly drained Houghton soils are in old oxbows and stream channels along the river. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Glendora soils are nearer to stream channels or are along more active streams."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table is 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow over rapid. These soils are subject to frequent flooding from late fall to spring."
