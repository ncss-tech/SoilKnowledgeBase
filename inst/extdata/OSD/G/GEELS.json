Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 488 meters (600 to 1,600 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Perecheney soils are common associates on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Allendale soils and the poorly drained Kinross soils are on slightly lower areas and drainageways. The very poorly drained Dawson and Loxley soils are in depressions."
