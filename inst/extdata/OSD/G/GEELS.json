  "OVERVIEW": "The Geels series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains and outwash plains. These soils formed in sandy deposits and the underlying clayey and loamy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
