Prag soils are moderately deep to partially consolidated sediments.  Skullgulch soils have more than 45 percent clay in the Bt horizon and secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greentimber soils are on plains and moraines at elevations of 5300 to 5700 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  They formed in loess mantled glacial drift derived from mixed igneous rocks, mainly rhyolite and basalt.  Greentimber soils have an average annual air temperature of 39 to 43 degrees F and an average annual precipitation of 16 to 22 inches.  The frost-free season is 75 to 85 days."

Marystown soils are intermixed with the Greentimber sols and formed in similar loess mantled glacial deposits.  Kucera, Lostine, and Marystown soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
