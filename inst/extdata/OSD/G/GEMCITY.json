  "OVERVIEW": "The Gemcity series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum of basalt. Gemcity soils are on old basalt capped mesas. Slope is 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
