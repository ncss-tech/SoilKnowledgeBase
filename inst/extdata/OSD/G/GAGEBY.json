  "OVERVIEW": "The Gageby series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on floodplains or draws on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
