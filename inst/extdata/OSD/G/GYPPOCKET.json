  "OVERVIEW": "The Gyppocket series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from sedimentary formations with high gypsum and lime content.  Gyppocket soils are on colluvial slopes and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
