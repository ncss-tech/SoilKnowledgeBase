    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 0.  Distinct or prominent redox features are present.  The lower part of the mollic epipedon can be chroma of 2 if it meets the other requirements to be an aquoll.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cg horizon or C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR, 10YR, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Distinct and prominent redox features of higher chroma range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay, clay or rarely, silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are none. Similar soils are the Egam, Girard, Lanton, Lynnville, Roellen and Staser soils. Egam soils are moderately well drained.  Girard soils are 20 to 40 inches thick over bedrock.  Lanton and Lynnville soils are fine-silty.  Roellen soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick.  Staser soils do not have low chroma mottles immediately below the mollic epipedon and are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Godwin soils are on nearly level flood plains, along drainageways, and in depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium that is medium to high in phosphorus, which washed from soils formed mainly in residuum from phosphatic limestone."
