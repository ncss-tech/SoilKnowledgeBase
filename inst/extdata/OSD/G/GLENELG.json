  "OVERVIEW": "The Glenelg series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from micaceous schist on uplands of the Blue Ridge and the Northern Piedmont. Slopes range from 0 to 55 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and moderately high to high in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the solum and 5 to 55 percent in the C horizon. Fragments are mostly hard white quartzite or schist and range from gravel or channers to stones in size. Stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mica content increases sharply in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Unlimed reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Silt content is close to 50 percent.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction, with silt content close to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon and (BCt where present) has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. The particle-size control section is 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon and (CBt where present) has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It commonly is variegated due to variations in the saprolite. The C horizon is loam, sandy loam or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. In some pedons, the C horizon has silt loam textures in the lower part where veins of quartz remain from weathering processes."

Albemarle, Cardova, Clifftop (T), Drapermill, Gilwood, Milldraper and Ungers soils have bedrock at less than 60 inches.   Allegheny, Ezel, and Meadowville soils lack coarse fragments dominated by mica schist and mica gneiss.  Arendtsville, Eubanks, Frankstown, Leck Kill, Murrill, Nixon, Shouns, and Whiteford soils lack mica flakes.  Allenwood soils are formed in glacial till.  Cades and Elsinboro soils formed on old stream terraces and alluvial fans. Chester soils have an argillic horizon greater than 25 inches. Chetwynd soils formed from unconsolidated outwash sediments.  Happyland soils have a moderately slow to slow hydraulic conductivity in the series control section. Queponco and Reybold soils are found in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain. Rhodhiss and Lonon soils have significantly lower silt content.  Tate soils are formed in colluvium of the southern Blue Ridge."

Airy and Urbana soils. Baile soils are poorly drained and formed from local alluvium over residuum in upland depressions and on footslopes. Brandywine, Manor and Mt. Airy soils do not have a Bt horizon. Codorus, Comus and Hatboro soils formed from recent alluvium on flood plains. Delanco and Kinkora soils formed from alluvium and occur on terraces. Elioak soils have a Bt horizon averaging more than 35 percent clay. Fairfax soils have more clay and formed in alluvium and the underlying residuum. Glenville and Urbana soils have a fragipan. Linganore soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments and have base saturation greater than 35 percent. Chester soils have depths to the base of the argillic ranging from 31 to 55 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2/99 revision places Glenelg soils in an semiactive CEC activity class, but additional data from University of Maryland and NSSL show CEC class of active as well.  Pedons S82MD-031-001 (semiactive) and S56PA-029-002 (active). The depth to the base of the argillic is change from 30 to 35 inches. The upper slope range was also expanded from 50 to 55 percent to facilitate the correlation of Grayson County, Virginia. The type location moved to Howard County, Maryland in 2004 to be more centered within MLRA 148.  7/2007 revisions were for updating competing and geographically associated soils also Ksat.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 6 inches. (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 10 to 30 inches.
