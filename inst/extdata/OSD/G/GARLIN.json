  "BYREV": "Rev. HSE-SJB-DHK-JDM",
  "REVDATE": "02/2006",
  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Garlin series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from interbedded calcareous siltstone, shale, sandstone and limestone. These upland soils are on narrow ridges and side slopes. Slopes range from 4 to about 50 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Rock fragments are primarily siltstone and shale and range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 20 percent in the Bw horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Bw horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown or gray. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam. Low chroma colors, where present, are inherited from the parent rock.\nThe Cr horizon is interbedded calcareous siltstone, shale and limestone. The weathered bedrock is rippable and can be dug with a spade."
