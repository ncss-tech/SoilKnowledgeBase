When described in March 1991 the soil was slightly dry.)\nAp--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots throughout; slightly effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate); slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches)\nBw--6 to 18 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) lithochromic mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots throughout; 10 percent siltstone pebbles; strongly effervescent (55 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Rock fragments are primarily siltstone and shale and range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 20 percent in the Bw horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Bw horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown or gray. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam. Low chroma colors, where present, are inherited from the parent rock.\nThe Cr horizon is interbedded calcareous siltstone, shale and limestone. The weathered bedrock is rippable and can be dug with a spade."

This soil formed in residuum weathered from interbedded calcareous siltstone, shale and sandstone, and limestone. The regolith is commonly called marly shale. The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees Fahrenheit with a mean of 55 degrees. Annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches with a mean of about 45 inches."
