Gerlach soils (MLRA 23), on alluvial fans, are deeper than 60 inches. Horsecamp soils (MLRA 23), are on plateaus, and are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact of hard basalt rock. Manogue soils (MLRA 26), are on hills, plateaus and pediments, are 40 to 80 inches to highly weathered andesite in alluvium and colluvium and have Bkss horizons with a depth to carbonates from 10 to 20 inches. Moroni soils (MLRA 28A), are on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes, and are deeper than 60 inches. Waspo soils (MLRA 10, 26), are on side slopes and pediments formed in mixed pedisediment and residuum weathered from tuff, have 5 to 15 percent tuffaceous gravel and have a frost-free season of about 100 days."
