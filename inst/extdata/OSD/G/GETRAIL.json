  "OVERVIEW": "The Getrail series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains, that have wide cracks when dry. These soils formed in material weathered from clayey shale. Slope is 15 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
