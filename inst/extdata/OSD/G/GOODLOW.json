The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum is 30 to 50 inches. Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in the Bw  horizon and 50 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is estimated to be 1.0 to 1.5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It is loam or silt loam with 10 to 20 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is very cobbly silty clay loam or very cobbly clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 10 to 35 percent gravel, 20 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe C horizon ranges from extremely cobbly loam to very cobbly loam to very stony loam. It has 20 to 45 percent gravel, 20 to 35 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Goodlow soils are on smooth mountain side slopes in the Cascade Mountains. Elevations are 2,800 to 3,600 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The soils formed in moderately fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered from olivine basalt and olivine andesite of the Cascade Andesite Formation with an admixture of soft, reddish tuffaceous rock material. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 700 to 90 inches, falling as rain in the fall and spring, and snow in winter.  Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer. The mean January temperature is 30 degrees F. The mean July temperature is 58 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 10 to 30 days."
