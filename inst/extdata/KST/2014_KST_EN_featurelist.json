    "description": "Soils Most soils are dominantly mineral material, but many mineral soils have horizons of organic material. For simplicity in writing definitions of taxa, a distinction between what is meant by a mineral soil and an organic soil is useful. To apply the definitions of many taxa, one must first decide whether the soil is mineral or organic. An exception is the Andisols (defined later). These generally are considered to consist of mineral soils, but some may be organic if they meet other criteria for Andisols. Those that exceed the organic carbon limit defined for mineral soils have a colloidal fraction dominated by short- range-order minerals or aluminum-humus complexes. The mineral fraction in these soils is believed to give more control to the soil properties than the organic fraction. Therefore, the soils are included with the Andisols rather than the organic soils defined later as Histosols and Histels. If a soil has both organic and mineral horizons, the relative thickness of the organic and mineral soil materials must be considered. At some point one must decide that the mineral horizons are more important. This point is arbitrary and depends in part on the nature of the materials. A thick layer of Sphagnum has a very low bulk density and contains less organic matter than a thinner layer of well-decomposed muck. It is much easier to measure the thickness of layers in the field than it is to determine tons of organic matter per hectare. The definition of a mineral soil, therefore, is based on the thickness of the horizons, or layers, but the limits of thickness must vary with the kinds of materials. The definition that follows is intended to classify as mineral soils those that have both thick mineral soil layers and no more organic material than the amount permitted in the histic epipedon, which is defined in chapter 3. In the determination of whether a soil is organic or mineral, the thickness of horizons is measured from the soil surface (defined below) whether that is a horizon composed of mineral * Mineral soils include all soils except the suborder Histels and the order Histosols. Differentiae for Mineral Soils* and Organic Soils soil material or one composed of organic soil material. This determination is different for buried soils as defined in chapter 1. Thus, any horizon at the surface, designated with capital letter O, is considered an organic horizon if it meets the requirements of organic soil material, and its thickness is added to that of any other organic horizons to determine the total thickness of organic soil material. Plant materials at the soil surface must be at least slightly decomposed to be considered part of an O horizon. Undecomposed plant litter is excluded from the concept of O horizons.",

It is either a soil surface composed of mineral soil material or it is the boundary between a horizon composed of organic soil material and a horizon composed of mineral soil material. The upper boundary of the first horizon, encountered at or below the soil surface that is composed of mineral soil material, is considered the mineral soil surface. For example, a upland mineral soil with an 5-cm-thick Oi horizon within a horizon sequence of Oi-A-E-Bt-C has two surfaces for depth measurements. There is a soil surface at the boundary between either air or undecomposed plant material and the Oi horizon (at a depth of 0 cm).

    "description": "The Epipedon The epipedon (Gr. epi, over, upon, and pedon, soil) is a horizon that forms at or near the surface and in which most of the rock structure has been destroyed. It is darkened by organic matter or shows evidence of eluviation, or both. Rock structure as used here and in other places in this taxonomy includes fine stratification (5 mm or less thick) in unconsolidated sediments (eolian, alluvial, lacustrine, or marine) and saprolite derived from consolidated rocks in which the unweathered minerals and pseudomorphs of weathered minerals retain their relative positions to each other. Any horizon may be at the surface of a truncated soil. The following section, however, is concerned with eight diagnostic horizons that have formed at or near the soil surface. These horizons can be covered by a surface mantle of new soil material. If the surface mantle has rock structure, the top of the epipedon is considered the soil surface unless the mantle meets the definition of buried soils in chapter 1. If the soil includes a buried soil, the epipedon, if any, is at the soil surface and the epipedon of the buried soil is considered a buried epipedon and is not considered in selecting taxa unless the keys specifically indicate buried horizons, such as those in Thapto-Histic subgroups. A soil with a mantle thick enough to have a buried soil has no epipedon if the soil has rock structure to the surface or has an Ap horizon less than 25 cm thick that is underlain by soil material with rock structure. The melanic epipedon (defined below) is unique among epipedons. It commonly forms in deposits of tephra and can receive fresh deposits of volcanic ash. Therefore, this horizon is permitted to have layers within and above the epipedon that are not part of the melanic epipedon. A recent alluvial or eolian deposit that retains fine stratifications (5 mm or less thick) or an Ap horizon directly underlain by such stratified material is not included in the concept of the epipedon because time has not been sufficient for soil-forming processes to erase these transient marks of deposition and for diagnostic and accessory properties to develop. An epipedon is not the same as an A horizon. It may include part or all of an illuvial B horizon if the darkening by organic matter extends from the soil surface into or through the B horizon.",

    "chapter": 3,
    "page": 20,
    "description": "Lithologic discontinuities are significant changes in particle- size distribution or mineralogy that represent differences in lithology within a soil. A lithologic discontinuity can also denote an age difference. For information on using horizon designations for lithologic discontinuities, see the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993) and chapter 18 of this document. Not everyone agrees on the degree of change required for a lithologic discontinuity. No attempt is made to quantify lithologic discontinuities. The discussion below is meant to serve as a guideline. Several lines of field evidence can be used to evaluate lithologic discontinuities. In addition to mineralogical and textural differences that may require laboratory studies, certain observations can be made in the field. These include but are not limited to the following: 1. Abrupt textural contacts.—An abrupt change in particle-size distribution, which is not solely a change in clay content resulting from pedogenesis, can often be observed. 2. Contrasting sand sizes.—Significant changes in sand size can be detected. For example, if material containing mostly medium sand or finer sand abruptly overlies material containing mostly coarse sand and very coarse sand, one can assume that there are two different materials. Although the materials may be of the same mineralogy, the contrasting sand sizes result from differences in energy at the time of deposition by water and/or wind. 3. Bedrock lithology vs. rock fragment lithology in the soil.—If a soil with rock fragments overlies a lithic contact, one would expect the rock fragments to have a lithology similar to that of the material below the lithic contact. If many of the rock fragments do not have the same lithology as the underlying bedrock, the soil is not derived completely from the underlying bedrock. 4. Stone lines.—The occurrence of a horizontal line of rock fragments in the vertical sequence of a soil indicates that the soil may have developed in more than one kind of parent material. The material above the stone line is most likely transported, and the material below may be of different origin. 5. Inverse distribution of rock fragments.—A lithologic discontinuity is often indicated by an erratic distribution of rock fragments. The percentage of rock fragments decreases with increasing depth. This line of evidence is useful in areas of soils that have relatively unweathered rock fragments. 6. Rock fragment weathering rinds.—Horizons containing rock fragments with no rinds that overlie horizons containing rocks with rinds suggest that the upper material is in part depositional and not related to the lower part in time and perhaps in lithology. 7. Shape of rock fragments.—A soil with horizons containing angular rock fragments overlying horizons containing well rounded rock fragments may indicate a discontinuity. This line of evidence represents different mechanisms of transport (colluvial vs. alluvial) or even different transport distances. 8. Soil color.—Abrupt changes in color that are not the result of pedogenic processes can be used as indicators of discontinuity. 9. Micromorphological features.—Marked differences in the size and shape of resistant minerals in one horizon and not in another are indicators of differences in materials. Use of Laboratory Data Discontinuities are not always readily apparent in the field. In these cases laboratory data are necessary. Even with laboratory data, detecting discontinuities may be difficult. The decision is a qualitative or perhaps a partly quantitative judgment. General concepts of lithology as a function of depth might include: 1. Laboratory data—visual scan.—The array of laboratory data is assessed in an attempt to determine if a field- designated discontinuity is corroborated and if any data show evidence of a discontinuity not observed in the field. One must sort changes in lithology from changes caused by pedogenic processes. In most cases the quantities of sand and coarser fractions are not altered significantly by soil-forming processes. Therefore, an abrupt change in sand size or sand mineralogy is a clue to lithologic change. Gross soil mineralogy and the resistant mineral suite are other clues. 2. Data on a clay-free basis.—A common manipulation in assessing lithologic change is computation of sand and silt separates on a carbonate-free, clay-free basis (percent fraction, e.g., fine sand and very fine sand, divided by percent sand plus silt, times 100). Clay distribution is subject to pedogenic change and may either mask inherited lithologic differences or produce differences that are not inherited from lithology. The numerical array computed on a clay-free basis can be inspected visually or plotted as a function of depth. Another aid used to assess lithologic changes is computation of the ratios of one sand separate to another. The ratios can be computed and examined as a numerical array, or they can be plotted. The ratios work well if sufficient quantities of the two fractions are available. Low quantities magnify changes in ratios, especially if the denominator is low.",

    "description": "The n value (Pons and Zonneveld, 1965) characterizes the relation between the percentage of water in a soil under field conditions and its percentages of inorganic clay and humus. The n value is helpful in predicting whether a soil can be grazed by livestock or can support other loads and in predicting what degree of subsidence would occur after drainage. For mineral soil materials that are not thixotropic, the n value can be calculated by the following formula: n = (A - 0.2R)/(L + 3H) In this formula, A is the percentage of water in the soil in field condition, calculated on a dry-soil basis; R is the percentage of silt plus sand; L is the percentage of clay; and H is the percentage of organic matter (percent organic carbon multiplied by 1.724). Few data for calculations of the n value are available in the United States, but the critical n value of 0.7 can be approximated closely in the field by a simple test of squeezing a soil sample in the palm of a hand. If the soil flows between the fingers with difficulty, the n value is between 0.7 and 1.0 (slightly fluid manner of failure class); if the soil flows easily between the fingers, the n value is 1 or more (moderately fluid or very fluid manner of failure class); and if no soil material flows through the fingers during full compression, the sample has an n value less than 0.7 (nonfluid manner of failure class).",

The indurated layer must be continuous within the limits of each pedon, but it may be fractured if the average lateral distance between fractures is 10 cm or more. The fact that this ironstone layer contains little or no organic matter distinguishes it from a placic horizon and an indurated spodic horizon (ortstein), both of which contain organic matter. Several features can aid in making the distinction between a lithic contact and a petroferric contact. First, a petroferric contact is roughly horizontal. Second, the material directly below a petroferric contact contains a high amount of iron (normally 30 percent or more Fe2 O3 ). Third, the ironstone sheets below a petroferric contact are thin; their thickness ranges from a few centimeters to very few meters. Sandstone, on the other hand, may be thin or very thick, may be level-bedded or tilted, and may contain only a small percentage of Fe2 O3 .

    "description": "Plinthite (Gr. plinthos, brick) is an iron-rich, humus-poor mixture of clay with quartz and other minerals. It commonly occurs as dark red redox concentrations that usually form platy, polygonal, or reticulate patterns. Plinthite changes irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan or to irregular aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying, especially if it is also exposed to heat from the sun. The lower boundary of a zone in which plinthite occurs generally is diffuse or gradual, but it may be abrupt at a lithologic discontinuity. Plinthite may occur as a constituent of a number of horizons, such as an epipedon, a cambic horizon, an argillic horizon, an oxic horizon, or a C horizon. It is one form of the material that has been called laterite. It normally forms in a horizon below the surface, but it may form at the surface in a seep area at the base of a slope. From a genetic viewpoint, plinthite forms by segregation of iron. In many places iron probably has been added from other horizons or from the higher adjacent soils. Generally, plinthite forms in a horizon that is saturated with water for some time during the year. Initially, iron is normally segregated in the form of soft, more or less clayey, red or dark red redox concentrations. These concentrations are not considered plinthite unless there has been enough segregation of iron to permit their irreversible hardening on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. Plinthite is firm or very firm when the soil moisture content is near field capacity and hard when the moisture content is below the wilting point. Plinthite occurs as discrete bodies larger than 2 mm that can be separated from the matrix. A moist aggregate of plinthite will withstand moderate rolling between thumb and forefinger and is less than strongly cemented. Moist or air-dried plinthite will not slake when submerged in water even with gentle agitation. Plinthite does not harden irreversibly as a result of a single cycle of drying and rewetting. After a single drying, it will remoisten and then can be dispersed in large part if one shakes it in water with a dispersing agent. In a moist soil, plinthite is soft enough to be cut with a spade. After irreversible hardening, it is no longer considered plinthite but is called ironstone. Indurated ironstone materials can be broken or shattered with a spade but cannot be dispersed if one shakes them in water with a dispersing agent. A small amount of plinthite in the soil does not form a continuous phase; that is, the individual redox concentrations or aggregates are not connected with each other. If a large amount of plinthite is present, it may form a continuous phase. Individual aggregates of plinthite in a continuous phase are interconnected, and the spacing of cracks or zones that roots can enter is 10 cm or more. If a continuous layer becomes indurated, it is a massive ironstone layer that has irregular, somewhat tubular inclusions of yellowish, grayish, or white, clayey material. If the layer is exposed, these inclusions may be washed out, leaving an ironstone that has many coarse, tubular pores. Much that has been called laterite is included in the meaning of plinthite. Doughy and concretionary laterite that has not hardened is an example. Hardened laterite, whether it is vesicular or pisolitic, is not included in the definition of plinthite.",

Weathering and mineral transformation of volcanic glass can produce short-range-order minerals, such as allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite. Volcanic glass content is the percent (by grain count) of glass, glass-coated mineral grains, glass aggregates, and glassy materials in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction. Typically, the content is determined for one particle-size fraction (i.e., coarse silt, very fine sand, or fine sand) and used as an estimate of glass content in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction. Volcanic glass content is a criterion in classification of andic soil properties, subgroups with the formative element “vitr(i),” families with “ashy” substitutes for particle-size class, and the glassy mineralogy class.",

Obviously, this definition of the term “weatherable minerals” is restrictive. The intent is to include, in the definitions of diagnostic horizons and various taxa, only those weatherable minerals that are unstable in a humid climate compared to other minerals, such as quartz and 1:1 lattice clays, but that are more resistant to weathering than calcite. Calcite, carbonate aggregates, anhydrite, gypsum, and halite are not considered weatherable minerals because they are mobile in the soil.

    "page": 26,
    "description": "Soils with aquic (L. aqua, water) conditions are those that currently undergo continuous or periodic saturation and reduction. The presence of these conditions is indicated by redoximorphic features, except in Histosols and Histels, and can be verified by measuring saturation and reduction, except in artificially drained soils. Artificial drainage is defined here as the removal of free water from soils having aquic conditions by surface mounding, ditches, or subsurface tiles or the prevention of surface or ground water from reaching the soils by dams, levees, surface pumps, or other means. In these soils water table levels and/or their duration are changed significantly in connection with specific types of land use. Upon removal of the drainage practices, aquic conditions would return. In the keys, artificially drained soils are included with soils that have aquic conditions. Elements of aquic conditions are as follows: 1. Saturation is characterized by zero or positive pressure in the soil water and can generally be determined by observing free water in an unlined auger hole. Problems may arise, however, in clayey soils with peds, where an unlined auger hole may fill with water flowing along faces of peds while the soil matrix is and remains unsaturated (bypass flow). Such free water may incorrectly suggest the presence of a water table, while the actual water table occurs at greater depth. Use of well- sealed piezometers or tensiometers is therefore recommended for measuring saturation. Problems may still occur, however, if water runs into piezometer slits near the bottom of the piezometer hole or if tensiometers with slowly reacting manometers are used. The first problem can be overcome by using piezometers with smaller slits and the second by using transducer tensiometry, which reacts faster than manometers. Soils are considered wet if they have pressure heads greater than -1 kPa. Only macropores, such as cracks between peds or channels, are then filled with air, while the soil matrix is usually still saturated. Obviously, exact measurements of the wet state can be obtained only with tensiometers. For operational purposes, the use of piezometers is recommended as a standard method. The duration of saturation required for creating aquic conditions varies, depending on the soil environment, and is not specified. Three types of saturation are defined: a. Endosaturation.—The soil is saturated with water in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 200 cm or more from the mineral soil surface. b. Episaturation.—The soil is saturated with water in one or more layers within 200 cm of the mineral soil surface and also has one or more unsaturated layers, with an upper boundary above a depth of 200 cm, below the saturated layer. The zone of saturation, i.e., the water table, is perched on top of a relatively impermeable layer. c. Anthric saturation.—This term refers to a special kind of aquic condition that occurs in soils that are cultivated and irrigated (flood irrigation). Soils with anthraquic conditions must meet the requirements for aquic conditions and in addition have both of the following: (1) A tilled surface layer and a directly underlying slowly permeable layer that has, for 3 months or more in normal years, both: (a) Saturation and reduction; and (b) Chroma of 2 or less in the matrix; and (2) A subsurface horizon with one or more of the following: (a) Redox depletions with a color value of 4 or more, moist, and chroma of 2 or less in macropores; or (b) Redox concentrations of iron and/or manganese; or (c) 2 times or more the amount of iron (extractable by dithionite-citrate) than is contained in the tilled surface layer. 2. The degree of reduction in a soil can be characterized by the direct measurement of redox potentials. Direct measurements should take into account chemical equilibria as expressed by stability diagrams in standard soil textbooks. Reduction and oxidation processes are also a function of soil pH. Obtaining accurate measurements of the degree of reduction in a soil is difficult. In the context of this taxonomy, however, only a degree of reduction that results in reduced iron is considered, because it produces the visible redoximorphic features that are identified in the keys. A simple field test is available to determine if reduced iron ions are present. A freshly broken surface of a field-wet soil sample is treated with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl in neutral, 1N ammonium acetate solution. The appearance of a strong red color on the freshly broken surface indicates the presence of reduced iron ions (i.e., Fe2+ ). A positive reaction to the alpha,alpha-dipyridyl field test for ferrous iron (Childs, 1981) may be used to confirm the existence of reducing conditions and is especially useful in situations where, despite saturation, normal morphological indicators of such conditions are either absent or obscured (as by the dark colors characteristic of melanic great groups). A negative reaction, however, does not imply that reducing conditions are always absent. It may only mean that the level of free iron in the soil is below the sensitivity limit of the test or that the soil is in an oxidized phase at the time of testing. For soils with very low levels of iron, the use of a field test such as Indicator of Reduction in Soils (IRIS) tubes painted with ferric iron may be warranted in order to document reducing conditions. Use of alpha,alpha-dipyridyl in a 10 percent solution of aceticacid is not recommended because the acid is likely to change soil conditions, for example, by dissolving CaCO3 . The duration of reduction required for creating aquic conditions is not specified. 3. Redoximorphic features associated with wetness result from alternating periods of reduction and oxidation of iron and manganese compounds in the soil. Reduction occurs during saturation with water, and oxidation occurs when the soil is not saturated. The reduced iron and manganese ions are mobile and may be transported by water as it moves through the soil. Certain redox patterns occur as a function of the patterns in which the ion-carrying water moves through the soil and as a function of the location of aerated zones in the soil. Redox patterns are also affected by the fact that manganese is reduced more rapidly than iron, while iron oxidizes more rapidly upon aeration. Characteristic color patterns are created by these processes. The reduced iron and manganese ions may be removed from a soil if vertical or lateral fluxes of water occur, in which case there is no iron or manganese precipitation in that soil. Wherever the iron and manganese are oxidized and precipitated, they form either soft masses or hard concretions or nodules. Movement of iron and manganese as a result of redox processes in a soil may result in redoximorphic features that are defined as follows: a. Redox concentrations.—These are zones of apparent accumulation of Fe-Mn oxides, including: (1) Nodules and concretions, which are cemented bodies that can be removed from the soil intact. Concretions are distinguished from nodules on the basis of internal organization. A concretion typically has concentric layers that are visible to the naked eye. Nodules do not have visible organized internal structure. Boundaries commonly are diffuse if formed in situ and sharp after pedoturbation. Sharp boundaries may be relict features in some soils; and (2) Masses, which are noncemented concentrations of substances within the soil matrix; and (3) Pore linings, i.e., zones of accumulation along pores that may be either coatings on pore surfaces or impregnations from the matrix adjacent to the pores. b. Redox depletions.—These are zones of low chroma (chromas less than those in the matrix) where either Fe- Mn oxides alone or both Fe-Mn oxides and clay have been stripped out, including: (1) Iron depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of Fe and Mn oxides but have a clay content similar to that of the adjacent matrix (often referred to as albans or neoalbans); and (2) Clay depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of Fe, Mn, and clay (often referred to as silt coatings or skeletans). c. Reduced matrix.—This is a soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air. d. In soils that have no visible redoximorphic features, a reaction to an alpha,alpha-dipyridyl solution satisfies the requirement for redoximorphic features. Field experience indicates that it is not possible to define a specific set of redoximorphic features that is uniquely characteristic of all of the taxa in one particular category. Therefore, color patterns that are unique to specific taxa are referenced in the keys. Anthraquic conditions are a variant of episaturation and are associated with controlled flooding (for such crops as wetland rice and cranberries), which causes reduction processes in the saturated, puddled surface soil and oxidation of reduced and mobilized iron and manganese in the unsaturated subsoil.",

Annual precipitation that is plus or minus one standard deviation of the long-term (30 years or more) mean annual precipitation; and 2. Mean monthly precipitation that is plus or minus one standard deviation of the long-term monthly precipitation for 8 of the 12 months. For the most part, normal years can be calculated from the mean annual precipitation; however, when catastrophic events occur during a year, the standard deviations of the monthly means should also be calculated. The term “normal years” replaces the terms “most years” and “6 out of 10 years,” which were used in the previous edition of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1975). When precipitation data are evaluated to determine if the criterion for the presence of aquic conditions, or number of days that the moisture control section is moist, or number of days that some part of the soil is saturated has been met, it is permissible to include data from periods with below normal rainfall. Similarly, when precipitation data are evaluated to determine if the criterion for the number of days that the moisture control section is dry has been met, it is permissible to include data from periods with above normal rainfall. It is assumed that if the criteria are met during these periods, they will also be met during normal years.",

    "description": "The intent in defining the soil moisture control section is to facilitate estimation of soil moisture regimes from climatic data. The upper boundary of this control section is the depth to which a dry (tension of more than 1500 kPa, but not air-dry) soil will be moistened by 2.5 cm of water within 24 hours. The lower boundary is the depth to which a dry soil will be moistened by 7.5 cm of water within 48 hours. These depths do not include the depth of moistening along any cracks or animal burrows that are open to the surface. If 7.5 cm of water moistens the soil to a densic, lithic, paralithic, or petroferric contact or to a petrocalcic or petrogypsic horizon or a duripan, the contact or the upper boundary of the cemented horizon constitutes the lower boundary of the soil moisture control section. If a soil is moistened to one of these contacts or horizons by 2.5 cm of water, the soil moisture control section is the boundary of the contact itself. The control section of such a soil is considered moist if the contact or upper boundary of the cemented horizon has a thin film of water. If that upper boundary is dry, the control section is considered dry. The moisture control section of a soil extends approximately (1) from 10 to 30 cm below the soil surface if the particle-size class of the soil is fine-loamy, coarse-silty, fine-silty, or clayey; (2) from 20 to 60 cm if the particle-size class is coarse-loamy; and (3) from 30 to 90 cm if the particle-size class is sandy. If the soil contains rock and pararock fragments that do not absorb and release water, the limits of the moisture control section are deeper. The limits of the soil moisture control section are affected not only by the particle-size class but also by differences in soil structure or pore-size distribution or by other factors that influence the movement and retention of water in the soil.",

    "description": "The soil moisture regimes are defined in terms of the level of ground water and in terms of the seasonal presence or absence of water held at a tension of less than 1500 kPa in the moisture control section. It is assumed in the definitions that the soil supports whatever vegetation it is capable of supporting, i.e., crops, grass, or native vegetation, and that the amount of stored moisture is not being increased by irrigation or fallowing. These cultural practices affect the soil moisture conditions as long as they are continued. Aquic soil moisture regime.—The aquic (L. aqua, water) soil moisture regime is a reducing regime in a soil that is virtually free of dissolved oxygen because it is saturated by water. Some soils are saturated with water at times while dissolved oxygen is present, either because the water is moving or because the environment is unfavorable for micro-organisms (e.g., if the temperature is less than 1 o C); such a regime is not considered aquic. It is not known how long a soil must be saturated before it is said to have an aquic soil moisture regime, but the duration must be at least a few days, because it is implicit in the concept that dissolved oxygen is virtually absent. Because dissolved oxygen is removed from ground water by respiration of micro- organisms, roots, and soil fauna, it is also implicit in the concept that the soil temperature is above biologic zero for some time while the soil is saturated. Biologic zero is defined as 5 o C in this taxonomy. In some of the very cold regions of the world, however, biological activity occurs at temperatures below 5 o C. Very commonly, the level of ground water fluctuates with the seasons; it is highest in the rainy season or in fall, winter, or spring if cold weather virtually stops evapotranspiration. There are soils, however, in which the ground water is always at or very close to the surface. Examples are soils in tidal marshes or in closed, landlocked depressions fed by perennial streams. Such soils are considered to have a peraquic soil moisture regime. Aridic and torric (L. aridus, dry, and L. torridus, hot and dry) soil moisture regimes.—These terms are used for the same moisture regime but in different categories of the taxonomy. In the aridic (torric) soil moisture regime, the moisture control section is, in normal years: 1. Dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is above 5 o C; and 2. Moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is above 8 o C. Soils that have an aridic (torric) soil moisture regime normally occur in areas of arid climates. A few are in areas of semiarid climates and either have physical properties that keep them dry, such as a crusty surface that virtually precludes the infiltration of water, or are on steep slopes where runoff is high. There is little or no leaching in this soil moisture regime, and soluble salts accumulate in the soils if there is a source. The limits set for soil temperature exclude from these soil moisture regimes soils in the very cold and dry polar regions and in areas at high elevations. Such soils are considered to have anhydrous conditions (defined earlier). Udic soil moisture regime.—The udic (L. udus, humid) soil moisture regime is one in which the soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years. If the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 o C and if the mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface differ by 6 o C or more, the soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. In addition, the udic soil moisture regime requires, except for short periods, a three- phase system, solid-liquid-gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 o C. The udic soil moisture regime is common to the soils of humid climates that have well distributed rainfall; have enough rain in summer so that the amount of stored moisture plus rainfall is approximately equal to, or exceeds, the amount of evapotranspiration; or have adequate winter rains to recharge the soils and cool, foggy summers, as in coastal areas. Water moves downward through the soils at some time in normal years. In climates where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years, the moisture tension rarely reaches 100 kPa in the soil moisture control section, although there are occasional brief periods when some stored moisture is used. The water moves through the soil in all months when it is not frozen. Such an extremely wet soil moisture regime is called perudic (L. per, throughout in time, and L. udus, humid). In the names of most taxa, the formative element “ud” is used to indicate either a udic or a perudic regime; the formative element “per” is used in selected taxa. Ustic soil moisture regime.—The ustic (L. ustus, burnt; implying dryness) soil moisture regime is intermediate between the aridic regime and the udic regime. Its concept is one of moisture that is limited but is present at a time when conditions are suitable for plant growth. The concept of the ustic soil moisture regime is not applied to soils that have permafrost (defined above). If the mean annual soil temperature is 22 o C or higher or if the mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 o C at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface, the soil moisture control section in areas of the ustic soil moisture regime is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years. It is moist, however, in some part either for more than 180 cumulative days per year or for 90 or more consecutive days. If the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 o C and if the mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by 6 o C or more at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface, the soil moisture control section in areas of the ustic soil moisture regime is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years, but it is not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 5 o C. If in normal years the moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice, the moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. In tropical and subtropical regions that have a monsoon climate with either one or two dry seasons, summer and winter seasons have little meaning. In those regions the soil moisture regime is ustic if there is at least one rainy season of 3 months or more. In temperate regions of subhumid or semiarid climates, the rainy seasons are usually spring and summer or spring and fall, but never winter. Native plants are mostly annuals or plants that have a dormant period while the soil is dry. Xeric soil moisture regime.—The xeric (Gr. xeros, dry) soil moisture regime is the typical moisture regime in areas of Mediterranean climates, where winters are moist and cool and summers are warm and dry. The moisture, which falls during the winter, when potential evapotranspiration is at a minimum, is particularly effective for leaching. In areas of a xeric soil moisture regime, the soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. Also, in normal years, the moisture control section is moist in some part for more than half of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is higher than 5 o C or for 90 or more consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 8 o C. The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 o C, and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact if shallower. Soil Temperature Regimes Classes of Soil Temperature Regimes Following is a description of the soil temperature regimes used in defining classes at various categorical levels in this taxonomy. Gelic (L. gelare, to freeze).— Soils in this temperature regime have a mean annual soil temperature at or below 0 o (in Gelic suborders and Gelic great groups) or 1 o C or lower (in Gelisols) either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Cryic (Gr. kryos, coldness; indicating very cold soils).—Soils in this temperature regime have a mean annual temperature between 0 and 8 o C but do not have permafrost. 1. In mineral soils the mean summer soil temperature (June, July, and August in the Northern Hemisphere and December, January, and February in the Southern Hemisphere) either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower, is as follows: a. If the soil is not saturated with water during some part of the summer and (1) If there is no O horizon: between 0 and 15 o C; or (2) If there is an O horizon: between 0 and 8 o C; or b. If the soil is saturated with water during some part of the summer and (1) If there is no O horizon: between 0 and 13 o C; or (2) If there is an O horizon or a histic epipedon: between 0 and 6 o C. 2. In organic soils the mean annual soil temperature is between 0 and 6 o C. Cryic soils that have an aquic soil moisture regime commonly are churned by frost. Isofrigid soils can also have a cryic soil temperature regime. A few with organic materials in the upper part are exceptions. The concepts of the soil temperature regimes described below are used in defining classes of soils in the lower categories of soil taxonomy (i.e., family and soil series). Frigid.—A soil with a frigid soil temperature regime is warmer in summer than a soil with a cryic regime, but its mean annual temperature is between 0 and 8 o C and the difference between mean summer (June, July, and August) and mean winter (December, January, and February) soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Mesic.—The mean annual soil temperature is 8 o C or higher but lower than 15 o C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Thermic.—The mean annual soil temperature is 15 o C or higher but lower than 22 o C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Hyperthermic.—The mean annual soil temperature is 22 o or higher, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. If the name of a soil temperature regime has the prefix iso, the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 o C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Isofrigid.—The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 8 o C. Isomesic.—The mean annual soil temperature is 8 o C or higher but lower than 15 o C. Isothermic.—The mean annual soil temperature is 15 o C or higher but lower than 22 o C. Isohyperthermic.—The mean annual soil temperature is 22 or C or higher.",

    "description": "Sulfidic materials contain oxidizable sulfur compounds (elemental S or most commonly sulfide minerals, such as pyrite or iron monosulfides). They are mineral or organic soil materials that have a pH value of more than 3.5 and that become significantly more acid when oxidized. Sulfidic materials accumulate as a soil or sediment that is permanently saturated, generally with brackish water. The sulfates in the water are biologically reduced to sulfides as the materials accumulate. Sulfidic materials most commonly accumulate in coastal marshes near the mouth of rivers that carry noncalcareous sediments, but they may occur in freshwater marshes if there is sulfur in the water. Upland sulfidic materials may have accumulated in a similar manner in the geologic past. If a soil containing sulfidic materials is drained or if sulfidic materials are otherwise exposed to aerobic conditions, the sulfides oxidize and form sulfuric acid. The pH value, which normally is near neutrality before drainage or exposure, may drop below 3. The acid may induce the formation of iron and aluminum sulfates. The iron hydroxysulfate mineral jarosite may segregate, forming the yellow redoximorphic concentrations that commonly characterize a sulfuric horizon. The transition from sulfidic materials to a sulfuric horizon normally requires only a few months and may occur within a few weeks. A sample of sulfidic materials, if air-dried slowly in shade for about 2 months with occasional remoistening, becomes extremely acid.",

    "description": "Brackish water sediments frequently contain pyrite or other iron sulfide minerals (or, rarely, elemental sulfur), which form sulfuric acid upon the oxidation of the sulfur forms they contain and/or upon the oxidation and hydrolysis of the iron in the iron sulfides. Pyrite is an iron sulfide mineral that forms as a result of the microbial decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Pyrite forms after iron oxide and sulfate from sea water (or other sources) become reduced to ferrous iron and sulfide, respectively, and then combine to form a very insoluble compound (see description of the sulfidization process given by Fanning and Fanning, 1989, or Fanning et al., 2002). Characteristically, the pyrite crystals occur as nests or framboids composed of bipyramidal crystals of pyrite. In an oxidizing environment, pyrite oxidizes and the products of oxidation (and the hydrolysis of the ferric iron produced) are iron oxides (and under sufficiently acidic and oxidizing conditions, jarosite and/or schwertmannite) and sulfuric acid. The jarosite has a straw-yellow color and frequently lines pores in the soil. Jarosite concentrations are among the indicators of a sulfuric horizon, but jarosite is not present in all sulfuric horizons. The low pH and high amount of soluble sulfates, and/or underlying sulfidic materials, are other indicators of a sulfuric horizon. A quick test of sulfidic materials is a rapid fall in pH on drying or after treatment with an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide. A sulfuric (L. sulfur) horizon forms as a result of drainage (most commonly artificial drainage) and oxidation of sulfide- rich mineral or organic soil materials. It can form in areas where sulfidic materials have been exposed as a result of surface mining, dredging, or other earth-moving operations. A sulfuric horizon is detrimental to most plants and, if sufficiently acid at the soil surface, may prevent plant growth or limit it to certain plant species, such as Phragmites australis, that can tolerate the acidity under certain conditions.",

It occurs in soils that have either been used for gardening, been deeply mixed in place, excavated and replaced, or compacted in place for the artificial ponding of water. ‡ Surfaces that formed by shearing intersect irregularly in diverging and converging directions. Human-altered material may be composed of either organic or mineral soil material. It may contain artifacts (e.g., shells or bones) used as agricultural amendments, but the majority of the material has no evidence that it was transported from outside of the pedon. Human-altered material occurs in soils which are disturbed for various reasons. For example, human-altered material occurs in agricultural soils which are deeply-plowed or ripped to disrupt a root-limiting layer (defined in chapter 17) or other physical restriction. Gravesites in cemeteries contain human- altered material as well as artifacts. Densic contacts form at the top of wet, slowly permeable (i.e., puddled) layers when they are compacted by humans and destroy structure and impede water percolation. Subsequent artificial ponding in such human- altered material results in anthric saturation (defined above) for the purpose of growing crops like rice in paddy soils. Diagnostic horizons formed by significant illuviation (e.g., argillic or petrocalcic horizons) have not been documented as occurring in human-altered material.

In some cases it is not possible to distinguish between human-transported material and parent material from mass movement processes (e.g., landslides) without intensive onsite examination and analysis. Human-transported material may be composed of either organic or mineral soil material and may contain detached pieces of diagnostic horizons which are derived from excavated soils.

    "description": "Transported Soils The following subgroup adjectives recognize distinct groups of human-altered and human-transported soils. Soils using these adjectives are considered extragrades since they do not represent an intergrade to any other named taxon (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). They are listed in order of interpretive significance as a guide, but the significance and order may change slightly depending on the great group in which they are recognized. They are not used in combination with each other even though some soils may have properties of several subgroups. These adjectives may be combined alphabetically with adjectives connoting other soil properties, such as high organic matter content (e.g., Anthropic Humic) or the presence of sulfidic materials (e.g., Anthroportic Sulfic), to form the names for additional extragrade subgroups. Additional adjectives for other properties will generally increase the importance of the subgroup and result in higher placement within a key to subgroups. 1. Anthraquic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. aqua, water). Soils that have anthraquic conditions (i.e., anthric saturation). These soils are extensive in flooded rice paddies. 2. Anthrodensic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. densus, marked by compactness). Soils that have a densic contact due to mechanical compaction (e.g., a compacted mine spoil) in more than 90 percent of the pedon (measured laterally) within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface. 3. Anthropic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human). Soils that have an anthropic epipedon based on the presence of artifacts or midden material. 4. Plaggic (modified from Ger. plaggen, sod). Soils that have a plaggen epipedon. 5. Haploplaggic (Gr. haplous, simple, and Ger. plaggen, sod). Soils that have a surface horizon 25 cm to less than 50 cm thick that meets all of the requirements for a plaggen epipedon except thickness. 6. Anthroportic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. portāre, to carry). Soils that formed in 50 cm or more of human- transported material. This adjective is used primarily for soils that formed in human-transported material of dredged or mine spoil areas as well as for soils of urban areas and transportation corridors. 7. Anthraltic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. alterāre, to change). Soils that formed in 50 cm or more of human-altered material. This adjective is used primarily for human-altered material where ripping or deep plowing has fractured and displaced diagnostic subsurface horizons that were root-limiting (e.g., duripans) and in excavated areas (e.g., borrow pits).

    "description": "Mineral Layers of Some Organic Soils The following differentiae are used to distinguish families of mineral soils and the mineral layers of some organic soils within a subgroup. The class names of these differentiae are used to form the family name. The class names are listed and defined in the same sequence (shown below) in which they appear in the family names. Particle-size classes and their substitutes Human-altered and human-transported material classes Mineralogy classes Cation-exchange activity classes Calcareous and reaction classes Soil temperature classes Soil depth classes Rupture-resistance classes Classes of coatings on sands Classes of permanent cracks Particle-Size Classes and Their Substitutes Definition of Particle-Size Classes and Their Substitutes for Mineral Soils The first part of the family name is the name of either a particle-size class or a substitute for a particle-size class. The term particle-size class is used to characterize the grain-size composition of the whole soil, including both the fine earth and the rock and pararock fragments up to the size of a pedon, but it excludes organic matter and salts more soluble than gypsum. Substitutes for particle-size classes are used for soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, cinders, rock fragments, or gypsum. The particle-size classes of this taxonomy represent a compromise between conventional divisions in pedologic and engineering classifications. Engineering classifications have set the limit between sand and silt at a diameter of 74 microns, while pedological classifications have set it at either 20, 50, or 63 microns. The USDA and this taxonomy use a diameter of 50 microns to set the limit between sand and silt. Engineering classifications have been based on grain-size percentages, by weight, in the soil fraction less than 75 mm (3 inches) in diameter, while texture classes in pedologic classifications have been based on percentages, by weight, in the fraction less than 2.0 mm in diameter. In engineering classifications, the separate very fine sand (diameter between 50 and 100 microns or 0.05 and 0.1 mm) has been subdivided at 74 microns. In defining the particle-size classes for this taxonomy, a similar division has been made, but in a different way. Soil materials that have a texture class of fine sand or loamy fine sand normally have an appreciable amount of very fine sand, most of which is coarser than 74 microns. A silty sediment, such as loess, may also contain an appreciable amount of very fine sand, most of which is finer than 74 microns. Thus, in the design of particle-size classes for this taxonomy, the very fine sand has been allowed to “float.” It is included with the sand fraction if the texture class (fine-earth fraction) of a soil is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or coarser. It is treated as silt, however, if the texture class is very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, silt loam, or finer. No single set of particle-size classes seems adequate to serve as family differentiae for all of the different kinds of soil. Thus, this taxonomy provides 2 generalized and 10 more narrowly defined classes, which permit relatively fine distinctions between families of soils for which particle size is important, while providing broader groupings for soils in which narrowly defined particle-size classes would produce undesirable separations. Thus, the term “clayey” is used for some soil families to indicate a clay content of 35 percent (30 percent in Vertisols) or more in specific horizons, while in other families the more narrowly defined terms “fine” and “very-fine” indicate that these horizons have a clay content either of 35 (30 percent in Vertisols) to 60 percent or of 60 percent or more in their fine-earth fraction. Fine earth refers to particles smaller than 2 mm in diameter. Rock fragments are particles 2 mm or more in diameter that are strongly cemented or more resistant to rupture and include all particles with horizontal dimensions smaller than the size of a pedon. Cemented fragments 2 mm or more in diameter that are in a rupture-resistance class that is less cemented than the strongly cemented class are referred to as pararock fragments. Pararock fragments, like rock fragments, include all particles between 2 mm and a horizontal dimension smaller than the size of a pedon. Most pararock fragments Family and Series Differentiae and Names are broken into particles less than 2 mm in diameter during the preparation of samples for particle-size analysis in the laboratory. Therefore, pararock fragments are generally included with the fine earth in the assignment of particle-size classes. However, cinders, lapilli, pumice, and pumicelike fragments are treated as general fragments in the pumiceous and cindery substitute classes (defined below), regardless of their rupture- resistance class. Rock fragments and pararock fragments may be of either geologic or pedogenic origin. Artifacts (defined in chapter 3) are of human origin. Artifacts 2 mm or larger in diameter which are both cohesive and persistent* (e.g., brick) are treated as rock fragments for the assignment of particle-size classes. Substitutes for particle-size classes are used for soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, cinders, rock fragments, or gypsum. These materials cannot be readily dispersed and have variable results of dispersion. The substitute classes dominated by rock and pararock fragments have too little fine-earth material for valid data, and soil properties are dominated by the fragments. Consequently, normal particle-size classes do not adequately characterize these soils. Substitutes for particle-size class names are used for those parts of soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, or cinders, as is the case with Andisols and many Andic and Vitrandic subgroups of other soil orders. The “gypseous” substitutes for particle- size class are used for mineral soils (e.g., Aridisols) that have a high content of gypsum. Some Spodosols, whether identified in Andic subgroups or not, have andic soil properties in some horizons within the particle-size control section, and particle- size substitute class names are used for these horizons. Neither a particle-size class nor a substitute for a particle-size class is used for Psamments, Psammaquents, Psammowassents, Psammoturbels, Psammorthels, and Psammentic subgroups that meet sandy particle-size class criteria. These taxa, by definition, meet sandy particle-size class criteria (i.e., have a texture class of sand or loamy sand), so the sandy particle-size class is considered redundant in the family name. The ashy substitute class, however, is used, if appropriate in these taxa (e.g., high content of volcanic glass). Particle-size classes are applied, although with reservations, to the control sections of soils with spodic horizons and other horizons that do not have andic soil properties but contain significant amounts of allophane, imogolite, ferrihydrite, or aluminum-humus complexes. The isotic mineralogy class (defined below) is helpful in identifying these particle-size classes. In general, the weighted average particle-size class of the whole particle-size control section (defined below) determines what particle-size class is used for the family name. Strongly Contrasting Particle-Size Classes If the particle-size control section consists of two parts with strongly contrasting particle-size or substitute classes (listed below), if both parts are 12.5 cm or more thick (including parts not in the control section), and if the transition zone between them is less than 12.5 cm thick, both class names are used. For example, the family particle-size class is sandy over clayey if all of the following criteria are met: the soil meets criterion D (listed below) under the control section for particle-size classes or their substitutes; any Ap horizon is less than 30 cm thick; the weighted average particle-size class of the upper 30 cm of the soil is sandy; the weighted average of the lower part is clayey; and the transition zone is less than 12.5 cm thick. If a substitute name applies to one or more parts of the particle-size control section and the parts are not strongly contrasting classes, the name of the thickest part (cumulative) is used as the soil family name. Aniso Class If the particle-size control section includes more than one pair of the strongly contrasting classes, listed below, then the soil is assigned to an aniso class named for the pair of adjacent classes that contrast most strongly. The aniso class is considered a modifier of the particle-size class name and is set off by commas after the particle-size name. An example is a sandy over clayey, aniso, mixed, active, mesic Aridic Haplustoll. Generalized Particle-Size Classes Two generalized particle-size classes, loamy and clayey, are used for shallow classes (defined below) and for soils in Arenic, Grossarenic, and Lithic subgroups. The clayey class is used for all strongly contrasting particle-size classes with more than 35 percent clay (30 percent in Vertisols). The loamy particle- size class is used for contrasting classes, where appropriate, to characterize the lower part of the particle-size control section. The generalized classes, where appropriate, are also used for all strongly contrasting particle-size classes that include a substitute class. For example, loamy over pumiceous or cindery (not fine-loamy over pumiceous or cindery) is used. Six generalized classes, defined later in this chapter, are used for Terric subgroups of Histosols and Histels.",

Persistent artifacts remain intact for a decade or more.

Root-Limiting Layers The concept of root-limiting layers as used in this taxonomy defines the base of the soil horizons considered for most (but not all) differentiae at the family level. The properties of soil materials above the base and within the control section are used for assignment of classes, such as particle-size classes and their substitutes. One notable exception to the concept of root- limiting layers is in assignment of soil depth classes (defined below) to soils with fragipans. Unless otherwise indicated, the following are considered root-limiting layers in this chapter: a duripan; a fragipan; petrocalcic, petrogypsic, and placic horizons; continuous ortstein (i.e., 90 percent or more cemented and has lateral continuity); and densic, lithic, manufactured layer, paralithic, and petroferric contacts. Key to the Control Section for Particle-Size Classes and Their Substitutes in Mineral Soils The following list of particle-size control sections for particular kinds of mineral soils is arranged as a key.

This boundary is not always obvious. If one of these horizons is present but the upper boundary is irregular or broken, as in an A/B or B/A horizon, the depth at which half or more of the volume has the fabric of an argillic, natric, or kandic horizon should be considered the upper boundary.",

    "description": "The purpose of strongly contrasting particle-size classes is to identify changes in pore-size distribution or composition that are not identified in higher soil categories and that seriously affect the movement and retention of water and/or nutrients. The particle-size or substitute classes listed below are considered strongly contrasting if both parts are 12.5 cm or more thick (including the thickness of these parts not entirely within the particle-size control section; however, substitute class names are used only if the soil materials to which they apply extend 10 cm or more into the upper part of the particle-size control section) and if the transition zone between the two parts of the particle-size control section is less than 12.5 cm thick. Some classes, such as sandy and sandy-skeletal, have been combined in the following list. In those cases the combined name is used as the family class if part of the control section meets the criteria for either class.

    "description": "The cation-exchange activity classes help in making interpretations about the nutrient-holding capacity of soils and their suites of colloids. The cation-exchange capacity is determined by NH4 OAc at pH 7 on the fine-earth fraction. The CEC of the organic matter, sand, silt, and clay is included in the determination. The criteria for the classes use ratios of CEC to the percent, by weight, of silicate clay, calculated by weighted average in the control section. In the following classes “clay” excludes clay-size carbonates. Percent carbonate clay must be subtracted from percent total clay before calculating the CEC to clay ratio. If the ratio of percent water retained at 1500 kPa tension to the percentage of measured clay is 0.25 or less or 0.6 or more in half or more of the particle-size control section (or in a part of contrasting families), then the percentage of clay is estimated by the following formula: Clay % = 2.5(% water retained at 1500 kPa tension - % organic carbon). See appendix for more information. Use of the Cation-Exchange Activity Classes The cation-exchange activity classes are used for soils classified in the mixed or siliceous mineralogy classes of clayey, clayey-skeletal, coarse-loamy, coarse-silty, fine, fine-loamy, fine-silty, loamy, loamy-skeletal, and very-fine particle-size classes. Cation-exchange activity classes are not assigned to Histosols and Histels nor to Oxisols or “kandi” and “kanhap” great groups and subgroups of Alfisols and Ultisols because assigning classes to organic soils or taxa defined by low-activity clay would be misleading or redundant information. Cation- exchange activity classes are not assigned to Psamments, “psamm” great groups of Entisols and Gelisols, Psammentic subgroups, or other soils with sandy or sandy-skeletal particle- size classes or the fragmental substitute class because the low clay content causes cation-exchange activity classes to be less useful and less reliable. Soils with other substitutes for particle- size class (e.g., ashy) or with mineralogy classes such as smectitic also are not assigned cation-exchange activity classes, since such soils have a high cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and/or the clay mineralogy dictates soil properties. For soils with strongly contrasting particle-size classes, where both named parts of the control section use a cation- exchange activity class, the class associated with the particle- size class that has the most clay is named. For example, in a pedon with a classification of fine-loamy over clayey, mixed, active, calcareous, thermic Typic Udorthent, the cation- exchange activity class “active” is associated with the clayey, lower part of the control section. For other soils with strongly contrasting particle-size classes, where one named part of the control section uses a cation-exchange activity class and one named part does not, the class is associated with the part which requires usage. For example, in a pedon with a classification of coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvent, the cation-exchange activity class “superactive” is associated with the coarse-loamy, upper part of the control section. Control Section for Cation-Exchange Activity Classes The control section for cation-exchange activity classes is the same as that used to determine the particle-size and mineralogy classes.",

    "description": "The function of the series is pragmatic, and differences within a family that affect the use of a soil should be considered in classifying soil series. The separation of soils at the series level of this taxonomy can be based on any property that is used as criteria at higher levels in the system. The criteria most commonly used include presence of, depth to, thickness of, and expression of horizons and properties diagnostic for the higher categories and differences in texture, mineralogy, soil moisture, soil temperature, and amounts of organic matter. The limits of the properties used as differentiae must be more narrowly defined than the limits for the family. The properties used, however, must be reliably observable or be inferable from other soil properties or from the setting or vegetation. The differentiae used must be within the series control section. Differences in soil or regolith that are outside the series control section and that have not been recognized as series differentiae but are relevant to potential uses of certain soils are considered as a basis for phase distinctions.",

    "description": "The control section for the soil series is similar to that for the family, but it differs in a few important respects. The particle-size and mineralogy control sections for families end at the upper boundary of certain diagnostic subsurface horizons, such as a duripan, fragipan, or petrocalcic horizon, because these horizons have few roots. The thickness of such root-limiting horizons is taken into account in differentiating concepts of competing soil series, when they occur within the series control section. In contrast, the thickness of such horizons is not used in the control sections for the family. The series control section includes materials starting at the soil surface and extends into the first 25 cm of densic materials, a manufactured layer, or paralithic materials, if the densic, manufactured layer, or paralithic contacts, respectively, are less than 125 cm below the mineral soil surface. In contrast, the properties of materials below any densic, lithic, manufactured layer, paralithic, or petroferric contact are not used for classification in the categories above the series (i.e., order through family). The properties of horizons and layers below the particle-size control section, a depth between 100 and 150 cm (or to 200 cm if in a diagnostic horizon) from the mineral soil surface, also are considered in the series category of this taxonomy.",
